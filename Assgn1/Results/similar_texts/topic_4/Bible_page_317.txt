over his wife, and shall set the woman before the Lord, and the 
priest shall execute upon her all this law.

bear her iniquity.

6  ¶ All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall 
come at no dead body. 
7  He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,

pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation:
