THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
23. Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga
should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.
Sankalpaprabhavaan kaamaan styaktwaa sarvaan asheshatah;
Manasaivendriyagraamam viniyamya samantatah.
24. Abandoning without reserve all the desires born of Sankalpa, and completely restraining
the whole group of senses by the mind from all sides,
COMMENTARY: The mind is so diplomatic that it keeps certain desires for its secret
gratification. So one should completely abandon all desires without reservation.
Shanaih shanairuparamed buddhyaa dhritigriheetayaa;
Aatmasamstham manah kritwaa na kinchidapi chintayet.
25. Little by little let him attain to quietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the
mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.
Yato yato nishcharati manashchanchalamasthiram;
Tatastato niyamyaitad aatmanyeva vasham nayet.
26. From whatever cause the restless, unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him
restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.
Prashaantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam;
Upaiti shaantarajasam brahmabhootamakalmasham.
27. Supreme bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is quite peaceful, whose passion is
quieted, who has become Brahman, and who is free from sin.
Yunjannevam sadaaâ€™tmaanam yogee vigatakalmashah;
Sukhena brahmasamsparsham atyantam sukham ashnute.
28. The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins,
easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).
Sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani;
Eekshate yogayuktaatmaa sarvatra samadarshanah.
29. With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings
in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.
Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati;
Tasyaaham na pranashyaami sa cha me na pranashyati.
