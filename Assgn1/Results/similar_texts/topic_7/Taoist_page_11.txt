spiritual alchemy, and the admonitions and instructions of
the great luminaries of Taoist spirituality through the ages.
The  fifth  selection  is  a  discourse  on  the  mental
refinement represented by the science of spiritual alchemy.
It  is  attributed  to  Zhang  Sanfeng,  a  semimythological
figure of the Ming dynasty to whom, or to whose school, a
great  many  works  of  this  genre  are  attributed.  Zhang
Sanfeng was supposed to have been a great alchemist and
is traditionally associated with the form of exercise known
as Taijiquan, or Tai Chi Chuan.
Presented  here  is  a  text  entitled  Zhang  Sanfeng’s  Taiji
Alchemy  Secrets.  Just  as  martial  artists,  such  as  Shaolin
boxers  and  Zen  duelers  and  archers,  commonly  practiced
meditation,  the  interior  foundation  of  Tai  Chi  is  also
traditionally  associated  with  internal  meditation  practice.
This alchemy too is based on awareness of the connection
between  mind  and  body,  and  its  exercise  raises  the
physical practice of Tai Chi now quite popular in the West,
to a greater level of total fulfillment.
The  sixth  and  final  selection  in  this  volume  is  taken
from Secret Records of Understanding the Way, a rare and
remarkable  manuscript  collection  of  talks  by  an
anonymous Taoist known only by a devotional name. This
appears  to  be  a  work  of  the  late  Qing  dynasty  (1644–
1911), clearly following traditional lines yet with a candor
characteristic of modern times.
