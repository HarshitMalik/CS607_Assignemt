As  for  the  word  wizard,  the  Chinese  character  comes
from “human” and “mountain.” As a mountain is still, this
has  the  meaning  of  always  being  stable,  always  being
calm.  If  people  can  be  like  mountains,  they  can  become
wizards.
Putting  down  is  buddhahood,  raising  up  is  wizardry;
how can one become a sage? There is only one, not two or
three;  on  examination,  Confucianism,  Buddhism,  and
Taoism are all realized through freedom from desire.
Some ask, “As we learn to become sages, what can we
do about the difficulty of getting rid of the force of habit?”
The  answer  is  that  it  only  seems  difficult  because  you
aren’t willing to get rid of it. If you were willing to get rid
of it, it would soon stop. Why? All force of habit is unreal;
when  the  mind  is  deluded,  it  seems  to  exist,  but  it  is  not
there  when  the  mind  is  enlightened.  It  is  not  that  it
becomes  nonexistent  on  enlightenment;  it  is  originally
nonexistent.
