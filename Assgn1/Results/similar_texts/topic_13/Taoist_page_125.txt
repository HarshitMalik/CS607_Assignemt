The five mental times are:
1.  more movement than stillness
2.  equal movement and stillness
3.  more stillness than movement
4.  stillness when there is nothing to do, movement
when something impinges
5.  the mind merged with the Way, not stirring even
on impact
Only when you reach this last stage do you finally attain
peace;  the  dirt  of  sin  entirely  gone,  you  no  longer  suffer
vexation.
The seven physical phases are:
1.  one’s action accords with the time, one’s
countenance is gentle and pleasant;
2.  chronic ailments all dissolve, body and mind are
light and fresh;
3.  youthful damage is repaired, the basis is restored,
and life is revived;
4.  the life span is extended thousands of years—
people like this are called immortals;
5.  the physical body is refined into energy—people
like this are called real humans;
6.  energy is refined into spirit—people like this are
called spiritual humans;
7.  the spirit is refined to merge with the Way—
people like this are called perfected humans.
