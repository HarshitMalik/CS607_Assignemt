The wise do not lose time, the brave do not think twice.
If you get to know the Way today, you should set to work
this very day; when you know, that is when to start. If you
say  you  do  not  have  the  leisure  today  and  will  wait  for
another  day,  I’m  afraid  that  when  you  want  to  do  it  you
won’t be able to anymore.
Human  beings  have  three  treasures—vitality,  energy,
and spirit. In old age, beware of exhausting vitality; when
vitality is exhausted, you die. In old age, beware of leaking
energy; if energy is drained, you die. In old age, beware of
dissociation of the spirit; if the spirit is gone, you die.
How can you avoid exhausting vitality? Is it necessary
to  stay  away  from  sex?  How  can  you  avoid  leaking
energy? Is it necessary to speak little? How can you avoid
dissociation of spirit? Is it necessary to be desireless? The
spirit  cannot  be  stabilized  by  force;  when  the  mind  and
breathing  rest  on  each  other,  then  the  spirit  naturally
stabilizes.  Energy  is  not  to  be  drained  casually;  forget
words  and  keep  centered  and  energy  is  not  drained.
Vitality  is  not  to  be  lost  through  leakage;  recirculate
vitality to replenish the brain and vitality does not leak.
Some  ask,  when  people  age  and  their  physical  energy
has  deteriorated,  how  can  it  be  replenished?  By  being
careful  of  your  speech  you  can  replenish  your  lungs.  By
moderating  food  and  drink  you  can  replenish  your
stomach. By stopping worry you can replenish your heart.
By  getting  rid  of  anger  you  can  replenish  your  liver.  By
