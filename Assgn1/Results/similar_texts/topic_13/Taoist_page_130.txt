When  your  mind  does  not  race,  then  your  nature  is
stable.
When  your  body  is  not  belabored,  then  your  vitality  is
complete.
When your spirit is not disturbed, the elixir crystallizes.
After  that  you  extinguish  feelings  in  emptiness  and
settle the spirit in the absolute.
This can be called attainment of the subtle Way without
leaving home.
PREPAREDNESS
Everything  requires  preparedness,  for  then  there  is  no
trouble.
So  if  those  who  work  on  the  Way  would  control  their
emotions  and  desires  when  they  are  young,  thus  making
early  preparations  for  it,  then  spiritual  immortality  is
possible.
If  you  wait  until  you  are  old  and  your  willpower  and
energy are declining, it will be too late to study the Way.
CLARITY AND PURITY
Clarity  and  purity  mean  clarifying  the  mind  source  and
purifying the energy ocean.
When  the  mind  source  is  clear,  external  things  cannot
disturb it, so feelings settle and spiritual illumination takes
place.
