interval  of  a  breath,  then  they  are  not  complete  for  the
interval of a breath.
People  have  three  valleys.  Their  emptiness  is  like  a
valley, and the spirit dwells there, so it is called the valley
spirit.
The  top  one  is  called  the  celestial  valley;  this  is  the
nirvana center, the root of heaven, the original chamber of
the spirit.
When  the  spirit  dwells  in  the  celestial  valley,  then
vitality changes into energy and the energy rises.
After  nine  years,  the  celestial  chamber  is  full,  and  the
celestial gateway is thereby opened up.
The middle one is called the valley of response. This is
the  crimson  chamber,  the  bright  auditorium  where
government is administered.
When the spirit dwells in the valley of response, the ears
hear,  the  eyes  see,  the  five  sense  do  their  jobs,  and  the
whole body follows along.
The  lower  one  is  called  the  valley  of  soul.  This  is  the
elixir field. This is the secret room of hidden cultivation.
When the spirit dwells in the valley of soul, looking and
listening  are  turning  inward,  spirit  and  energy  keep
together,  and  vitality  and  consciousness  thereby  embrace
as one.
