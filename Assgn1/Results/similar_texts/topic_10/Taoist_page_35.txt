shortness  of  breath.  Mixing  with  blood,  they  produce
bowel  obstruction;  mixing  with  water,  they  produce
indigestion,  phlegm,  and  drool.  Sometimes  they  cause
scleroses or growths like wadding or like membranes.
These  ill  effects  are  too  many  to  mention  them  all.
Therefore those who are skilled at hygiene gather in their
feelings  and  return  to  essence—this  is  a  good  method  of
getting rid of disease.
Feelings are nature acting out externally. Sages nurture

do  not  conceive  love  on  account  of  it;  ugliness  is  the
ugliness  of  things,  so  they  do  not  conceive  hatred  on
account of it.
Thus it is said, “Open and impartial, when things come

unadulterated  with  the  subjectivity  of  human  desires.
Responding accordingly means that when there are things
that  must  be,  then  act  in  such  a  way  as  will  cause  no
problems in that context.

you cannot deliberately be responsive to events; when you
