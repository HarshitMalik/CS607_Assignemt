on the ground of eternal nonbeing it is necessary to focus
on essential nature.
When  you  are  focused  on  essential  nature,  there  has
never  been  any  thing;  self  is  forgotten  and  things
sublimate  spontaneously.  Even  though  things  fill  the
environment,  they  always  return  to  nonbeing.  Layman
Pang said, “Just have no mind on myriad things yourself—
why fear things always surrounding you?”
There  are  bewitching  people,  and  there  are  bewitching
things;  both  can  make  people  stray.  But  can  they  really
make  people  stray?  The  fact  is  that  people  stray  on  their
own. The Hundred Character Tablet says, “True constancy
should  deal  with  things;  in  dealing  with  things,  it  is
essential not to stray.” When you see beautiful things and
conceive  a  thought  of  liking  for  them,  your  mind  is  then
drawn away by them—thus you have strayed.
When you see through one thing, you are not confused
by one thing; when you see through myriad things, you are
not confused by myriad things. The Diamond Sutra  says,
“All  compounded  things  are  like  dreams,  illusions,
bubbles,  shadows;  they  are  like  dew  and  like  lightning—
you should practice this observation.”
Everything in the world has its own proper principle, in
respect  to  which  subjective  ideas  are  useless.  So  what  in
the world is there to cogitate about or worry about? This is
why cultivated  people  take  care  of  matters  as  they  occur,
without making anything the matter. They deal with things
as they are, without sticking to things.
