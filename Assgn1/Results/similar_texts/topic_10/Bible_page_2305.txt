  2306    John 21 
23  Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that 
disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not 
 
die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? 
   
24  ¶ This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote 
these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 
 
25  ¶ And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, 
if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world 
itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
