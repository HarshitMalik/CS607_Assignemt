  18    Genesis 8 
13  In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and 
Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of 
his sons with them, into the ark; 
 
14  they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their 
kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after 
his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
15  And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, 
wherein is the breath of life. 
16  And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God 
had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in. 
 
17  ¶ And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters 
 
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. 
18  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the 
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
 
19  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the 
 
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 
20  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains 
 
were covered. 
21  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of 
cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon 
the earth, and every man: 
 
22  all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry 
land, died. 
23  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face 
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and 
the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: 
   
and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the 
ark. 
24  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.

1  And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the 
cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass 
 
over the earth, and the waters assuaged.
