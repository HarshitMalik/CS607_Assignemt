Parents  are  the  heaven  and  earth  of  a  home;  filial
children are attentive to their parents as they are attentive
to  heaven  and  earth.  When  their  parents  treat  them
lovingly,  they  are  joyful  and  do  not  forget;  when  their
parents treat them badly, they are hurt but not resentful.
Heaven  and  earth  are  the  parents  of  all  beings.  People
should  be  as  attentive  to  heaven  and  earth  as  to  their
parents. When rich and successful, they manage it without
excess; when poor and in difficulty, they accept it without
losing their uprightness.
It  may  be  asked  how  we  can  exercise  familial  duty
toward our parents after they are dead. The answer is that
the  bodies  of  the  children  are  the  relics  of  the  parents;  if
we take care of ourselves without fail, this is how we serve
our parents.
Our  human  nature  is  a  boon  from  heaven  and  earth;  if
we nurture it well and do not lose it, this is how we serve
heaven and earth.
VIRTUE
In the present age, those who attain the Way are rare. It is
not that the Way is hard to attain; it is because people do
not yet know it truly or do not keep to it firmly.
The practice of internalizing virtue begins with making
intention sincere. The practice of cultivating virtue begins
with taking to goodness.
