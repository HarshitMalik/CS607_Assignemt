  168    Exodus 19 
20  and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show 
them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they 
must do. 
21  Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as 
fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over 
 
them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of 
fifties, and rulers of tens: 
 
22  and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that 
 
every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small 
matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they 
 
shall bear the burden with thee. 
23  If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou 
shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their 
place in peace. 
24  Â¶ So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all 
that he had said. 
25  And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads 
over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of 
fifties, and rulers of tens. 
26  And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they 
 
brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged 
themselves. 
27  And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into 
 
his own land.

Israel at Mount Sinai 
1  In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out 
of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of 
Sinai. 
2  For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the 
desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel 
 
camped before the mount.
