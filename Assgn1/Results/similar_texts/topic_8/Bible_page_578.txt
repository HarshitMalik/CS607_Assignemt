  579    Judges 9 
28  And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is 
Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? 
   
and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of 
 
Shechem: for why should we serve him? 
   
29  And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I 
 
remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, 
and come out. 
30  ¶ And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the 
son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
31  And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, 
Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, 
 
behold, they fortify the city against thee. 
32  Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, 
and lie in wait in the field: 
 
33  and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou 
shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the 
 
people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do 
to them as thou shalt find occasion. 
34  ¶ And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by 
night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
35  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the 
gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were 
 
with him, from lying in wait. 
36  And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there 
come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said 
unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were 
men. 
37  And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the 
middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain 
of Meonenim. 
38  Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith 
thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not 
 
this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and 
 
fight with them.
