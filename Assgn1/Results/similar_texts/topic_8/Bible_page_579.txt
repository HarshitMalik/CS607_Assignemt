  580    Judges 9 
39  And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with 
Abimelech. 
40  And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many 
were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. 
41  And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and 
 
his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
42  ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into 
the field; and they told Abimelech. 
 
43  And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, 
and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were 
come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote 
 
them. 
44  And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed 
forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the 
 
two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, 
and slew them. 
45  And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the 
 
city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, 
and sowed it with salt. 
46  ¶ And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they 
entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith. 
47  And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of 
Shechem were gathered together. 
48  And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people 
that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut 
 
down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his 
shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye 
have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. 
49  And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and 
followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on 
fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died 
 
also, about a thousand men and women. 
50  ¶ Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, 
and took it.
