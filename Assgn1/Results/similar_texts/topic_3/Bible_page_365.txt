  366    Numbers 22 
19  Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may 
know what the Lord will say unto me more. 
20  And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men 
come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word 
 
which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
The Angel and Balaam’s Ass 
21  ¶ And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and 
went with the princes of Moab. 
22  And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the 
 
Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was 
riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. 
23  And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his 
sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, 
 
and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into 
 
the way. 
24  But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall 
being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
25  And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself 
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he 
 
smote her again. 
26  And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow 
place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the 
left. 
27  And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under 
Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with 
 
a staff. 
28  And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto 
Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me 
these three times? 
 
29  And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I 
 
would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
