  1564    Isaiah 41 
41 
God’s Assurance to Israel 
1  Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their 
 
strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near 
     
together to judgment. 
2  Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his 
foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? 
 
he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his 
bow. 
3  He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not 
 
gone with his feet. 
4  Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the 
beginning? I the Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he. 
   
5  ¶ The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, 
 
drew near, and came. 
6  They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his 
 
brother, Be of good courage. 
7  So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth 
with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for 
the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be 
 
moved. 
8  ¶ But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the 
seed of Abraham my friend.  
9  Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee 
from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my 
servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. 
 
10  Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy 
     
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold 
     
thee with the right hand of my righteousness. 
11  ¶ Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed 
and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with 
   
thee shall perish.
