THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
Prajaapatistwam prapitaamahashcha;
Namo namaste’stu sahasrakritwah
Punashcha bhooyo’pi namo namaste.
39. Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the moon, the creator, and the great-grandfather.
Salutations, salutations unto Thee, a thousand times, and again salutations, salutations unto Thee!
Namah purastaadatha prishthataste
Namo’stu te sarvata eva sarva;
Anantaveeryaamitavikramastwam
Sarvam samaapnoshi tato’si sarvah.
40. Salutations to Thee from front and from behind! Salutations to Thee on every side! O
All! Thou infinite in power and prowess, pervadest all; wherefore Thou art all.
Sakheti matwaa prasabham yaduktam
He krishna he yaadava he sakheti;
Ajaanataa mahimaanam tavedam
Mayaa pramaadaat pranayena vaapi.
41. Whatever I have presumptuously uttered from love or carelessness, addressing Thee as
O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding Thee merely as a friend, unknowing of this, Thy
greatness,
Yachchaavahaasaartham asatkrito’si
Vihaarashayyaasanabhojaneshu;
Eko’thavaapyachyuta tatsamaksham
Tatkshaamaye twaamaham aprameyam.
42. In whatever way I may have insulted Thee for the sake of fun while at play, reposing,
sitting or at meals, when alone (with Thee), O Achyuta, or in company—that I implore Thee,
immeasurable one, to forgive!
Pitaasi lokasya charaacharasya
Twamasya poojyashcha gururgareeyaan;
Na twatsamo’styabhyadhikah kuto’nyo
Lokatraye’pyapratimaprabhaava.
43. Thou art the Father of this world, unmoving and moving. Thou art to be adored by this
world. Thou art the greatest Guru; (for) none there exists who is equal to Thee; how then can there
be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unequalled power?
Tasmaatpranamya pranidhaaya kaayam
Prasaadaye twaamahameeshameedyam;
Piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuh
Priyah priyaayaarhasi deva sodhum.
