THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
19. I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of endless arms, the sun
and the moon being Thy eyes, the burning fire Thy mouth, heating the entire universe with Thy
radiance.
Dyaavaaprithivyoridamantaram hi
Vyaaptam twayaikena dishashcha sarvaah;
Drishtwaa’dbhutam roopamugram tavedam
Lokatrayam pravyathitam mahaatman.
20. The space between the earth and the heaven and all the quarters are filled by Thee alone;
having seen this, Thy wonderful and terrible form, the three worlds are trembling with fear, O
great-souled Being!
Amee hi twaam surasanghaah vishanti
Kechid bheetaah praanjalayo grinanti;
Swasteetyuktwaa maharshisiddhasanghaah
Stuvanti twaam stutibhih pushkalaabhih.
21. Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of gods; some extol Thee in fear with joined palms:
“May it be well.” Saying thus, bands of great sages and perfected ones praise Thee with complete
hymns.
Rudraadityaa vasavo ye cha saadhyaa
Vishwe’shvinau marutashchoshmapaashcha;
Gandharvayakshaasurasiddhasanghaa
Veekshante twaam vismitaashchaiva sarve.
22. The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Visvedevas, the two Asvins, Maruts, the manes
and hosts of celestial singers, Yakshas, demons and the perfected ones, are all looking at Thee in
great astonishment.
Roopam mahat te bahuvaktranetram
Mahaabaaho bahubaahoorupaadam;
Bahoodaram bahudamshtraakaraalam
Drishtwaa lokaah pravyathitaastathaa’ham.
23. Having beheld Thy immeasurable form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed,
with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs, and fearful with many teeth, the worlds are
terrified and so am I!
Nabhahsprisham deeptamanekavarnam
Vyaattaananam deeptavishaalanetram;
Drishtwaa hi twaam pravyathitaantaraatmaa
Dhritim na vindaami shamam cha vishno.
