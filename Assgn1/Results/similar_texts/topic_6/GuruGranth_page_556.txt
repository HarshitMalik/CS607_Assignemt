Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
RAAG WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:   
To the addict, there is nothing like the drug; to the fish, there is nothing else like water. 
Those who are attuned to their Lord — everyone is pleasing to them.  || 1 ||   I am a 
sacrifice, cut apart into pieces, a sacrifice to Your Name, O Lord and Master.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   The Lord is the fruitful tree; His Name is ambrosial nectar. Those who drink 
it in are satisfied; I am a sacrifice to them.  || 2 ||   You are not visible to me, although 
You dwell with everyone. How can the thirst of the thirsty be quenched, with that wall 
between me and the pond?  || 3 ||   Nanak is Your merchant; You, O Lord and Master, 
are my capital. My mind is cleared of doubt, when I praise You in prayer.  || 4 || 1 ||   
WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL:  The virtuous bride ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord; 
why  does  the  unworthy  one  cry  out? If she were to become  virtuous, then  she too 
could enjoy her Husband Lord.  || 1 ||   My Husband Lord is loving and playful; why 
should the soul-bride enjoy any other?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   If the soul-bride does good 
deeds,  and  makes  her  mind  the  thread,  she  obtains  the  jewel,  which  cannot  be 
purchased for any price, strung upon the thread of her consciousness.  || 2 ||   I ask, 
but I do not follow the way shown to me; still, I claim to have reached my destination. I 
do not speak with You, O my Husband Lord; how then can I come to have a place in 
Your home?  || 3 ||   O Nanak, without the One, there is no other at all. If the soul-
bride remains attached to You, then she shall enjoy her Husband Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   
WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:  The peacocks are singing sweetly, O 
sister; the rainy season of Saawan has come. Your beauteous eyes are like a string of 
charms, fascinating and enticing the soul-bride. I would cut myself into pieces for the 
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; I am a sacrifice to Your Name. I take pride in You; 
without You, what could I be proud of? So smash your bracelets along with your bed, O 
soul-bride, and break your arms, along with the arms of your couch.
