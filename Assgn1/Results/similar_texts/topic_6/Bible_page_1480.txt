  1481    Song of Solomon 2 
The Bride and the Bridegroom 
9  I have compared thee, O my love, 
to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots. 
10  Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, 
thy neck with chains of gold. 
11  We will make thee borders of gold 
with studs of silver. 
12  While the King sitteth at his table, 
my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. 
13  A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; 
 
he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. 
14  My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire 
in the vineyards of Engedi. 
15  Behold, thou art fair, my love; 
 
behold, thou art fair; 
 
thou hast doves’ eyes. 
16  Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: 
 
also our bed is green. 
17  The beams of our house are cedar, 
and our rafters of fir. 
2 
1  I am the rose of Sharon, 
and the lily of the valleys. 
2  As the lily among thorns, 
so is my love among the daughters. 
3  As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, 
so is my beloved among the sons. 
I sat down under his shadow with great delight, 
and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 
4  He brought me to the banqueting house, 
and his banner over me was love. 
5  Stay me with flagons,
