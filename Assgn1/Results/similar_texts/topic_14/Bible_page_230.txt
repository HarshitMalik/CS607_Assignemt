  231    Leviticus 3 
3 
Peace Offerings 
1  And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of 
the herd, whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without 
blemish before the Lord. 
2  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it 
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons 
 
the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
3  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering 
made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and 
 
all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
4  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the 
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he 
take away. 
5  And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, 
which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by 
 
fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
6  ¶ And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord 
be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 
7  If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the 
Lord. 
8  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it 
before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons shall 
 
sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. 
9  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering 
made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it 
 
shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the 
 
inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
10  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the 
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he 
take away. 
11  And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the 
 
offering made by fire unto the Lord.
