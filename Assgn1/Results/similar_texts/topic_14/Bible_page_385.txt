29  ¶ And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen 
lambs of the first year without blemish: 
 
30  and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, 
for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, 
after the manner: 
 
31  and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, 
 
his meat offering, and his drink offering. 
32  ¶ And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen

his meat offering, and his drink offering. 
35  ¶ On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no 
 
servile work therein: 
 
36  but ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a 
sweet savor unto the Lord: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of 
 
the first year without blemish: 
 
37  their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the 
ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the 
manner: 
 
38  and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, 
 
and his meat offering, and his drink offering. 
39  ¶ These things ye shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts, beside 
your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, 
and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for 
your peace offerings.
