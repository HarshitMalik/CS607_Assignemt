  2342    Acts 13 
23  And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave 
not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the 
 
ghost. 
24  ¶ But the word of God grew and multiplied. 
25  ¶ And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had 
fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname 
was Mark.

Barnabas and Saul Begin Their First Missionary Journey 
1  Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets 
and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and 
 
Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with 
Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
2  As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, 
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have 
called them. 
3  And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on 
them, they sent them away. 
The Apostles Preach in Cyprus 
4  ¶ So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto 
Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
 
5  And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in 
the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their 
 
minister. 
6  And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found 
a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus: 
 
7  which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a 
prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to 
 
hear the word of God.
