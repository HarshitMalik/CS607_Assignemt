  1426    Proverbs 14 
23  Much food is in the tillage of the poor: 
 
but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. 
24  He that spareth his rod hateth his son: 
 
but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. 
25  The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: 
 
but the belly of the wicked shall want. 
14 
1  Every wise woman buildeth her house: 
 
but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. 
2  He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord: 
 
but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 
3  In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: 
 
but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 
4  Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: 
 
but much increase is by the strength of the ox. 
5  A faithful witness will not lie: 
 
but a false witness will utter lies. 
6  A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: 
 
but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. 
7  Go from the presence of a foolish man, 
when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. 
8  The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: 
 
but the folly of fools is deceit. 
9  Fools make a mock at sin: 
 
but among the righteous there is favor. 
10  The heart knoweth his own bitterness; 
 
and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. 
11  The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: 
 
but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. 
12  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; 
 
but the end thereof are the ways of death.  
13  Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; 
 
and the end of that mirth is heaviness.
