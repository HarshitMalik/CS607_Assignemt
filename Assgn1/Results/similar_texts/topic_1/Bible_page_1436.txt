  1437    Proverbs 20 
and the simple will beware: 
 
and reprove one that hath understanding, 
and he will understand knowledge. 
26  He that wasteth his father, 
and chaseth away his mother, 
is a son that causeth shame, 
and bringeth reproach. 
27  Cease, my son, to hear the instruction 
that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. 
28  An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: 
 
and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 
29  Judgments are prepared for scorners, 
and stripes for the back of fools. 
20 
1  Wine is a mocker, 
strong drink is raging: 
 
and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. 
2  The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: 
 
whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. 
3  It is an honor for a man to cease from strife: 
 
but every fool will be meddling. 
4  The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; 
 
therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. 
5  Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; 
 
but a man of understanding will draw it out. 
6  Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: 
 
but a faithful man who can find? 
 
7  The just man walketh in his integrity: 
 
his children are blessed after him. 
8  A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment 
scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 
9  Who can say, I have made my heart clean, 
I am pure from my sin?
