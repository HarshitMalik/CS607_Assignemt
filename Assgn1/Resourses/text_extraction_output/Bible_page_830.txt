  831    1 Kings 22 
44  And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
45  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he 
showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the 
Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
46  And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of 
his father Asa, he took out of the land. 
47  ¶ There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 
 
48  Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but 
 
they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
 
49  Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my 
servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would 
not. 
50  And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned 
 
in his stead. 
The Reign of Ahaziah of Israel 
51  ¶ Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the 
seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two 
years over Israel. 
52  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of 
his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
 
53  for he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the 
Lord God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
