  56    Genesis 25 
67  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took 
Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was 
   
comforted after his mother’s death.

Abraham’s Descendants through Keturah 
1  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
2  And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, 
and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
3  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were 
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
4  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and 
 
Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
5  And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
6  But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, 
Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while 
he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
The Death and Burial of Abraham 
7  ¶ And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he 
lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
8  Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old 
man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 
 
9  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of 
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, 
which is before Mamre; 
 
10  the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was 
 
Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
11  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed 
his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
