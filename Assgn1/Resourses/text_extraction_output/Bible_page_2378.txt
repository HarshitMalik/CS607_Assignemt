  2379    Acts 25 
14  And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s 
cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by 
Felix: 
 
15  about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the 
elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against 
him. 
16  To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver 
any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers 
face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the 
crime laid against him. 
17  Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the 
morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be 
brought forth. 
18  Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none 
accusation of such things as I supposed: 
 
19  but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, 
and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 
20  And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him 
whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these 
matters. 
21  But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of 
Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to 
Caesar. 
22  Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. 
Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. 
23  ¶ And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with 
great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the 
chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ 
commandment Paul was brought forth. 
24  And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present 
with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews 
have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he 
ought not to live any longer.
