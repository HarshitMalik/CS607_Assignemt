  1720    Jeremiah 48 
24  and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the 
land of Moab, far or near. 
25  The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord. 
26  ¶ Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against the 
 
Lord: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in 
 
derision. 
27  For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among 
 
thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. 
 
28  O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and 
be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s 
mouth. 
29  We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud,) his 
loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of 
his heart. 
30  I know his wrath, saith the Lord; but it shall not be so; his lies shall 
   
not so effect it. 
31  Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; 
 
mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres. 
32  O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: 
 
thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: 
 
the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. 
33  And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the 
land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: 
   
none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting. 
 
34  From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, 
have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as a 
heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be 
 
desolate. 
35  Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the Lord, him that 
offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his 
gods. 
36  Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine 
heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the 
 
riches that he hath gotten are perished.
