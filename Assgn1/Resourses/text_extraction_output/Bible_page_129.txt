  130    Exodus 3 
14  And God said unto Moses, I am that I am: and he said, Thus 
 
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto 
you. 
15  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the 
children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of 
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me 
unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all 
 
generations. 
16  Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The 
Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 
Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen 
that which is done to you in Egypt: 
 
17  and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt 
unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the 
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, 
unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
18  And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and 
 
the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto 
him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let 
 
us go, we beseech thee, three daysâ€™ journey into the wilderness, that 
we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. 
19  And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by 
a mighty hand. 
20  And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my 
wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will 
 
let you go. 
21  And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it 
 
shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
 
22  but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that 
sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and 
raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your 
 
daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
