  1449    Proverbs 26 
and as vinegar upon nitre, 
so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart. 
21  If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; 
 
and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: 
 
22  for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,  
and the Lord shall reward thee. 
23  The north wind driveth away rain: 
 
so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 
24  It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, 
than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 
25  As cold waters to a thirsty soul, 
so is good news from a far country. 
26  A righteous man falling down before the wicked 
is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 
27  It is not good to eat much honey: 
 
so for men to search their own glory is not glory. 
28  He that hath no rule over his own spirit 
is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. 
26 
1  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, 
so honor is not seemly for a fool. 
2  As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, 
so the curse causeless shall not come. 
3  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, 
and a rod for the foolâ€™s back. 
4  Answer not a fool according to his folly, 
lest thou also be like unto him. 
5  Answer a fool according to his folly, 
lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
6  He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool 
cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. 
7  The legs of the lame are not equal: 
 
so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
