  1265    Psalms 50 
12  If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: 
 
for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. 
13  Will I eat the flesh of bulls, 
or drink the blood of goats? 
 
14  Offer unto God thanksgiving; 
 
and pay thy vows unto the Most High: 
 
15  and call upon me in the day of trouble: 
 
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. 
16  But unto the wicked God saith, 
What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, 
or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 
 
17  seeing thou hatest instruction, 
and castest my words behind thee. 
18  When thou sawest a thief, 
then thou consentedst with him, 
and hast been partaker with adulterers. 
19  Thou givest thy mouth to evil, 
and thy tongue frameth deceit. 
20  Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; 
 
thou slanderest thine own motherâ€™s son. 
21  These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; 
 
thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: 
 
but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. 
22  Now consider this, ye that forget God, 
lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. 
23  Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: 
 
and to him that ordereth his conversation aright 
will I show the salvation of God.
