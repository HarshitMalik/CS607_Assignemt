  2589    1 Peter 3 
Suffer for Righteousness’ Sake 
8  ¶ Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; 
 
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 
 
9  not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise 
 
blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should 
 
inherit a blessing. 
10  For he that will love life, 
and see good days, 
let him refrain his tongue from evil, 
and his lips that they speak no guile: 
 
11  let him eschew evil, and do good; 
 
let him seek peace, and ensue it. 
12  For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, 
and his ears are open unto their prayers: 
 
but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.  
13  ¶ And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which 
is good? 
 
14  But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not 
 
afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; 
 
15  but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give 
 
an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is 
in you, with meekness and fear: 
 
16  having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as 
 
of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good 
conversation in Christ. 
17  For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, 
than for evildoing. 
18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, 
that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but 
quickened by the Spirit: 
 
19  by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 
 
20  which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of 
God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, 
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
