  1491    Song of Solomon 8 
until he please. 
Love Is Strong as Death 
5  Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, 
leaning upon her beloved? 
 
I raised thee up under the apple tree: 
 
there thy mother brought thee forth; 
 
there she brought thee forth that bare thee. 
6  Set me as a seal upon thine heart, 
as a seal upon thine arm: 
 
for love is strong as death; 
 
jealousy is cruel as the grave: 
 
the coals thereof are coals of fire, 
which hath a most vehement flame. 
7  Many waters cannot quench love, 
neither can the floods drown it: 
 
if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, 
it would utterly be contemned. 
8  We have a little sister, 
and she hath no breasts: 
 
what shall we do for our sister 
in the day when she shall be spoken for? 
 
9  If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: 
 
and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. 
10  I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: 
 
then was I in his eyes as one that found favor. 
11  Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; 
 
he let out the vineyard unto keepers; 
 
every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of 
silver. 
12  My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: 
 
thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, 
and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. 
13  Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
