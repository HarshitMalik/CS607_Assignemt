  2051    Matthew 15 
25  And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, 
walking on the sea. 
26  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were 
troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
 
27  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it 
 
is I; be not afraid. 
 
28  ¶ And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me 
come unto thee on the water. 
29  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the 
ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 
30  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning 
 
to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 
31  And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, 
and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou 
doubt? 
 
32  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 
33  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, 
Of a truth thou art the Son of God. 
Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret 
34  ¶ And when they were gone over, they came into the land of 
Gennesaret. 
35  And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent 
out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all 
that were diseased; 
 
36  and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his 
garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
