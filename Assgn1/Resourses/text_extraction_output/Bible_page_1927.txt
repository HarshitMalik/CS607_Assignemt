  1928    Joel 3 
recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense 
upon your own head; 
 
5  because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into 
your temples my goodly pleasant things: 
 
6  the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye 
sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their 
border. 
7  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold 
them, and will return your recompense upon your own head: 
 
8  and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the 
children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a 
people far off: for the Lord hath spoken it. 
 
9  ¶ Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the 
 
mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: 
   
10  beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into 
spears: let the weak say, I am strong. 
 
11  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather 
yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to 
 
come down, O Lord. 
12  Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of 
Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round 
 
about. 
13  Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for 
   
the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great. 
 
14  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the 
 
Lord is near in the valley of decision. 
15  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall 
withdraw their shining. 
The Deliverance of Judah 
16  ¶ The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from 
Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the 
   
Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the 
children of Israel.
