  457    Deuteronomy 21 
16  But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give 
thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that 
breatheth: 
 
17  but thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the 
 
Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the 
Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee: 
   
18  that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which 
they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the Lord 
 
your God. 
19  ¶ When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against 
it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an 
axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not 
 
cut them down (for the tree of the field is man’s life) to employ them 
in the siege: 
 
20  only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, 
thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build 
 
bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be 
subdued.

Settlement for an Unknown Murderer’s Crime 
1  If one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy God giveth 
thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath 
slain him: 
 
2  then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall 
measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 
 
3  and it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even 
the elders of that city shall take a heifer, which hath not been 
wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
 
4  and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough 
valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the 
heifer’s neck there in the valley.
