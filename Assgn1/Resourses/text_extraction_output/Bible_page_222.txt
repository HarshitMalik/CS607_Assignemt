  223    Exodus 39 
25  And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the 
pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the 
pomegranates; 
 
26  a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about 
the hem of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses. 
27  ¶ And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and 
for his sons, 
28  and a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and 
linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
29  and a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, 
of needlework; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
30  ¶ And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and 
wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, 
Holiness to the Lord. 
31  And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the 
mitre; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
The Tabernacle Articles Completed 
32  ¶ Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the 
congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to 
 
all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they. 
33  And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his 
furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his 
sockets; 
 
34  and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of 
badgers’ skins, and the veil of the covering; 
 
35  the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat; 
 
36  the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the showbread; 
 
37  the pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to 
be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light; 
 
38  and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, 
and the hanging for the tabernacle door;
