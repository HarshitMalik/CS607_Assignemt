  795    1 Kings 11 
25  And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides 
the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned 
 
over Syria. 
26  ¶ And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, 
Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow 
woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. 
27  And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: 
 
Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David 
his father. 
28  And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon 
 
seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler 
over all the charge of the house of Joseph. 
29  And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of 
Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the 
way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two 
   
were alone in the field: 
 
30  and Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in 
twelve pieces: 
 
31  and he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the 
 
Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the 
hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: 
 
32  (but he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for 
Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of 
Israel:) 
 
33  because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped 
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the 
Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have 
not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to 
keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father. 
34  Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I 
 
will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s 
sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my 
statutes: 
 
35  but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it 
unto thee, even ten tribes.
