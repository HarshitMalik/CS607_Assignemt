  2070    Matthew 21 
30  And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered 
and said, I go, sir; and went not. 
 
31  Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto 
 
him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That 
the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before 
you. 
32  For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye 
believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: 
   
and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might 
believe him. 
The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen 
33  Â¶ Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which 
 
planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a 
winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, 
and went into a far country: 
 
34  and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to 
the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 
35  And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed 
another, and stoned another. 
36  Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto 
 
them likewise. 
37  But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will 
reverence my son. 
38  But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among 
themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize 
 
on his inheritance. 
39  And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew 
him. 
40  When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do 
unto those husbandmen? 
 
41  They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, 
and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall 
render him the fruits in their seasons.
