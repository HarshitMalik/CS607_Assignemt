  1808    Ezekiel 25 
21  Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I 
 
will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the 
desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons 
 
and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. 
22  And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat 
 
the bread of men. 
23  And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your 
feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your 
   
iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 
24  Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done 
 
shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord 
 
God. 
25  Â¶ Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from 
them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, 
and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their 
daughters, 
26  that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee 
to hear it with thine ears? 
 
27  In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and 
thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign 
 
unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

The Prophecy against the Ammonites 
1  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy 
against them; 
 
3  and say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord God; 
 
Thus saith the Lord God; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my 
 
sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, 
 
when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they 
 
went into captivity;
