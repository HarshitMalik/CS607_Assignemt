  2174    Luke 7 
The House Built on a Rock 
46  ¶ And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I 
say? 
 
47  Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth 
them, I will show you to whom he is like: 
 
48  he is like a man which built a house, and digged deep, and laid the 
foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat 
 
vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it; for it was 
 
founded upon a rock. 
49  But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a 
foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream 
 
did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that 
 
house was great. 
7 
A Centurion’s Servant Healed 
1  Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the 
people, he entered into Capernaum. 
2  And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was 
sick, and ready to die. 
3  And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the 
Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
4  And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, 
That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
 
5  for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
6  Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from 
the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, 
Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest 
 
enter under my roof: 
 
7  wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but 
 
say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
