of Assur, which brought us up hither.  
3  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers 
of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a 
house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the 
 
Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath 
commanded us. 
4  ¶ Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of 
Judah, and troubled them in building,

of Persia. 
6  ¶ And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, 
wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah 
and Jerusalem. 
7  ¶ And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, 
Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of 
Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian 
 
tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. 
8  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter 
against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 
 
9  then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the 
rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the 
 
Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the 
Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,

brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are 
on this side the river, and at such a time.

Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, 
 
and at such a time.

to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad 
city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
