  1467    Ecclesiastes 4 
have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a 
 
beast: for all is vanity. 
 
20  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
 
21  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit 
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
 
22  Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man 
should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who 
   
shall bring him to see what shall be after him? 
 
4 
1  So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done 
under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and 
 
they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was 
 
power; but they had no comforter. 
 
2  Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more than 
the living which are yet alive. 
3  Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath 
not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 
4  ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this 
a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of 
spirit. 
5  ¶ The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
6  ¶ Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with 
travail and vexation of spirit. 
7  ¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
8  There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither 
 
child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his 
   
eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labor, and 
 
bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. 
 
9  ¶ Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for 
 
their labor. 
10  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is 
 
alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
