  1269    Psalms 54 
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  
4  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? 
 
who eat up my people as they eat bread: 
 
they have not called upon God. 
5  There were they in great fear, where no fear was: 
 
for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against 
thee: 
 
thou hast put them to shame, 
because God hath despised them. 
6  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! 
 
When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, 
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

A Prayer for Protection from Enemies 
To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil,  
A Psalm of David, when the Ziphim came and said to Saul, 
Doth not David hide himself with us?  
 
1  Save me, O God, by thy name, 
and judge me by thy strength. 
2  Hear my prayer, O God; 
 
give ear to the words of my mouth. 
3  For strangers are risen up against me, 
and oppressors seek after my soul: 
 
they have not set God before them. 
Selah. 
4  Behold, God is mine helper: 
 
the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 
5  He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: 
 
cut them off in thy truth. 
6  I will freely sacrifice unto thee: 
 
I will praise thy name, O Lord;
