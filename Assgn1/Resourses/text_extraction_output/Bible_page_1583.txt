  1584    Isaiah 51 
10  ¶ Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice 
of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him 
 
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. 
11  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with 
sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have 
 
kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in 
 
sorrow. 
51 
Words of Comfort to Zion 
1  Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the 
Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of 
 
the pit whence ye are digged. 
2  Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I 
 
called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. 
3  For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste 
 
places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert 
 
like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found 
 
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. 
4  ¶ Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my 
 
nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my 
 
judgment to rest for a light of the people. 
5  My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine 
 
arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on 
 
mine arm shall they trust. 
6  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: 
 
for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall 
wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like 
manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness 
 
shall not be abolished. 
7  ¶ Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in 
whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be 
 
ye afraid of their revilings.
