The Call of Philip and Nathanael 
43  Â¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth 
Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. 
44  Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
45  Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, 
of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of 
Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
46  And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out 
of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 
 
47  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an 
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
 
48  Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus 
 
answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when 
thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. 
49  Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of 
God; thou art the King of Israel. 
 
50  Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw 
thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things 
 
than these. 
51  And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye 
shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and 
descending upon the Son of man.

The Wedding at Cana 
1  And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the 
 
mother of Jesus was there: 
 
2  and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
3  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, 
They have no wine. 
4  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine 
 
hour is not yet come.
