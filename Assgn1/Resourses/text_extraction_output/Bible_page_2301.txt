  2302    John 20 
10  Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 
Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene 
11  ¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she 
 
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 
12  and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the 
other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
13  And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto 
 
them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not 
where they have laid him. 
14  And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus 
standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
15  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest 
 
thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if 
 
thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I 
will take him away. 
16  Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, 
Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 
 
17  Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my 
 
Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my 
 
Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 
 
18  Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the 
Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 
Jesus Appears to His Disciples 
19  ¶ Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, 
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for 
fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto 
them, Peace be unto you. 
20  And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his 
side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. 
21  Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath 
 
sent me, even so send I you.
