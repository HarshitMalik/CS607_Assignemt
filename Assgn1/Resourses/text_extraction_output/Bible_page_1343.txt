  1344    Psalms 106 
and keep his laws. 
Praise ye the Lord. 
106 
The Rebelliousness of Israel 
1  Praise ye the Lord. 
O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: 
   
for his mercy endureth for ever.  
2  Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? 
 
Who can show forth all his praise? 
 
3  Blessed are they that keep judgment, 
and he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
4  Remember me, O Lord, 
with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people: 
 
O visit me with thy salvation; 
 
5  that I may see the good of thy chosen, 
that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, 
that I may glory with thine inheritance. 
6  We have sinned with our fathers, 
we have committed iniquity, 
we have done wickedly. 
7  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; 
 
they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; 
 
but provoked him at the sea, 
even at the Red sea.  
8  Nevertheless he saved them for his nameâ€™s sake, 
that he might make his mighty power to be known. 
9  He rebuked the Red sea also, 
and it was dried up: 
 
so he led them through the depths, 
as through the wilderness. 
10  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, 
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
