  741    2 Samuel 19 
22  And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, 
that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man 
 
be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this 
 
day king over Israel? 
 
23  Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the 
king sware unto him. 
24  ¶ And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, 
and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor 
washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he 
came again in peace. 
25  And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the 
king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou 
with me, Mephibosheth? 
 
26  And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for 
 
thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, 
and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. 
 
27  And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my 
 
lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in 
 
thine eyes. 
28  For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the 
king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at 
 
thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more 
unto the king? 
 
29  And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy 
matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
 
30  And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, 
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own 
house. 
31  ¶ And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went 
over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
32  Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he 
 
had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for 
 
he was a very great man. 
33  And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I 
will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
