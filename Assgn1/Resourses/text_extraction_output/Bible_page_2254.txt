  2255    John 5 
20  For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that 
himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that 
 
ye may marvel. 
21  For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so 
 
the Son quickeneth whom he will. 
22  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment 
unto the Son: 
 
23  that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. 
He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which hath 
sent him. 
24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and 
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not 
come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 
 
25  ¶ Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, 
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that 
 
hear shall live. 
26  For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to 
 
have life in himself; 
 
27  and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he 
is the Son of man. 
28  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are 
 
in the graves shall hear his voice, 
29  and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the 
 
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the 
 
resurrection of damnation.

30  ¶ I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my 
   
judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of 
 
the Father which hath sent me. 
31  If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
32  There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the 
 
witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
33  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
