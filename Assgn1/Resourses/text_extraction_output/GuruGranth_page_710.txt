RAAG  TODEE,  CHAU-PADAS,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:   
Without the Lord, my mind cannot survive. If the Guru unites me with my Beloved Lord 
God, my breath of life, then I shall not have to face the wheel of reincarnation again in 
the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My heart is gripped by a yearning for my 
Lord  God,  and  with  my  eyes,  I  behold  my  Lord  God.  The  merciful  True  Guru  has 
implanted the Name of the Lord within me; this is the Path leading to my Lord God.  || 
1 ||   Through the Lord‟s Love, I have found the Naam, the Name of my Lord God, the 
Lord of the Universe, the Lord my God. The Lord seems so very sweet to my heart, 
mind and body; upon my face, upon my forehead, my good destiny is inscribed.  || 2 ||   
Those  whose  minds  are attached to greed and  corruption forget the Lord, the good 
Lord God. Those self-willed manmukhs are called foolish and ignorant; misfortune and 
bad  destiny  are  written  on  their  foreheads.    ||  3  ||      From  the  True  Guru,  I  have 
obtained a discriminating intellect; the Guru has revealed the spiritual wisdom of God. 
Servant  Nanak  has  obtained  the  Naam  from  the  Guru;  such  is  the  destiny  inscribed 
upon his forehead.  || 4 || 1 ||

NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU: 
The Saints do not know any other. They are carefree, ever in the Lord‟s Love; the Lord 
and Master is on their side.  ||  Pause  ||   Your canopy is so high, O Lord and Master; 
no one else has any power. Such is the immortal Lord and Master the devotees have 
found; the spiritually wise remain absorbed in His Love.  || 1 ||   Disease, sorrow, pain, 
old age and death do not even approach the humble servant of the Lord. They remain 
fearless, in the Love of the One Lord; O Nanak, they have surrendered their minds to 
the  Lord.    ||  2  ||  1  ||      TODEE,    FIFTH  MEHL:    Forgetting  the Lord, one  is ruined 
forever.
