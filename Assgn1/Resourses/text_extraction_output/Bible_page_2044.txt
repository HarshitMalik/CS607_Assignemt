  2045    Matthew 13 
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; 
 
and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: 
 
15  for this people’s heart is waxed gross, 
and their ears are dull of hearing, 
and their eyes they have closed; 
 
lest at any time they should see with their eyes, 
and hear with their ears, 
and should understand with their heart, 
and should be converted, and I should heal them.  
16  But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. 
 
17  For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men 
have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; 
 
and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.  
Jesus Explains the Parable of the Sower 
18  ¶ Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
19  When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and 
understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth 
away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received 
seed by the wayside. 
20  But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that 
heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 
 
21  yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when 
 
tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he 
is offended. 
22  He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the 
word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, 
 
choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
23  But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth 
the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and 
 
bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
