  1266    Psalms 51 
51 
A Prayer for Cleansing 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto 
him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. 
1  Have mercy upon me, O God, 
according to thy loving-kindness: 
 
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies 
blot out my transgressions. 
2  Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, 
and cleanse me from my sin. 
3  For I acknowledge my transgressions: 
 
and my sin is ever before me. 
4  Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, 
and done this evil in thy sight: 
 
that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, 
and be clear when thou judgest.  
5  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; 
 
and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
6  Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: 
 
and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
7  Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: 
 
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
8  Make me to hear joy and gladness; 
 
that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
9  Hide thy face from my sins, 
and blot out all mine iniquities. 
10  Create in me a clean heart, O God; 
 
and renew a right spirit within me. 
11  Cast me not away from thy presence; 
 
and take not thy Holy Spirit from me. 
12  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
