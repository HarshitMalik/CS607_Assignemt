and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, 
and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks. 
27  And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in 
Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing 
   
became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 
28  Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they 
lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness 
forty years in the days of Gideon. 
29  ¶ And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
30  And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for 
 
he had many wives. 
31  And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, 
whose name he called Abimelech. 
32  And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried 
in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
33  ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children 
of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made 
Baal-berith their god. 
34  And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, 
who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on 
every side: 
 
35  neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, 
Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto 
Israel.

The Reign of Abimelech 
1  And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his 
mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the 
family of the house of his mother’s father, saying, 
2  Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is 
better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are
