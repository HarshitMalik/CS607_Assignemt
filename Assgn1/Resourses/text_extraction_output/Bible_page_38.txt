  39    Genesis 18 
23  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the 
righteous with the wicked? 
 
24  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also 
 
destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are 
therein? 
 
25  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous 
with the wicked; and that the righteous should be as the wicked, 
 
that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
   
26  And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the 
city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 
27  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon 
me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: 
 
28  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou 
 
destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty 
 
and five, I will not destroy it. 
29  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there 
shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s 
sake. 
30  And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will 
speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, 
 
I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 
31  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the 
Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, 
 
I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake. 
32  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but 
this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will 
 
not destroy it for ten’s sake. 
33  And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing 
with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
