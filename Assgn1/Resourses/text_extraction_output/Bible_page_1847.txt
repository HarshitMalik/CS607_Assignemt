  1848    Ezekiel 40 
40  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north 
gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch 
 
of the gate, were two tables. 
41  Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the 
side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices. 
 
42  And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a 
cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit 
high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they 
 
slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
43  And within were hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about: and 
 
upon the tables was the flesh of the offering. 
44  ¶ And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in 
the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their 
 
prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate 
 
having the prospect toward the north. 
45  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the 
south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 
46  And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the 
priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of 
 
Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the Lord to 
minister unto him. 
47  So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred 
cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house. 
 
48  ¶ And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each 
post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that 
side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and 
 
three cubits on that side. 
49  The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven 
cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: 
   
and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on 
that side.
