Great peace and contentment come through the Guru‟s Word, and one‟s meditation is 
perfectly focused upon God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Please shower Your Mercy upon me, 
and permit me to ignore the great enticements of Maya, O Lord, Merciful to the meek. 
Give  me  Your  Name  —  chanting  it,  I  live;  please  bring  the  efforts  of  Your  slave  to 
fruition.    ||  1  ||      All  desires,  power,  pleasure,  joy  and  lasting  bliss,  are  found  by 
chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing the Kirtan of His Praises. That 
humble servant of the Lord, who has such karma pre-ordained by the Creator Lord, O 
Nanak — his efforts are brought to perfect fruition.  || 2 || 20 || 51 ||   DHANAASAREE,  
FIFTH MEHL:  The Supreme Lord God takes care of His humble servant. The slanderers 
are not allowed to stay; they are pulled out by their roots, like useless weeds.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master; no one can harm me. 
Whoever shows disrespect to the Lord‟s humble servant, is instantly reduced to ashes.  
|| 1 ||   The Creator Lord has become my protector; He has no end or limitation. O 
Nanak, God has protected and saved His slaves; He has driven out and destroyed the 
slanderers.  || 2 || 21 || 52 ||    
DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  NINTH HOUSE,  PARTAAL:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
O  Lord,  I  seek  the  Sanctuary  of Your feet; Lord of the Universe, Destroyer of pain, 
please  bless  Your  slave  with  Your  Name.  Be  Merciful,  God,  and  bless  me  with  Your 
Glance of Grace; take my arm and save me — pull me up out of this pit!  || Pause  ||   
He is blinded by sexual desire and anger, bound by Maya; his body and clothes are 
filled with countless sins. Without God, there is no other protector; help me to chant 
Your Name, Almighty Warrior, Sheltering Lord.  || 1 ||   Redeemer of sinners, Saving 
Grace of all beings and creatures, even those who recite the Vedas have not found Your 
limit.  God  is  the  ocean  of  virtue  and  peace,  the  source  of  jewels;  Nanak  sings  the 
Praises of the Lover of His devotees.  || 2 || 1 || 53 ||   DHANAASAREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  
Peace in this world, peace in the next world and peace forever, remembering Him in 
meditation. Chant forever the Name of the Lord of the Universe. The sins of past lives 
are erased, by joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; new life is infused 
into the dead.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In power, youth and Maya, the Lord is forgotten; this 
is the greatest tragedy — so say the spiritual sages. Hope and desire to sing the Kirtan 
of the Lord‟s Praises — this is the treasure of the most fortunate devotees.  || 1 ||   O 
Lord of Sanctuary, all-powerful, imperceptible and unfathomable — Your Name is the 
Purifier of sinners. The Inner-knower, the Lord and Master of Nanak is totally pervading 
and permeating everywhere; He is my Lord and Master.  || 2 || 2 || 54 ||

I bow in reverence to the Lord, I bow in reverence. I sing the Glorious Praises of the 
Lord, my King.  ||  Pause  ||   By great good fortune, one meets the Divine Guru.
