  1775    Ezekiel 13 
25  For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak 
 
shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, 
   
O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith 
the Lord God. 
26  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
27  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that 
he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times 
that are far off. 
28  Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There shall 
 
none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I 
have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God. 
13 
False Prophets Condemned 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, 
and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, 
Hear ye the word of the Lord; 
 
3  Thus saith the Lord God; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that 
 
follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! 
 
4  O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. 
5  Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for 
the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. 
6  They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord 
saith: and the Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others 
   
to hope that they would confirm the word. 
7  Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying 
divination, whereas ye say, The Lord saith it; albeit I have not 
 
spoken? 
 
8  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have spoken 
 
vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the 
Lord God.
