Wisdom and Folly Compared 
1  A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death 
 
than the day of one’s birth. 
2  It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house 
of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to 
   
his heart. 
3  Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the 
 
countenance the heart is made better. 
4  The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of 
 
fools is in the house of mirth. 
5  It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the 
song of fools. 
6  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the 
fool: this also is vanity. 
 
7  Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth 
 
the heart. 
8  Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the 
 
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 
9  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the 
 
bosom of fools. 
10  Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better 
than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. 
 
11  Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them 
 
that see the sun. 
12  For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense: but the excellency 
 
of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 
13  Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which 
 
he hath made crooked? 
 
14  ¶ In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity 
consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the 
 
end that man should find nothing after him.
