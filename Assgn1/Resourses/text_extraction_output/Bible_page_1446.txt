  1447    Proverbs 25 
and a good blessing shall come upon them. 
26  Every man shall kiss his lips 
that giveth a right answer. 
27  Prepare thy work without, 
and make it fit for thyself in the field; 
 
and afterward build thine house. 
28  Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause; 
 
and deceive not with thy lips. 
29  Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: 
 
I will render to the man according to his work. 
30  I went by the field of the slothful, 
and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 
 
31  and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, 
and nettles had covered the face thereof, 
and the stone wall thereof was broken down. 
32  Then I saw, and considered it well: 
 
I looked upon it, and received instruction. 
33  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, 
a little folding of the hands to sleep: 
 
34  so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth; 
 
and thy want as an armed man.

Comparisons and Moral Lessons 
1  These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah 
king of Judah copied out. 
2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: 
 
but the honor of kings is to search out a matter. 
3  The heaven for height, 
and the earth for depth, 
and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 
4  Take away the dross from the silver, 
and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
