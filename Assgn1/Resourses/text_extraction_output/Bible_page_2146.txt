  2147    Mark 15 
34  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, 
Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my 
 
God, why hast thou forsaken me?  
 
35  And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, 
he calleth Elijah. 
36  And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, 
and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah 
 
will come to take him down. 
37  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
38  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the 
bottom. 
39  And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that 
he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was 
the Son of God. 
40  ¶ There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was 
 
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of 
Joses, and Salome; 
 
41  who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered 
unto him; and many other women which came up with him unto 
 
Jerusalem. 
The Burial of Jesus 
42  ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the 
preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
43  Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, which also waited 
for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and 
craved the body of Jesus. 
44  And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling unto him 
 
the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
45  And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
46  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him 
in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a 
rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
