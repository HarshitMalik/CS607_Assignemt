The Fall of Jerusalem 
1  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, 
came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against 
Jerusalem, and they besieged it. 
2  And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the 
ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. 
3  And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the 
middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-
saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes 
of the king of Babylon. 
4  And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw 
them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of 
the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate 
betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. 
 
5  But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook 
Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, 
 
they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah 
in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 
6  Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah 
before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of 
 
Judah. 
7  Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, 
to carry him to Babylon. 
8  And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the 
people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. 
9  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive 
into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, 
and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people 
that remained. 
10  But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the 
people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them 
vineyards and fields at the same time.
