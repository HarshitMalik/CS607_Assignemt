  634    1 Samuel 8 
10  And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines 
drew near to battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a 
 
great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited 
them; and they were smitten before Israel. 
 
11  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the 
Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car. 
12  ¶ Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, 
and called the name of it Ebenezer [the stone of help], saying, 
Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. 
13  So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the 
coast of Israel: and the hand of the Lord was against the 
 
Philistines all the days of Samuel. 
14  And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were 
restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts 
 
thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And 
there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
15  ¶ And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
16  And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and 
Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. 
17  And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he 
 
judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the Lord.

second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. 
 
3  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, 
and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 
4  ¶ Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and 
came to Samuel unto Ramah,
