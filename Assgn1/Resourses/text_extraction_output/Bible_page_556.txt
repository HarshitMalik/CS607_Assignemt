  557    Judges 2 
3  Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; 
 
but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a 
snare unto you. 
4  And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord spake these words 
unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, 
and wept. 
5  And they called the name of that place Bochim [weepers]: and they 
 
sacrificed there unto the Lord. 
The Death of Joshua 
6  ¶ And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel 
went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
7  And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the 
days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great 
works of the Lord, that he did for Israel. 
8  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a 
hundred and ten years old. 
9  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-
heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill 
Gaash. 
10  And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and 
 
there arose another generation after them, which knew not the 
Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 
Israel’s Apostasy and the Ministry of the Judges 
11  ¶ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and 
served Baalim: 
 
12  and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought 
them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods 
of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves 
unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger. 
13  And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
