  1469    Ecclesiastes 5 
The Vanity of Life 
8  ¶ If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of 
judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he 
 
that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than 
 
they. 
9  Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served 
 
by the field. 
10  ¶ He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that 
 
loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. 
 
11  ¶ When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what 
 
good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them 
with their eyes? 
 
12  ¶ The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or 
much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 
 
13  ¶ There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches 
kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
14  But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and 
 
there is nothing in his hand. 
15  As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go 
as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry 
away in his hand. 
16  And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he 
go: and what profit hath he that hath labored for the wind? 
   
17  All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow 
and wrath with his sickness. 
18  ¶ Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat 
 
and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh 
under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is 
 
his portion. 
19  Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and 
hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to 
rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God. 
 
20  For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God 
 
answereth him in the joy of his heart.
