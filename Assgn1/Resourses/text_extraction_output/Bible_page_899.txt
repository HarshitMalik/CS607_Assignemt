  900    2 Kings 25 
7  And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the 
eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried 
him to Babylon.  
The Captivity of Judah 
8  ¶ And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which 
is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, 
came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of 
Babylon, unto Jerusalem: 
 
9  and he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all 
the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with 
fire. 
10  And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the 
guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
11  Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the 
fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of 
the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry 
away. 
12  But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be 
vinedressers and husbandmen. 
13  ¶ And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and 
the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, did 
the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to 
Babylon. 
14  And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, 
and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they 
away.  
15  And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in 
gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. 
16  The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made 
for the house of the Lord; the brass of all these vessels was without 
 
weight. 
17  The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter 
upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and
