  1342    Psalms 105 
11  saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, 
the lot of your inheritance.  
12  When they were but a few men in number; 
 
yea, very few, and strangers in it; 
 
13  when they went from one nation to another, 
from one kingdom to another people; 
 
14  he suffered no man to do them wrong: 
 
yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
 
15  saying, Touch not mine anointed, 
and do my prophets no harm.  
16  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: 
 
he brake the whole staff of bread.  
17  He sent a man before them, 
even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:  
 
18  whose feet they hurt with fetters: 
 
he was laid in iron: 
 
19  until the time that his word came: 
 
the word of the Lord tried him.  
20  The king sent and loosed him; 
 
even the ruler of the people, 
and let him go free.  
21  He made him lord of his house, 
and ruler of all his substance:  
 
22  to bind his princes at his pleasure; 
 
and teach his senators wisdom. 
23  Israel also came into Egypt;  
 
and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.  
24  And he increased his people greatly; 
 
and made them stronger than their enemies. 
25  He turned their heart to hate his people, 
to deal subtilely with his servants.  
26  He sent Moses his servant; 
 
and Aaron whom he had chosen.  
27  They showed his signs among them, 
and wonders in the land of Ham.
