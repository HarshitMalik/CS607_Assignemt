  1146    Job 11 
and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
13  And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: 
 
I know that this is with thee. 
14  If I sin, then thou markest me, 
and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 
15  If I be wicked, woe unto me; 
 
and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. 
I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 
   
16  for it increaseth. 
Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: 
 
and again thou showest thyself marvelous upon me. 
17  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine 
indignation upon me; 
 
changes and war are against me. 
18  Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? 
 
Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 
 
19  I should have been as though I had not been; 
 
I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 
20  Are not my days few? Cease then, 
 
and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 
21  before I go whence I shall not return, 
even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
 
22  a land of darkness, as darkness itself; 
 
and of the shadow of death, without any order, 
and where the light is as darkness.

Zophar Accuses Job of Iniquity 
1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
2  Should not the multitude of words be answered? 
 
And should a man full of talk be justified? 
 
3  Should thy lies make men hold their peace? 
 
And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
