  1108    Nehemiah 13 
The Provision for the Priests and Levites 
44  ¶ And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the 
treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to 
gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the 
law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and 
 
for the Levites that waited. 
45  And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, 
and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment 
of David, and of Solomon his son. 
46  For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the 
singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
47  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of 
Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every 
day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; 
   
and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.

Nehemiah’s Reforms 
1  On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the 
people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the 
 
Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 
 
2  because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with 
water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: 
 
howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.  
3  Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they 
separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. 
4  ¶ And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the 
chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: 
 
5  and he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they 
laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the 
tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was
