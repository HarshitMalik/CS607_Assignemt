  950    1 Chronicles 20 
18  But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians 
 
seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand 
footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
19  And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the 
worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his 
servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon 
 
any more.

David Captures Rabbah 
1  And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that 
kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and 
wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and 
besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote 
Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
2  And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and 
found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in 
it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding 
   
much spoil out of the city. 
3  And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with 
saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David 
with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the 
people returned to Jerusalem. 
The Giants Slain by David’s Men 
4  ¶ And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with 
the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew 
 
Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. 
 
5  And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son 
 
of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear 
staff was like a weaver’s beam.
