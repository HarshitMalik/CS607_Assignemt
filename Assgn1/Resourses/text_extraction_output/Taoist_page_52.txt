People who study the Way first must recognize reality and
unreality  before  they  can  enter  the  Way.  We  have  seen
actors  portraying  failure  and  success,  gain  and  loss,
parting and meeting, sadness and happiness; their outward
forms  are  as  they  appear,  while  their  minds  are  inwardly
calm.  What  have  they  attained  that  they  are  able  to  be
unmoved  in  mind  like  this?  They  are  clearly  aware  that
these  representations,  the  costumery  and  the  makeup,  the
states  of  mind  and  the  life  situations,  are  artificially
created—they switch and shift roles without loss or gain to
themselves.  Learners  can  understand  the  Way  by
contemplating this.
Also  look  at  marionettes—their  hands  and  feet  move,
vaguely like human forms. People who do not know may
look at the puppets, see the strings, and still not think that
there  must  be  someone  holding  up  the  strings  before  the
puppet can move. If that person should suddenly leave, the
marionette  strings  would  still  be  there  but  they  would  be
immobile.  The  physical  body  of  a  human  being  is  like  a
marionette;  its  energy  and  blood  are  the  strings,  and  the
real nature or essence is the puppeteer.
Also  look  at  the  sleight-of-hand  artist;  he  changes
names and shifts objects to confuse the eyes and minds of
onlookers,  who  declare  it  marvelous.  All  worldly
contrivances  involve  mental  deception  and  illusion,  no
different  from  sleight  of  hand—if  you  can  see  them
without your eyes being dazzled and your mind confused,
then you are near the Way.
