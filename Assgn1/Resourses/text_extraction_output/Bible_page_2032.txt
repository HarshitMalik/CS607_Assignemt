  2033    Matthew 9 
20  And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood 
twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his 
garment: 
 
21  for she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall 
be whole. 
22  But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, 
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. 
 
And the woman was made whole from that hour. 
23  And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels 
and the people making a noise, 
24  he said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but 
 
sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 
25  But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by 
the hand, and the maid arose. 
26  And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. 
Two Blind Men Receive Sight 
27  ¶ And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, 
crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us. 
28  And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: 
 
and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? 
 
They said unto him, Yea, Lord. 
29  Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it 
unto you. 
30  And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, 
 
saying, See that no man know it. 
31  But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all 
that country. 
A Dumb Man Speaks 
32  ¶ As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man 
possessed with a devil.
