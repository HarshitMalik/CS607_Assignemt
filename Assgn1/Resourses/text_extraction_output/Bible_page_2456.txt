  2457    2 Corinthians 1 
10  who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom 
 
we trust that he will yet deliver us; 
 
11  ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed 
upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by 
many on our behalf. 
The Postponement of Paul’s Visit 
12  ¶ For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in 
simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the 
grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more 
abundantly to you-ward. 
13  For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or 
acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 
   
14  as also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, 
even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
15  ¶ And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, 
that ye might have a second benefit; 
 
16  and to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of 
Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward 
Judea. 
17  When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the 
 
things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with 
me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay? 
 
18  But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. 
19  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by 
us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but 
in him was yea. 
20  For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto 
the glory of God by us. 
21  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed 
us, is God; 
 
22  who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our 
hearts.
