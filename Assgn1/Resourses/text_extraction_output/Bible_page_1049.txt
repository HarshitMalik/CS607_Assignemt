  1050    2 Chronicles 35 
17  And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at 
that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  
18  And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days 
of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such 
 
a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all 
Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem. 
19  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept. 
The Death of Josiah 
20  Â¶ After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king 
of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and 
 
Josiah went out against him. 
21  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with 
thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but 
 
against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me 
 
to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with 
 
me, that he destroy thee not. 
22  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but 
disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not 
unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight 
in the valley of Megiddo. 
23  And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his 
 
servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. 
 
24  His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in 
the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, 
 
and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. 
And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
25  And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the 
 
singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, 
and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are 
 
written in the lamentations. 
26  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to 
that which was written in the law of the Lord,
