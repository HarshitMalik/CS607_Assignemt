  249    Leviticus 11 
remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and eat it 
without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy. 
 
13  And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy 
sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am 
 
commanded.  
14  And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean 
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be 
   
thy due, and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of 
peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
15  The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the 
offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering 
before the Lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a 
 
statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.  
 
16  ¶ And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, 
behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, 
 
the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 
17  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, 
seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity 
of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the 
Lord? 
 
18  Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye 
 
should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. 
19  And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered 
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and 
 
such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering 
 
today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord? 
 
20  And when Moses heard that, he was content.

Clean and Unclean Animals 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts 
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
