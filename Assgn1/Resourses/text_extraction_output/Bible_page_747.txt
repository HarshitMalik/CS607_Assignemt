  748    2 Samuel 22 
22 
Davidâ€™s Song of Deliverance 
1  And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song, in the day 
that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, 
and out of the hand of Saul: 
 
2  and he said, 
The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 
 
3  the God of my rock; in him will I trust: 
   
he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and 
my refuge, 
my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 
 
4  I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: 
 
so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 
5  When the waves of death compassed me, 
the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; 
 
6  the sorrows of hell compassed me about; 
 
the snares of death prevented me. 
7  In my distress I called upon the Lord, 
and cried to my God: 
 
and he did hear my voice out of his temple, 
and my cry did enter into his ears. 
8  Then the earth shook and trembled; 
 
the foundations of heaven moved 
and shook, because he was wroth. 
9  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, 
and fire out of his mouth devoured: 
 
coals were kindled by it. 
10  He bowed the heavens also, and came down; 
 
and darkness was under his feet. 
11  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: 
 
and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. 
12  And he made darkness pavilions round about him, 
dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
