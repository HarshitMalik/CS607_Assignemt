The Birth of Samuel 
1  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount 
Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of 
Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 
 
2  and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the 
 
name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but 
 
Hannah had no children. 
3  ¶ And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to 
sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, 
Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there. 
4  And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah 
his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
 
5  but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: 
   
but the Lord had shut up her womb. 
6  And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, 
because the Lord had shut up her womb. 
7  And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the 
Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. 
 
8  Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest 
thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am 
     
not I better to thee than ten sons? 
 
9  ¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they 
had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the 
temple of the Lord. 
10  And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and 
wept sore. 
11  And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt 
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
