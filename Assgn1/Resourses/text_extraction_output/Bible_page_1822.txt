the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go 
down to the pit. 
15  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; In the day when he went down to the 
 
grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I 
 
restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and 
 
I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field 
fainted for him. 
16  I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him 
down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees 
 
of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall 
be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
17  They also went down into hell with him, unto them that be slain 
with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his 
 
shadow in the midst of the heathen. 
18  To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the 
trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of 
 
Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst 
 
of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. 
¶ This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God. 
32 
1  And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the 
first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, 
saying, 
2  Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and 
say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou 
art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, 
 
and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. 
3  Thus saith the Lord God; I will therefore spread out my net over 
 
thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up 
 
in my net. 
4  Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the 
open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain 
upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
