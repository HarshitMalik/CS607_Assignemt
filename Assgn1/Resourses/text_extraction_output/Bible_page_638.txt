  639    1 Samuel 10 
10 
1  Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and 
kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee 
to be captain over his inheritance? 
 
2  When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two 
men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and 
 
they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are 
found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and 
 
sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 
 
3  Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to 
the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to 
God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three 
loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 
 
4  and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which 
 
thou shalt receive of their hands. 
5  After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison 
of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come 
 
thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets 
coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and 
a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 
   
6  and the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt 
prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
7  And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as 
occasion serve thee; for God is with thee. 
 
8  And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will 
 
come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice 
sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come 
 
to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do. 
9  ¶ And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from 
Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to 
 
pass that day. 
10  And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of 
prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he 
 
prophesied among them.
