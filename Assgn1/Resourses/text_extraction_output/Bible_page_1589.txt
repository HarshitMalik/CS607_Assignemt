  1590    Isaiah 55 
11  Â¶ O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, 
I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with 
sapphires. 
12  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, 
and all thy borders of pleasant stones.  
13  And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be 
 
the peace of thy children. 
14  In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from 
 
oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not 
     
come near thee. 
15  Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever 
 
shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. 
16  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, 
and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have 
 
created the waster to destroy. 
17  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every 
 
tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. 
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their 
righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.

A Free Offer of Mercy to All 
1  Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that 
hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and 
   
milk without money and without price. 
2  Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your 
 
labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and 
 
eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. 
3  Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; 
   
and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure 
mercies of David.  
4  Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and 
commander to the people.
