  407    Deuteronomy 1 
The Appointment of Judges 
9  ¶ And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear 
you myself alone: 
 
10  the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this 
day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
11  (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so 
many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 
 
12  How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, 
and your strife? 
 
13  Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your 
tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. 
14  And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is 
good for us to do. 
15  So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made 
them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over 
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and 
officers among your tribes. 
16  And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes 
between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man 
and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. 
17  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small 
 
as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the 
   
judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it 
 
unto me, and I will hear it. 
18  And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should 
do. 
The Spies Sent Out at Kadesh-barnea 
19  ¶ And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that 
great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the 
mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; 
 
and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
