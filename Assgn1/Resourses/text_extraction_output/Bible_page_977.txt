the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the 
other cherub. 
12  And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the 
wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to 
 
the wing of the other cherub. 
13  The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty 
cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.  
 
14  And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine 
linen, and wrought cherubim thereon. 
The Two Pillars 
15  Â¶ Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits 
high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five 
cubits. 
16  And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of 
the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the 
 
chains. 
17  And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right 
hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the 
 
right hand Jachin [he shall establish], and the name of that on the 
left Boaz [in it is strength].

The Furnishings for the Temple 
1  Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length 
thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the 
height thereof. 
2  Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round 
in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty 
 
cubits did compass it round about.
