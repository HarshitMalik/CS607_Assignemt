  381    Numbers 28 
the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no 
shepherd. 
18  And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a 
man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 
 
19  and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the 
congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 
 
20  And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the 
congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 
21  And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel 
for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: at his word 
 
shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and 
all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. 
22  And Moses did as the Lord commanded him: and he took Joshua, 
 
and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the 
congregation: 
 
23  and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the 
Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.

The Daily Offerings 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, 
and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savor unto 
me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. 
3  And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire 
which ye shall offer unto the Lord; two lambs of the first year 
 
without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering. 
4  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb 
shalt thou offer at even; 
 
5  and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled 
with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. 
6  It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai 
for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.
