  1766    Ezekiel 8 
2  Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the 
 
appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins 
 
even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of 
amber.  
3  And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine 
head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, 
 
and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of 
the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of 
 
the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. 
4  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to 
the vision that I saw in the plain.  
5  ¶ Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way 
toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the 
north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of 
jealousy in the entry. 
6  He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they 
do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel 
 
committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but 
 
turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations. 
7  ¶ And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, 
 
behold a hole in the wall. 
8  Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I 
 
had digged in the wall, behold a door. 
9  And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations 
that they do here. 
10  So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, 
 
and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, 
portrayed upon the wall round about. 
11  And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the 
house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of 
Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud 
 
of incense went up. 
12  Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the 
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the
