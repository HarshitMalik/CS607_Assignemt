  2106    Mark 4 
13  And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then 
 
will ye know all parables? 
 
14  The sower soweth the word. 
15  And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but 
 
when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away 
the word that was sown in their hearts. 
16  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, 
 
when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with 
gladness; 
 
17  and have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: 
 
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s 
sake, immediately they are offended. 
18  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the 
 
word, 
19  and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the 
lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh 
unfruitful. 
20  And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear 
 
the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, 
some sixty, and some a hundred. 
A Candle under a Bushel 
21  ¶ And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a 
bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?  
   
22  For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither 
 
was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.  
23  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
24  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear. With what 
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto you that 
 
hear shall more be given. 
25  For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from 
 
him shall be taken even that which he hath.
