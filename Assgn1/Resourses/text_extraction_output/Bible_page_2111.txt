  2112    Mark 6 
The Mission of the Twelve 
7  ¶ And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth 
by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 
   
8  and commanded them that they should take nothing for their 
journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their 
 
purse: 
 
9  but be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. 
 
10  And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into a house, 
there abide till ye depart from that place. 
11  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart 
thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against 
them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom 
and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.  
12  And they went out, and preached that men should repent. 
13  And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that 
were sick, and healed them.  
The Death of John the Baptist 
14  ¶ And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad;) 
   
and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and 
therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him. 
15  Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, 
or as one of the prophets.  
16  But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I 
beheaded: he is risen from the dead. 
 
17  For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and 
bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife; 
 
for he had married her. 
18  For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy 
brother’s wife.  
19  Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have 
killed him; but she could not:
