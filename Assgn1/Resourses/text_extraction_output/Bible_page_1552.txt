  1553    Isaiah 36 
36 
The Invasion of Sennacherib 
1  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that 
Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defensed cities 
of Judah, and took them. 
2  And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem 
unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit 
of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field. 
3  Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over 
the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the 
recorder. 
4  ¶ And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus 
saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this 
wherein thou trustest? 
 
5  I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and 
strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest 
 
against me? 
 
6  Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon 
 
if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh 
 
king of Egypt to all that trust in him. 
7  But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he, 
 
whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and 
said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? 
 
8  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of 
Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on 
thy part to set riders upon them. 
9  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of 
my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and 
for horsemen? 
 
10  And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to 
destroy it? the Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and 
 
destroy it.
