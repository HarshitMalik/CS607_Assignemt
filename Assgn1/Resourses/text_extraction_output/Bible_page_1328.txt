  1329    Psalms 95 
Or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
 
17  Unless the Lord had been my help, 
my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
18  When I said, My foot slippeth; 
 
thy mercy, O Lord, held me up. 
19  In the multitude of my thoughts within me 
thy comforts delight my soul. 
20  Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, 
which frameth mischief by a law? 
 
21  They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, 
and condemn the innocent blood. 
22  But the Lord is my defense; 
 
and my God is the rock of my refuge. 
23  And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, 
and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; 
 
yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off.

A Song of Praise and Worship 
1  O come, let us sing unto the Lord: 
 
let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
2  Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, 
and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 
3  For the Lord is a great God, 
and a great King above all gods. 
4  In his hand are the deep places of the earth: 
 
the strength of the hills is his also. 
5  The sea is his, and he made it: 
 
and his hands formed the dry land. 
6  O come, let us worship and bow down: 
 
let us kneel before the Lord our maker. 
7  For he is our God; 
 
and we are the people of his pasture,
