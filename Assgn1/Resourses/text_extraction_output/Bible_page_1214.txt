  1215    Psalms 15 
6  Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, 
because the Lord is his refuge. 
7  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! 
 
When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, 
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

The Inhabitants of Godâ€™s Holy Hill 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? 
 
Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
 
2  He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, 
and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
3  He that backbiteth not with his tongue, 
nor doeth evil to his neighbor, 
nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. 
4  In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; 
 
but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. 
He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 
5  He that putteth not out his money to usury, 
nor taketh reward against the innocent. 
He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
