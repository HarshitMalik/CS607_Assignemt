  1521    Isaiah 17 
14  But now the Lord hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the 
years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with 
all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and 
 
feeble.

The Oracle concerning Damascus 
1  The burden of Damascus.  
¶ Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a 
ruinous heap. 
2  The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall 
 
lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 
3  The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from 
Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of 
 
the children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts. 
The Judgment on Israel 
4  ¶ And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall 
be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. 
5  And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and 
reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth 
 
ears in the valley of Rephaim. 
6  Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, 
two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five 
in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the Lord God of 
Israel. 
7  ¶ At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have 
respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
8  And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither 
shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or 
the images.
