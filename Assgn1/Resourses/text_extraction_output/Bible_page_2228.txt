The Plot against Jesus 
1  Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the 
passover.  
2  And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; 
 
for they feared the people. 
3  ¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the 
number of the twelve. 
4  And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and 
captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
5  And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
6  And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them 
in the absence of the multitude. 
Jesus Eats the Passover with His Disciples 
7  ¶ Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must 
be killed. 
8  And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, 
that we may eat. 
9  And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
 
10  And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, 
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him 
 
into the house where he entereth in. 
11  And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith 
unto thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the 
passover with my disciples? 
 
12  And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make 
 
ready. 
13  And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they 
 
made ready the passover. 
14  ¶ And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve 
apostles with him.
