Joel 
[Joel] 
1 
The Devastation of the Land by Locusts 
1  The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. 
2  ¶ Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. 
Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
 
3  Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, 
and their children another generation. 
4  That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and 
 
that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and 
 
that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. 
5  ¶ Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of 
 
wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. 
 
6  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without 
number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek 
teeth of a great lion. 
7  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made 
 
it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. 
 
8  ¶ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her 
youth. 
9  The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house 
of the Lord; the priests, the Lord’s ministers, mourn. 
 
10  The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the 
   
new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 
11  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the 
 
wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is 
 
perished. 
12  The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate 
 
tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the 
field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of 
 
men.
