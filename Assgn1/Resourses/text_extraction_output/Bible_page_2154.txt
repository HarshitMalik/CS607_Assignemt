  2155    Luke 2 
in the house of his servant David; 
 
70  as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, 
which have been since the world began: 
 
71  that we should be saved from our enemies, 
and from the hand of all that hate us; 
 
72  to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, 
and to remember his holy covenant; 
 
73  the oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 
74  that he would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the 
hand of our enemies, 
might serve him without fear, 
75  in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. 
76  And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: 
 
for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  
 
77  to give knowledge of salvation unto his people 
by the remission of their sins, 
78  through the tender mercy of our God; 
 
whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, 
79  to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of 
death, 
to guide our feet into the way of peace. 
80  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the 
deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.

1  And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from 
Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 
2  (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of 
Syria.) 
3  And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
