  1262    Psalms 49 
in the city of our God: 
 
God will establish it for ever. 
Selah. 
9  We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God, 
in the midst of thy temple. 
10  According to thy name, O God, 
so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: 
 
thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
11  Let mount Zion rejoice, 
let the daughters of Judah be glad, 
because of thy judgments. 
12  Walk about Zion, and go round about her: 
 
tell the towers thereof. 
13  Mark ye well her bulwarks, 
consider her palaces; 
 
that ye may tell it to the generation following. 
14  For this God is our God for ever and ever: 
 
he will be our guide even unto death.

The Folly of Trusting in Riches 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
1  Hear this, all ye people; 
 
give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 
 
2  both low and high, 
rich and poor, together. 
3  My mouth shall speak of wisdom; 
 
and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 
4  I will incline mine ear to a parable: 
 
I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 
5  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
