  1441    Proverbs 22 
29  A wicked man hardeneth his face: 
 
but as for the upright, he directeth his way. 
30  There is no wisdom nor understanding 
nor counsel against the Lord. 
31  The horse is prepared against the day of battle: 
 
but safety is of the Lord. 
22 
1  A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, 
and loving favor rather than silver and gold. 
2  The rich and poor meet together: 
 
the Lord is the maker of them all. 
3  A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: 
 
but the simple pass on, and are punished. 
4  By humility and the fear of the Lord 
are riches, and honor, and life. 
5  Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: 
 
he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. 
6  Train up a child in the way he should go: 
 
and when he is old, he will not depart from it. 
7  The rich ruleth over the poor, 
and the borrower is servant to the lender. 
8  He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: 
 
and the rod of his anger shall fail. 
9  He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; 
 
for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 
10  Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; 
 
yea, strife and reproach shall cease. 
11  He that loveth pureness of heart, 
for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. 
12  The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge; 
 
and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. 
13  The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, 
I shall be slain in the streets.
