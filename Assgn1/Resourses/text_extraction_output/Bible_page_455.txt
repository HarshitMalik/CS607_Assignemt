  456    Deuteronomy 20 
4  for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you 
against your enemies, to save you. 
5  And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is 
there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him 
 
go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another 
man dedicate it. 
6  And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet 
eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in 
 
the battle, and another man eat of it. 
7  And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not 
taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the 
 
battle, and another man take her. 
8  And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall 
say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go 
 
and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as 
his heart. 
9  And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking 
unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead 
the people. 
10  ¶ When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then 
proclaim peace unto it. 
11  And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, 
then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be 
tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. 
12  And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against 
thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 
 
13  and when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, 
thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: 
 
14  but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in 
the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and 
 
thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God 
hath given thee. 
15  Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from 
thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
