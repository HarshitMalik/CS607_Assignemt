  370    Numbers 24 
23  Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, 
neither is there any divination against Israel: 
 
according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, 
What hath God wrought! 
 
24  Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, 
and lift up himself as a young lion: 
 
he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, 
and drink the blood of the slain. 
25  Â¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless 
them at all. 
26  But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, 
All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do? 
 
27  And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee 
unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou 
 
mayest curse me them from thence. 
28  And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh 
toward Jeshimon. 
29  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and 
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
30  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram 
on every altar.

1  And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he 
went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his 
face toward the wilderness. 
2  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents 
according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him. 
 
3  And he took up his parable, and said, 
Balaam the son of Beor hath said, 
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
 
4  he hath said, which heard the words of God, 
which saw the vision of the Almighty, 
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
