A Prayer for the Destruction of the Deceitful 
To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Give ear to my prayer, O God; 
 
and hide not thyself from my supplication.

because of the oppression of the wicked: 
 
for they cast iniquity upon me, 
and in wrath they hate me. 
4  My heart is sore pained within me: 
 
and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 
5  Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, 
and horror hath overwhelmed me. 
6  And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! 
 
For then would I fly away, and be at rest. 
7  Lo, then would I wander far off, 
and remain in the wilderness. 
Selah. 
8  I would hasten my escape 
from the windy storm and tempest. 
9  Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: 
 
for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 
10  Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:

11  Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
