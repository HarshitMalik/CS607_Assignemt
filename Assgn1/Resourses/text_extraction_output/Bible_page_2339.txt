James Killed and Peter Imprisoned 
1  Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to 
vex certain of the church. 
2  And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
3  And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to 
take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 
4  And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and 
delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; 
 
intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. 
5  Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without 
 
ceasing of the church unto God for him. 
Peter Delivered from Prison 
6  Â¶ And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night 
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: 
 
and the keepers before the door kept the prison. 
7  And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light 
shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised 
 
him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his 
hands. 
8  And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. 
And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about 
thee, and follow me. 
9  And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true 
 
which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. 
 
10  When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto 
the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of 
 
his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one 
 
street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. 
 
11  And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a 
surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out
