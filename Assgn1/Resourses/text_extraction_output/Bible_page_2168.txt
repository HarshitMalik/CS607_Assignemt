  2169    Luke 5 
The Call of Levi 
27  ¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named 
Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow 
 
me. 
28  And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 
29  ¶ And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was 
 
a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with 
them. 
30  But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, 
saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?  
 
31  And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not 
a physician; but they that are sick. 
 
32  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 
The Question about Fasting 
33  ¶ And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, 
and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but 
 
thine eat and drink? 
 
34  And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the 
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 
 
35  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away 
from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 
36  And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a 
 
new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh 
 
a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with 
the old. 
37  And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine 
 
will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. 
38  But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are 
 
preserved. 
39  No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for 
 
he saith, The old is better.
