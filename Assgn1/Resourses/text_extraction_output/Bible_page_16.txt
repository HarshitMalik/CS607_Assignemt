  17    Genesis 7 
21  And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt 
gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 
 
22  Thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him, so did 
he.

The Flood 
1  And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into 
the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 
 
2  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and 
his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his 
 
female. 
3  Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep 
 
seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 
4  For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty 
days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made 
 
will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 
5  And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him. 
6  ¶ And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters 
was upon the earth. 
7  And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives 
with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 
8  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of 
every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
9  there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and 
the female, as God had commanded Noah. 
10  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood 
were upon the earth. 
11  ¶ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the 
seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains 
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were 
opened.  
12  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
