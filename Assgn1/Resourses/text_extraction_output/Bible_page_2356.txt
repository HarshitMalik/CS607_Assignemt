  2357    Acts 17 
21  (For all the Athenians, and strangers which were there, spent their 
time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.) 
22  ¶ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill [or, the court of the 
Areopagites], and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all 
things ye are too superstitious. 
23  For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions [or, gods that ye 
worship], I found an altar with this inscription, To the 
unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him 
declare I unto you. 
24  God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is 
Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with 
hands; 
 
25  neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any 
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  
 
26  and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all 
the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before 
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
 
27  that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, 
and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
 
28  for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of 
 
your own poets have said, 
For we are also his offspring. 
29  Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to 
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven 
by art and man’s device. 
30  And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now 
 
commandeth all men every where to repent: 
 
31  because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the 
world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; 
 
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised 
him from the dead. 
32  ¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some 
mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. 
 
33  So Paul departed from among them.
