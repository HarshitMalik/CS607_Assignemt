  2044    Matthew 13 
13 
The Parable of the Sower 
1  The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. 
2  And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he 
went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the 
 
shore. 
3  And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a 
sower went forth to sow; 
 
4  and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls 
came and devoured them up: 
 
5  some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and 
 
forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
 
6  and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they 
 
had no root, they withered away. 
7  And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and 
 
choked them: 
 
8  but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a 
hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. 
9  Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
The Purpose of the Parables 
10  Â¶ And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou 
unto them in parables? 
 
11  He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to 
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not 
given. 
12  For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more 
abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away 
 
even that he hath.  
13  Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; 
   
and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 
14  And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,
