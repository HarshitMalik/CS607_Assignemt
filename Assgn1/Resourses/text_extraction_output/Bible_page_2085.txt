  2086    Matthew 26 
28  for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many 
for the remission of sins. 
29  But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the 
vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s 
kingdom. 
Peter’s Denial Foretold 
30  ¶ And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount 
of Olives. 
31  Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me 
this night: for it is written, 
 
I will smite the shepherd, 
and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  
32  But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  
33  Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be 
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. 
34  Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before 
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
35  Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not 
deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 
Jesus Prays in Gethsemane 
36  ¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, 
and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
37  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and 
began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 
38  Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even 
unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 
 
39  And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, 
saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: 
 
nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 
40  And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and 
saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
