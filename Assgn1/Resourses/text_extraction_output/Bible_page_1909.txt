  1910    Hosea 5 
15  ¶ Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and 
 
come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, 
The Lord liveth. 
16  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the Lord will 
 
feed them as a lamb in a large place. 
17  ¶ Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone. 
 
18  Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: 
   
her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. 
19  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be 
ashamed because of their sacrifices. 
5 
The Punishment for Israel’s Apostasy 
1  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye 
   
ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye 
 
have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
2  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have 
been a rebuker of them all. 
3  ¶ I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O 
 
Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled. 
4  They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the 
 
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not 
known the Lord. 
5  ¶ And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall 
 
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with 
 
them. 
6  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
Lord; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself 
   
from them. 
7  They have dealt treacherously against the Lord; for they have 
 
begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with 
 
their portions.
