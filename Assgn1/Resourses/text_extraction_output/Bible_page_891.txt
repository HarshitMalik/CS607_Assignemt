  892    2 Kings 22 
13  Go ye, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all 
Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is 
 
the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our 
fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do 
according unto all that which is written concerning us. 
14  Â¶ So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, 
and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of 
Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the 
wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they 
   
communed with her. 
15  And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell 
the man that sent you to me, 
16  Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and 
upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which 
the king of Judah hath read: 
 
17  because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto 
other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works 
of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this 
 
place, and shall not be quenched. 
18  But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the Lord, 
thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As 
touching the words which thou hast heard; 
 
19  because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself 
before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this 
place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become 
a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before 
me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord. 
 
20  Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt 
be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all 
 
the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the 
king word again.
