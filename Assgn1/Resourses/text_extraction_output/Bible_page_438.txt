  439    Deuteronomy 12 
13  Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every 
place that thou seest: 
 
14  but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, 
there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do 
all that I command thee. 
15  ¶ Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, 
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the 
Lord thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean 
 
may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. 
16  Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as 
 
water. 
17  Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy 
wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor 
any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or 
heave offering of thine hand: 
 
18  but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place 
which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy 
daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the 
Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the 
 
Lord thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto. 
19  Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou 
livest upon the earth. 
20  ¶ When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath 
promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul 
longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul 
 
lusteth after. 
21  If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his name 
there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of 
thy flock, which the Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded 
thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth 
after. 
22  Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: 
 
the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike. 
23  Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; 
   
and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
