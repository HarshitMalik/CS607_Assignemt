  554    Judges 1 
10  And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: now 
 
the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba: and they slew 
 
Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 
Othniel Conquers Debir and Receives Achsah 
11  ¶ And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and 
 
the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher: 
 
12  and Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to 
him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
13  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: 
 
and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
14  And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to 
ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb 
   
said unto her, What wilt thou? 
 
15  And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a 
 
south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the 
 
upper springs and the nether springs. 
The Extent of the Conquests of Judah and Benjamin 
16  ¶ And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out 
of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the 
wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they 
 
went and dwelt among the people. 
17  And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the 
Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And 
the name of the city was called Hormah. 
18  Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the 
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 
19  And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of 
 
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, 
 
because they had chariots of iron. 
20  And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled 
 
thence the three sons of Anak.
