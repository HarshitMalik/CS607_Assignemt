  1547    Isaiah 32 
2  And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert 
from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of 
 
a great rock in a weary land. 
3  And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them 
that hear shall hearken. 
4  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the 
tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. 
5  The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to 
be bountiful. 
6  For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work 
iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, 
to make empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink 
 
of the thirsty to fail. 
7  The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked 
 
devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy 
speaketh right. 
8  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he 
 
stand. 
Women of Jerusalem Warned 
9  Â¶ Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless 
 
daughters; give ear unto my speech. 
 
10  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for 
 
the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. 
11  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: 
   
strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins. 
12  They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the 
fruitful vine. 
13  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, 
 
upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: 
 
14  because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall 
 
be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild 
 
asses, a pasture of flocks;
