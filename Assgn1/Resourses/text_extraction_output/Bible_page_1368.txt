  1369    Psalms 119 
110  The wicked have laid a snare for me: 
 
yet I erred not from thy precepts. 
111  Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever: 
 
for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 
112  I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes 
always, even unto the end. 
samech 
113  I hate vain thoughts: 
 
but thy law do I love. 
114  Thou art my hiding place and my shield: 
 
I hope in thy word. 
115  Depart from me, ye evildoers: 
 
for I will keep the commandments of my God. 
116  Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: 
 
and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 
117  Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: 
 
and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. 
118  Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: 
 
for their deceit is falsehood. 
119  Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: 
 
therefore I love thy testimonies. 
120  My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; 
 
and I am afraid of thy judgments. 
ain 
121  I have done judgment and justice: 
 
leave me not to mine oppressors. 
122  Be surety for thy servant for good: 
 
let not the proud oppress me. 
123  Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, 
and for the word of thy righteousness. 
124  Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, 
and teach me thy statutes. 
125  I am thy servant; give me understanding, 
 
that I may know thy testimonies. 
126  It is time for thee, Lord, to work:
