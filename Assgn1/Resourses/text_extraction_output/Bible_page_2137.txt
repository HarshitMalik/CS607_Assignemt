  2138    Mark 13 
21  And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is 
 
there; believe him not: 
   
22  for false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs 
and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. 
23  But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. 
 
The Coming of the Son of Man 
24  ¶ But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be 
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 
25  and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven 
shall be shaken. 
26  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with 
great power and glory. 
27  And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his 
elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to 
the uttermost part of heaven. 
28  ¶ Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When her branch is yet 
 
tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 
 
29  so ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, 
know that it is nigh, even at the doors. 
30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all 
these things be done. 
31  Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass 
 
away. 
32  ¶ But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels 
which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.  
33  Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
 
34  For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his 
house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his 
work, and commanded the porter to watch.  
35  Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house 
 
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the 
morning: 
 
36  lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
