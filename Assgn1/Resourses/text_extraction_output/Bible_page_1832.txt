  1833    Ezekiel 36 
9  I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not 
return: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
 
10  Â¶ Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two 
countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Lord 
 
was there: 
 
11  therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will even do according to 
thine anger, and according to thine envy, which thou hast used out 
of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among 
 
them, when I have judged thee. 
12  And thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all 
thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of 
Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 
13  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have 
multiplied your words against me: I have heard them. 
 
14  Thus saith the Lord God; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will 
 
make thee desolate. 
15  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, 
because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be 
 
desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall 
 
know that I am the Lord.

The Future Restoration of Israel 
1  Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and 
say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: 
 
2  Thus saith the Lord God; Because the enemy hath said against you, 
 
Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession: 
 
3  therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because they 
 
have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that 
ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are 
taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: 
 
4  therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God; 
 
Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills, to the
