  2109    Mark 5 
10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out 
of the country. 
11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine 
feeding. 
12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, 
that we may enter into them. 
13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went 
out, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a 
 
steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand,) and were 
choked in the sea. 
14  ¶ And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the 
country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 
15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the 
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right 
mind; and they were afraid. 
 
16  And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was 
possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. 
17  And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 
18  And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed 
with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 
19  Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to 
thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for 
thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 
20  And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great 
things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel. 
 
Jairus’ Daughter and the Woman Who Touched Jesus’ Garment 
21  ¶ And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other 
side, much people gathered unto him; and he was nigh unto the 
 
sea. 
22  And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, 
Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
