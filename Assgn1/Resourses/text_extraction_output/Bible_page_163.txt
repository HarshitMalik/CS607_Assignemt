  164    Exodus 17 
26  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the 
 
sabbath, in it there shall be none. 
27  And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the 
seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 
28  And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my 
commandments and my laws? 
 
29  See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he 
giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every 
 
man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
30  So the people rested on the seventh day. 
31  Â¶ And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it 
 
was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers 
 
made with honey.  
32  And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, 
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see 
 
the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I 
brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 
33  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of 
manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your 
generations. 
34  As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the 
Testimony, to be kept. 
35  And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they 
came to a land inhabited: they did eat manna, until they came unto 
 
the borders of the land of Canaan.  
36  Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

Water from the Rock 
1  And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from 
the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the 
commandment of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there 
 
was no water for the people to drink.
