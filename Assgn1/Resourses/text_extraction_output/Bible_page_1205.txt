  1206    Psalms 6 
8  Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; 
 
make thy way straight before my face. 
9  For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; 
 
their inward part is very wickedness; 
 
their throat is an open sepulchre; 
 
they flatter with their tongue.  
10  Destroy thou them, O God; 
 
let them fall by their own counsels; 
 
cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; 
 
for they have rebelled against thee. 
11  But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: 
 
let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: 
 
let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
12  For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; 
 
with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield.

A Prayer for Mercy in Time of Trouble 
To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, 
neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  
2  Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: 
   
O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 
 
3  My soul is also sore vexed: 
 
but thou, O Lord, how long? 
 
4  Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: 
 
oh save me for thy merciesâ€™ sake. 
5  For in death there is no remembrance of thee: 
 
in the grave who shall give thee thanks? 
 
6  I am weary with my groaning; 
 
all the night make I my bed to swim;
