  853    2 Kings 9 
22  Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. 
Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
23  And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?

the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
 
The Reign of Ahaziah of Judah 
25  ¶ In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did 
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 
26  Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and 
 
he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 
27  And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the 
sight of the Lord, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son-in-
 
law of the house of Ahab. 
28  ¶ And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against 
Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded 
 
Joram. 
29  And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds 
which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought 
against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king 
of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, 
because he was sick.
