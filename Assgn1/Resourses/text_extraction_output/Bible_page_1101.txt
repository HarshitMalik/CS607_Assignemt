35  and to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all 
fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the Lord:  
 
36  also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the 
law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the 
house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our 
God:  
 
37  and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our 
offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, 
unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the 
 
tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might 
have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. 
38  And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the 
Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the 
 
tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure 
house. 
39  For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the 
offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the 
chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests 
that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not 
 
forsake the house of our God.

The Residents of Jerusalem 
1  And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the 
 
people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the 
holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities. 
2  And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered 
themselves to dwell at Jerusalem. 
3  ¶ Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: 
 
but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their 
cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, 
and the children of Solomon’s servants.
