What  the  ancient  sages  transmitted  was  just  one  thing—
balance.  Not  being  biased,  not  being  prejudiced—this  is
the  substance  of  balance.  Not  going  too  far,  not  falling
short—this is the function of balance.
The  ancient  sage  Yao  said,  “Hold  sincerely  to  this
balance.”  Holding  to  balance  refers  to  both  action  and
quiet.  When  you  are  quiet,  you  hold  to  this  balance  by
conscious  presence  of  mind.  When  you  are  active,  you
hold  to  this  balance  by  adapting  to  events.  “Sincerely”
means trusting; it has the sense of spontaneously keeping
balance  at  all  times,  whatever  happens,  without  the
slightest effort or interruption.
The  ancient  sage  Shun  said,  “Be  focused,  be  unified.”
Clearly  seeing  the  fundamental  subtlety  is  called  being
focused;  being  consistently  undivided  is  called  being
unified.  This  says  that  people  must  have  focused  insight
and  unified  discipline  before  they  can  keep  balance.  The
word  sincerely  already  includes  this  meaning,  but  he
expressed it more clearly lest people would not understand
that.
“The human mentality is unstable, the mind of the Way
is faint.” Having thoughts is the human mentality; having
no  thoughts  is  the  mind  of  the  Way.  This  means  that  the
human  mentality  easily  flares  up,  while  the  mind  of  the
Way  easily  disappears.  This  speaks  of  the  potential
instability  and  faintness  to  make  people  wary,  so  people
will take care to keep balance.
