  2254    John 5 
6  When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long 
time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
 
7  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the 
water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, 
 
another steppeth down before me. 
8  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
9  And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, 
and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
 
10  ¶ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath 
day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.  
 
11  He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto 
me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
12  Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take 
up thy bed, and walk? 
 
13  And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed 
 
himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
14  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, 
Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come 
 
unto thee. 
15  The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had 
made him whole. 
16  And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, 
because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
17  But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 
18  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not 
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, 
making himself equal with God. 
The Authority of the Son 
19  ¶ Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the 
Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the 
 
Son likewise.
