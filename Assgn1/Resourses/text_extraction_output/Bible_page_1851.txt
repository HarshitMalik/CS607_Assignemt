  1852    Ezekiel 42 
8  For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty 
cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits. 
 
9  And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as 
one goeth into them from the outer court. 
10  ¶ The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court 
toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against 
the building. 
11  And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers 
which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: 
 
and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and 
according to their doors. 
12  And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the 
south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before 
the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. 
13  ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south 
chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy 
chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat 
the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and 
 
the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; 
 
for the place is holy. 
14  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the 
holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their 
garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on 
   
other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the 
people. 
15  ¶ Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he 
brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, 
and measured it round about. 
16  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred 
reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
17  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the 
measuring reed round about. 
18  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the 
measuring reed.
