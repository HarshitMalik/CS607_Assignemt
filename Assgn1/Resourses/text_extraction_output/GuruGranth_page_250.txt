Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, all are reduced to dust.  || 1 ||   
PAUREE:  DHADHA:  The dust of the feet of the Saints is sacred. Blessed are those 
whose minds are filled with  this longing. They do not seek wealth, and they do not 
desire paradise. They are immersed in the deep love of their Beloved, and the dust of 
the feet of the Holy. How can worldly affairs affect those who do not abandon the One 
Lord, and who go nowhere else? One whose heart is filled with God‟s Name, O Nanak, 
is a perfect spiritual being of God.  || 4 ||   SHALOK:  By all sorts of religious robes, 
knowledge,  meditation  and  stubborn-mindedness,  no  one  has  ever  met  God.  Says 
Nanak, those upon whom God showers His Mercy, are devotees of spiritual wisdom.  || 
1 ||   PAUREE:  NGANGA:  Spiritual wisdom is not obtained by mere words of mouth. It 
is not obtained through the various debates of the Shaastras and scriptures. They alone 
are  spiritually  wise,  whose  minds  are  firmly  fixed  on  the  Lord.  Hearing  and  telling 
stories,  no  one  attains  Yoga.  They  alone  are  spiritually  wise,  who  remain  firmly 
committed to the Lord‟s Command. Heat and cold are all the same to them. The true 
people of spiritual wisdom are the Gurmukhs, who contemplate the essence of reality; 
O Nanak, the Lord showers His Mercy upon them.  || 5 ||   SHALOK:  Those who have 
come into the world without understanding are like animals and beasts. O Nanak, those 
who become Gurmukh understand; upon their foreheads is such pre-ordained destiny.  
|| 1 ||   PAUREE:  They have come into this world to meditate on the One Lord. But 
ever since their birth, they have been enticed by the fascination of Maya. Upside-down 
in  the chamber  of the womb, they  performed intense meditation. They  remembered 
God in meditation with each and every breath. But now, they are entangled in things 
which they must leave behind. They forget the Great Giver from their minds. O Nanak, 
those upon whom the Lord showers His Mercy, do not forget Him, here or hereafter.  || 
6 ||   SHALOK:  By His Command, we come, and by His Command, we go; no one is 
beyond His Command. Coming and going in reincarnation is ended, O Nanak, for those 
whose minds are filled with the Lord.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  This soul has lived in many 
wombs. Enticed by sweet attachment, it has been trapped in reincarnation. This Maya 
has  subjugated  beings  through  the  three  qualities.  Maya  has  infused  attachment  to 
itself in each and every heart. O friend, tell me some way, by which I may swim across 
this treacherous ocean of Maya. The Lord showers His Mercy, and leads us to join the 
Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. O Nanak, Maya does not even come near.  || 7 ||   
SHALOK:  God Himself causes one to perform good and bad actions. The beast indulges 
in egotism, selfishness and conceit; O Nanak, without the Lord, what can anyone do?  
||  1  ||      PAUREE:    The  One  Lord  Himself  is  the  Cause  of  all  actions.  He  Himself 
distributes sins and noble acts. In this age, people are attached as the Lord attaches 
them.  They  receive  that  which  the  Lord  Himself  gives.  No  one  knows  His  limits. 
Whatever He does, comes to pass. From the One, the entire expanse of the Universe 
emanated. O Nanak, He Himself is our Saving Grace.  || 8 ||   SHALOK:  Man remains 
engrossed in women and playful pleasures; the tumult of his passion is like the dye of 
the safflower, which fades away all too soon.
