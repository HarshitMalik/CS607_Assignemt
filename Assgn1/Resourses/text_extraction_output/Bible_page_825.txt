  826    1 Kings 21 
the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee 
for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
 
16  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that 
Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, 
to take possession of it. 
17  ¶ And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
18  Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: 
 
behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to 
possess it. 
19  And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast 
thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto 
 
him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked 
the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. 
20  ¶ And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? 
 
And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself 
 
to work evil in the sight of the Lord. 
21  Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy 
posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the 
wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
22  and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of 
Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the 
provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made 
Israel to sin. 
23  And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat 
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.  
24  Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that 
 
dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. 
25  ¶ But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to 
work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife 
stirred up. 
26  And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all 
things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the 
children of Israel.
