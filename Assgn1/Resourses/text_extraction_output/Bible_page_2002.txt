Malachi 
[Malachi] 
1 
The Lord’s Love for Jacob 
1  The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. 
2  ¶ I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou 
loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved 
     
Jacob, 
3  and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for 
the dragons of the wilderness. 
4  Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and 
build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall 
 
build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border 
 
of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath 
indignation for ever. 
5  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord will be 
magnified from the border of Israel. 
The Lord Rebukes the Priests 
6  ¶ A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a 
 
father, where is mine honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? 
   
saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. 
And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
 
7  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have 
 
we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is 
 
contemptible. 
8  And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer 
 
the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will 
   
he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of 
 
hosts.
