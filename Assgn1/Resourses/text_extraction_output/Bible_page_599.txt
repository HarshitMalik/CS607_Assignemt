  600    Judges 18 
13  And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the 
house of Micah. 
14  ¶ Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of 
Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in 
these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a 
molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 
 
15  And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young 
man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. 
16  And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, 
which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the 
gate. 
17  And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came 
in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the 
teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the 
 
entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed 
with weapons of war. 
18  And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image, 
the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the 
priest unto them, What do ye? 
 
19  And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy 
mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better 
 
for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a 
priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 
 
20  And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the 
teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the 
people. 
21  ¶ So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle 
and the carriage before them. 
22  And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men 
that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered 
together, and overtook the children of Dan. 
23  And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their 
faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest 
with such a company?
