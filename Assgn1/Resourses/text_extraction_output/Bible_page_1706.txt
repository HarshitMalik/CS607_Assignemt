son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go 
over to the Ammonites. 
11  ¶ But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the 
forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son 
of Nethaniah had done, 
12  then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son 
of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in 
Gibeon. 
13  Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with 
Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the 
forces that were with him, then they were glad. 
14  So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from 
Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of 
Kareah. 
15  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight 
men, and went to the Ammonites. 
16  Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the 
forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he 
had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, 
after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty 
men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, 
whom he had brought again from Gibeon: 
 
17  and they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which 
is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
18  because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because 
 
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of 
Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
