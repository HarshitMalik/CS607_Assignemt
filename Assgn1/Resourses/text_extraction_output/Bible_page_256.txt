  257    Leviticus 13 
37  But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair 
grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest 
   
shall pronounce him clean. 
38  ¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright 
spots, even white bright spots; 
 
39  then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the 
 
skin of their flesh be darkish white, it is a freckled spot that groweth 
in the skin: he is clean. 
 
40  ¶ And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he 
 
clean. 
41  And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward 
his face, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean. 
 
42  And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish 
sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 
 
43  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the 
 
sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as 
the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 
 
44  he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him 
 
utterly unclean; his plague is in his head. 
 
45  ¶ And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and 
his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and 
shall cry, Unclean, unclean. 
46  All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; 
 
he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his 
   
habitation be. 
47  ¶ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a 
woolen garment, or a linen garment; 
 
48  whether it be in the warp, or woof, of linen, or of woolen; whether 
 
in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; 
 
49  and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the 
skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is 
 
a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest: 
 
50  and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath 
the plague seven days:
