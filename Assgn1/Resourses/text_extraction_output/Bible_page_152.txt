  153    Exodus 12 
35  And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and 
 
they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, 
and raiment: 
 
36  and the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so 
that they lent unto them such things as they required: and they 
 
spoiled the Egyptians.  
The Israelites Leave Egypt 
37  ¶ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, 
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 
38  And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and 
 
herds, even very much cattle. 
39  And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought 
forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were 
 
thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared 
for themselves any victuals. 
40  ¶ Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, 
was four hundred and thirty years.  
41  And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, 
even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord 
went out from the land of Egypt. 
42  It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them 
out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be 
 
observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. 
43  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance 
of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 
   
44  but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast 
circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
45  A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
46  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of 
 
the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone 
 
thereof.  
47  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
