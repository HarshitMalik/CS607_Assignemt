He has not taken my merits and demerits into account. Your Word is eternal, O Guru 
Nanak;  You  placed  Your  Hand  of  blessing  upon  my  forehead.    ||  2  ||  21  ||  49  ||   
SORAT‟H,  FIFTH MEHL:  All beings and creatures were created by Him; He alone is the 
support and friend of the Saints. He Himself preserves the honor of His servants; their 
glorious greatness becomes perfect.  || 1 ||   The Perfect Supreme Lord God is always 
with me. The Perfect Guru has perfectly and totally protected me, and now everyone is 
kind and compassionate to me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Night and day, Nanak meditates on 
the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He is the Giver of the soul, and the breath of life 
itself. He hugs His slave close in His loving embrace, like the mother and father hug 
their child.  || 2 || 22 || 50 ||    
 
SORAT‟H,  FIFTH MEHL,  THIRD HOUSE,  CHAU-PADAS:

NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Meeting with  the council, my  doubts were not dispelled. The chiefs did not give me 
satisfaction. I presented my dispute to the noblemen as well. But it was only settled by 
meeting with the King, my Lord.  || 1 ||   Now, I do not go searching anywhere else, 
because I have met the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.  ||  Pause  ||   When I came to 
God‟s Darbaar, His Holy Court, then all of my cries and complaints were settled. Now 
that I have attained what I had sought, where should I come and where should I go?  
|| 2 ||   There, true justice is administered. There, the Lord Master and His disciple are 
one  and  the  same.  The  Inner-knower,  the  Searcher  of  hearts,  knows.  Without  our 
speaking, He understands.  || 3 ||   He is the King of all places. There, the unstruck 
melody  of  the  Shabad  resounds.  Of  what  use  is  cleverness when  dealing with  Him? 
Meeting with Him, O Nanak, one loses his self-conceit.  || 4 || 1 || 51 ||   SORAT‟H,  
FIFTH  MEHL:    Enshrine  the  Naam,  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  within  your  heart;  sitting 
within your own home, meditate on the Guru. The Perfect Guru has spoken the Truth; 
the True Peace is obtained only from the Lord.  || 1 ||   My Guru has become merciful. 
In bliss, peace, pleasure and joy, I have returned to my own home, after my purifying 
bath.  ||  Pause  ||   True is the glorious greatness of the Guru; His worth cannot be 
described. He is the Supreme Overlord of kings. Meeting with the Guru, the mind is 
enraptured.  || 2 ||   All sins are washed away, meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the 
Company of the Holy. The Lord‟s Name is the treasure of excellence; chanting it, one‟s 
affairs are perfectly resolved.  || 3 ||   The Guru has opened the door of liberation, and 
the entire world applauds Him with cheers of victory. O Nanak, God is always with me; 
my fears of birth and death are gone.  || 4 || 2 || 52 ||   SORAT‟H,  FIFTH MEHL:  The 
Perfect Guru has granted His Grace, and God has fulfilled my desire. After taking my 
bath of purification, I returned to my home, and I found bliss, happiness and peace.  || 
1 ||   O Saints, salvation comes from the Lord‟s Name. While standing up and sitting 
down, meditate on the Lord‟s Name.
