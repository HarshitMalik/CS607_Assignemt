  1377    Psalms 126 
126 
Thanksgiving for Restoration 
A Song of degrees. 
1  When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, 
we were like them that dream. 
2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, 
and our tongue with singing: 
 
then said they among the heathen, 
The Lord hath done great things for them. 
3  The Lord hath done great things for us; 
 
whereof we are glad. 
4  Turn again our captivity, O Lord, 
as the streams in the south. 
5  They that sow in tears 
shall reap in joy. 
6  He that goeth forth and weepeth, 
bearing precious seed, 
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, 
bringing his sheaves with him.

Prosperity Comes from the Lord 
A Song of degrees for Solomon. 
1  Except the Lord build the house, 
they labor in vain that build it: 
 
except the Lord keep the city, 
the watchman waketh but in vain. 
2  It is vain for you to rise up early, 
to sit up late,
