  2049    Matthew 14 
55  Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and 
   
his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 
 
56  And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this 
 
man all these things? 
 
57  And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A 
prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his 
own house.  
58  And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 
14 
The Death of John the Baptist 
1  At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
2  and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from 
 
the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in 
 
him. 
3  For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in 
prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife. 
4  For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.  
5  And when he would have put him to death, he feared the 
multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
6  But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias 
danced before them, and pleased Herod. 
7  Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she 
would ask. 
8  And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here 
John Baptist’s head in a charger. 
9  And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them 
 
which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. 
10  And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
11  And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: 
 
and she brought it to her mother. 
12  And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and 
went and told Jesus.
