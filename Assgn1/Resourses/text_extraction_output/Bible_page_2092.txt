  2093    Matthew 27 
49  The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save 
him. 
50  Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the 
ghost. 
51  ¶ And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the 
top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 
   
52  and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which 
 
slept arose, 
53  and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the 
holy city, and appeared unto many. 
54  Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching 
Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they 
feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 
55  ¶ And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed 
Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
 
56  among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James 
and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.  
The Burial of Jesus 
57  ¶ When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, 
named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: 
 
58  he went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate 
commanded the body to be delivered. 
59  And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean 
linen cloth, 
60  and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the 
rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and 
 
departed. 
61  And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over 
against the sepulchre.
