  1400    Psalms 149 
9  mountains, and all hills; 
 
fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
 
10  beasts, and all cattle; 
 
creeping things, and flying fowl: 
 
11  kings of the earth, and all people; 
 
princes, and all judges of the earth: 
 
12  both young men, and maidens; 
 
old men, and children: 
 
13  let them praise the name of the Lord: 
 
for his name alone is excellent; 
 
his glory is above the earth and heaven. 
14  He also exalteth the horn of his people, 
the praise of all his saints; 
 
even of the children of Israel, 
a people near unto him. 
Praise ye the Lord. 
149 
Israel Exhorted to Praise the Lord 
1  Praise ye the Lord. 
Sing unto the Lord a new song, 
and his praise in the congregation of saints. 
2  Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: 
 
let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
3  Let them praise his name in the dance: 
 
let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
4  For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: 
 
he will beautify the meek with salvation. 
5  Let the saints be joyful in glory: 
 
let them sing aloud upon their beds. 
6  Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, 
and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
 
7  to execute vengeance upon the heathen,
