  1679    Jeremiah 31 
20  Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation 
shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress 
them. 
21  And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall 
proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, 
 
and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his 
 
heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord. 
 
22  And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
23  Â¶ Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a 
continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the 
 
wicked. 
24  The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have done it, 
and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter 
 
days ye shall consider it. 
31 
1  At the same time, saith the Lord, will I be the God of all the 
families of Israel, and they shall be my people. 
2  Thus saith the Lord, The people which were left of the sword found 
grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to 
 
rest. 
3  The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved 
thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have 
 
I drawn thee. 
4  Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: 
 
thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in 
the dances of them that make merry. 
5  Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the 
 
planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things. 
6  For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount 
Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord 
our God.
