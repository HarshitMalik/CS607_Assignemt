  1603    Isaiah 63 
3  I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was 
 
none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample 
 
them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my 
 
garments, and I will stain all my raiment.  
4  For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my 
redeemed is come. 
5  And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there 
 
was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation 
 
unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.  
 
6  And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them 
drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. 
The Lord’s Goodness to Israel 
7  ¶ I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises 
of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, 
and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath 
bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the 
multitude of his loving-kindnesses. 
8  For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so 
 
he was their Saviour. 
9  In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence 
saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he 
   
bare them, and carried them all the days of old. 
10  ¶ But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore he was 
 
turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. 
11  Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, 
Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd 
of his flock? where is he that put his Holy Spirit within him? 
   
12  that led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, 
dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting 
name? 
 
13  that led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, that 
they should not stumble?
