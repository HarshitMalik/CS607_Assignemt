  800    1 Kings 13 
13 
The Prophet of Judah Warns Jeroboam 
1  And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of 
the Lord unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn 
 
incense. 
2  And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O 
altar, altar, thus saith the Lord; Behold, a child shall be born unto 
 
the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer 
 
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and 
men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee.  
3  And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the 
Lord hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes 
 
that are upon it shall be poured out. 
4  And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the 
man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he 
put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his 
hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could 
not pull it in again to him. 
5  The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, 
according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word 
of the Lord. 
6  And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now 
the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may 
be restored me again. And the man of God besought the Lord, and 
the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was 
before. 
7  And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and 
refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
8  And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half 
thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor 
drink water in this place:
