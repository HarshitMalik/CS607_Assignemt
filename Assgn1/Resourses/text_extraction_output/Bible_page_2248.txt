  2249    John 3 
21  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be 
made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 
He Must Increase, but I Must Decrease 
22  ¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of 
Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
 
23  And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there 
was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
 
24  For John was not yet cast into prison.  
25  ¶ Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and 
the Jews about purifying. 
26  And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was 
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the 
same baptizeth, and all men come to him. 
27  John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be 
given him from heaven. 
28  Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but 
that I am sent before him. 
29  He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the 
 
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly 
because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
 
30  He must increase, but I must decrease. 
The Testimony from Heaven 
31  ¶ He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is 
 
earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is 
 
above all. 
32  And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man 
 
receiveth his testimony. 
33  He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is 
true. 
34  For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God 
 
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
