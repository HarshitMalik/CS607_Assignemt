  214    Exodus 36 
The Making of the Tabernacle 
8  ¶ And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work 
of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, 
and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work made he 
 
them. 
9  The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the 
breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. 
 
10  ¶ And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other 
 
five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
11  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the 
selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of 
 
another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
12  Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the 
edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the 
 
loops held one curtain to another. 
13  And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto 
another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 
 
14  ¶ And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the 
tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
 
15  The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the 
breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. 
 
16  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by 
themselves. 
17  And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in 
the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain 
which coupleth the second. 
18  And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it 
might be one. 
19  And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a 
covering of badgers’ skins above that. 
20  ¶ And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing 
up. 
21  The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one 
cubit and a half.
