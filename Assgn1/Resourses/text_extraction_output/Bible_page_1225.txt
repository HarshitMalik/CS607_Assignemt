  1226    Psalms 22 
12  Many bulls have compassed me: 
 
strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 
13  They gaped upon me with their mouths, 
as a ravening and a roaring lion. 
14  I am poured out like water, 
and all my bones are out of joint: 
 
my heart is like wax; 
 
it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 
15  My strength is dried up like a potsherd; 
 
and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; 
 
and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
16  For dogs have compassed me: 
 
the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: 
 
they pierced my hands and my feet. 
17  I may tell all my bones: 
 
they look and stare upon me. 
18  They part my garments among them, 
and cast lots upon my vesture.  
19  But be not thou far from me, O Lord: 
 
O my strength, haste thee to help me. 
20  Deliver my soul from the sword; 
 
my darling from the power of the dog. 
21  Save me from the lionâ€™s mouth: 
 
for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 
22  I will declare thy name unto my brethren: 
 
in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.  
23  Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; 
 
all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; 
 
and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
24  For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the 
afflicted; 
 
neither hath he hid his face from him; 
 
but when he cried unto him, he heard. 
25  My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: 
 
I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
