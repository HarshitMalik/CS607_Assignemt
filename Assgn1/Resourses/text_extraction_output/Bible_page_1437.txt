  1438    Proverbs 20 
10  Divers weights, and divers measures, 
both of them are alike abomination to the Lord. 
11  Even a child is known by his doings, 
whether his work be pure, 
and whether it be right. 
12  The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, 
the Lord hath made even both of them. 
13  Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty: 
 
open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
14  It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: 
 
but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 
15  There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: 
 
but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 
16  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: 
 
and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
17  Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; 
 
but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 
18  Every purpose is established by counsel: 
 
and with good advice make war. 
19  He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: 
 
therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 
20  Whoso curseth his father or his mother, 
his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 
21  An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; 
 
but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 
22  Say not thou, I will recompense evil; 
 
but wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee. 
23  Divers weights are an abomination unto the Lord; 
 
and a false balance is not good. 
24  Manâ€™s goings are of the Lord; 
 
how can a man then understand his own way? 
 
25  It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, 
and after vows to make inquiry. 
26  A wise king scattereth the wicked, 
and bringeth the wheel over them.
