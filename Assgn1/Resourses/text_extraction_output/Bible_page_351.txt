  352    Numbers 17 
46  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein 
from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the 
congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath 
 
gone out from the Lord; the plague is begun. 
 
47  And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of 
the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the 
 
people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the 
 
people. 
48  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was 
 
stayed. 
49  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and 
seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. 
50  And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of 
the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

Aaron’s Rod 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a 
rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes 
according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: write thou 
 
every man’s name upon his rod. 
3  And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one 
 
rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers. 
4  And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation 
before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 
5  And it shall come to pass, that the man’s rod, whom I shall choose, 
shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of 
 
the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 
6  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their 
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to 
their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was 
 
among their rods.
