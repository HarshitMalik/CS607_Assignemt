  638    1 Samuel 9 
18  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray 
thee, where the seer’s house is. 
19  And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me 
 
unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I 
 
will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. 
20  And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy 
mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of 
 
Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house? 
   
21  And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest 
of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of 
 
the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? 
   
22  ¶ And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the 
parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that 
were bidden, which were about thirty persons. 
23  And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave 
thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
24  And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and 
set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it 
 
before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee 
 
since I said, I have invited the people. 
¶ So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 
25  And when they were come down from the high place into the city, 
Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 
26  And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the 
 
day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, 
that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both 
of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
27  ¶ And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to 
Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but 
stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.
