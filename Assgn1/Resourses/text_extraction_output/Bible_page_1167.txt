  1168    Job 24 
and the Almighty troubleth me: 
 
17  because I was not cut off before the darkness, 
neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.

Job Complains of God’s Indifference to Wickedness 
1  Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, 
do they that know him not see his days? 
 
2  Some remove the landmarks; 
 
they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 
3  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, 
they take the widow’s ox for a pledge. 
4  They turn the needy out of the way: 
 
the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
5  Behold, as wild asses in the desert, 
go they forth to their work; 
 
rising betimes for a prey: 
 
the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 
6  They reap every one his corn in the field: 
 
and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
7  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, 
that they have no covering in the cold. 
8  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, 
and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
9  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, 
and take a pledge of the poor. 
10  They cause him to go naked without clothing, 
and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 
 
11  which make oil within their walls, 
and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
12  Men groan from out of the city, 
and the soul of the wounded crieth out: 
 
yet God layeth not folly to them.
