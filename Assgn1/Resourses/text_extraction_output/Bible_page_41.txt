  42    Genesis 19 
22  Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be 
 
come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar 
[little]. 
23  The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
24  ¶ Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah 
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; 
 
25  and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the 
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
26  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar 
of salt. 
27  And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he 
stood before the Lord: 
 
28  and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the 
land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country 
went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
29  ¶ And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, 
that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of 
the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot 
dwelt. 
30  ¶ And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his 
two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he 
   
dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
31  And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there 
is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all 
the earth: 
 
32  come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, 
that we may preserve seed of our father. 
33  And they made their father drink wine that night: and the 
 
firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not 
 
when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
34  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the 
younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him 
 
drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that 
 
we may preserve seed of our father.
