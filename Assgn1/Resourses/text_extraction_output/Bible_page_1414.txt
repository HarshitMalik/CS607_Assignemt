  1415    Proverbs 8 
with the flattering of her lips she forced him. 
22  He goeth after her straightway, 
as an ox goeth to the slaughter, 
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 
 
23  till a dart strike through his liver; 
 
as a bird hasteth to the snare, 
and knoweth not that it is for his life. 
24  Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, 
and attend to the words of my mouth. 
25  Let not thine heart decline to her ways, 
go not astray in her paths. 
26  For she hath cast down many wounded: 
 
yea, many strong men have been slain by her. 
27  Her house is the way to hell, 
going down to the chambers of death.

The Excellence and Eternity of Wisdom 
1  Doth not wisdom cry? 
 
and understanding put forth her voice? 
 
2  She standeth in the top of high places, 
by the way in the places of the paths. 
3  She crieth at the gates, 
at the entry of the city, 
at the coming in at the doors:  
 
4  Unto you, O men, I call; 
 
and my voice is to the sons of man. 
5  O ye simple, understand wisdom: 
 
and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 
6  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; 
   
and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 
7  For my mouth shall speak truth; 
 
and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
