  1414    Proverbs 7 
5  that they may keep thee from the strange woman, 
from the stranger which flattereth with her words. 
6  For at the window of my house 
I looked through my casement, 
7  and beheld among the simple ones, 
I discerned among the youths, 
a young man void of understanding, 
8  passing through the street near her corner; 
 
and he went the way to her house, 
9  in the twilight, in the evening, 
in the black and dark night. 
10  And, behold, there met him a woman 
with the attire of a harlot, and subtile of heart. 
11  (She is loud and stubborn; 
 
her feet abide not in her house: 
 
12  now is she without, now in the streets, 
and lieth in wait at every corner.) 
13  So she caught him, and kissed him, 
and with an impudent face said unto him, 
14  I have peace offerings with me; 
 
this day have I paid my vows. 
15  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, 
diligently to seek thy face, 
and I have found thee. 
16  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, 
with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. 
17  I have perfumed my bed 
with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
18  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: 
 
let us solace ourselves with loves. 
19  For the goodman is not at home, 
he is gone a long journey: 
 
20  he hath taken a bag of money with him, 
and will come home at the day appointed. 
21  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
