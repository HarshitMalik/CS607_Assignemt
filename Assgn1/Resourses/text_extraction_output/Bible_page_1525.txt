  1526    Isaiah 21 
4  so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and 
the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even 
with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
5  And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, 
and of Egypt their glory. 
6  And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is 
our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the 
king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

The Oracle concerning the Desert of the Sea 
1  The burden of the desert of the sea. 
Â¶ As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the 
 
desert, from a terrible land. 
2  A grievous vision is declared unto me; The treacherous dealer 
 
dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: 
 
besiege, O Media: all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 
 
3  Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold 
 
upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed 
 
down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it. 
 
4  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my 
 
pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. 
5  Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye 
 
princes, and anoint the shield. 
6  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him 
declare what he seeth. 
7  And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, 
and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much 
 
heed: 
 
8  and he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the 
 
watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 
 
9  and, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of 
horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen;
