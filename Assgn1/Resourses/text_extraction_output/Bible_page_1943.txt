The Humbling of Edom 
1  ¶ The vision of Obadiah. 
¶ Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard a 
 
rumor from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the 
heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. 
2  Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art 
 
greatly despised. 
3  The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in 
the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his 
 
heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? 
 
4  Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest 
among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord. 
5  ¶ If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) 
 
would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape 
 
gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes? 
 
6  How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things 
 
sought up! 
 
7  All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the 
border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, 
 
and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound 
 
under thee: there is none understanding in him. 
 
8  Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men 
out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? 
 
9  And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that 
every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. 
10  For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, 
and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 
11  In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the 
strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered
