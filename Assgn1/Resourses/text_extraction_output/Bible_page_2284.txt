  2285    John 13 
28  Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto 
him. 
29  For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had 
said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the 
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
 
30  He then, having received the sop, went immediately out; and it was 
 
night. 
The New Commandment 
31  ¶ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of 
man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
32  If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, 
and shall straightway glorify him. 
33  Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; 
 
and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I 
 
say to you. 
34  A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as 
 
I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
35  By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love 
one to another. 
Peter’s Denial Foretold 
36  ¶ Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus 
 
answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but 
 
thou shalt follow me afterward. 
37  Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay 
 
down my life for thy sake. 
38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? 
 
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast 
denied me thrice.
