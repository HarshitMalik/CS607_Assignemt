Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And 
when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth 
of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. 
22  Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the 
hand of all other, and guided them on every side. 
23  And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents 
to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of 
 
all nations from thenceforth. 
Hezekiah’s Sickness 
24  ¶ In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the 
Lord: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. 
 
25  But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto 
him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon 
   
him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
26  Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his 
heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of 
the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 
Hezekiah Receives Envoys from Babylon 
27  ¶ And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he 
 
made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious 
stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of 
pleasant jewels; 
 
28  storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and 
 
stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
29  Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and 
herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 
 
30  This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, 
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. 
And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
