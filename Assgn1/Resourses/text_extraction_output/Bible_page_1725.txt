  1726    Jeremiah 50 
Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images 
 
are broken in pieces. 
3  For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which 
shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they 
 
shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. 
4  ¶ In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of 
Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going 
and weeping: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. 
 
5  They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, 
Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual 
covenant that shall not be forgotten. 
6  ¶ My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused 
 
them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: 
 
they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their 
resting place. 
7  All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries 
 
said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord, 
the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers. 
8  ¶ Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land 
of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. 
9  For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an 
assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall 
 
set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: 
   
their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in 
 
vain. 
10  And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, 
 
saith the Lord. 
11  ¶ Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine 
heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow 
as bulls; 
 
12  your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be 
 
ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a 
 
wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
