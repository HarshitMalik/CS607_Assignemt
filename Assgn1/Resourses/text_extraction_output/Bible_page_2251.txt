  2252    John 4 
32  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 
33  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought 
him aught to eat? 
 
34  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent 
me, and to finish his work. 
35  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? 
 
behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for 
 
they are white already to harvest. 
36  And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life 
eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice 
 
together. 
37  And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
38  I sent you to reap that whereupon ye bestowed no labor: other men 
 
labored, and ye are entered into their labors. 
39  ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the 
saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
40  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him 
that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
 
41  And many more believed because of his own word; 
 
42  and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy 
saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is 
 
indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 
Jesus Heals a Nobleman’s Son 
43  ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
44  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own 
country.  
45  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, 
having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for 
 
they also went unto the feast. 
46  ¶ So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the 
water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick 
at Capernaum.
