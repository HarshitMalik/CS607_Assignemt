  601    Judges 19 
24  And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the 
priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is 
   
this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee? 
 
25  And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard 
among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, 
with the lives of thy household. 
26  And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that 
 
they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his 
house. 
27  ¶ And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest 
which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet 
and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and 
 
burnt the city with fire. 
28  And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they 
had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by 
 
Beth-rehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein. 
29  And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan 
their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the 
 
city was Laish at the first. 
30  And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, 
 
the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were 
priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
31  And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the 
time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

The Levite and His Concubine 
1  And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, 
that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount 
Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah. 
2  And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away 
from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was 
there four whole months.
