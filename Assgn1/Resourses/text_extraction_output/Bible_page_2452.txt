  2453    1 Corinthians 16 
51  ¶ Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall 
 
all be changed, 
52  in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the 
 
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and 
we shall be changed.  
53  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must 
put on immortality. 
54  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this 
mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass 
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  
55  O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?  
   
56  The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. 
 
57  But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
58  ¶ Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, 
always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know 
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

The Collection for the Saints 
1  Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order 
to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
2  Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in 
store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when 
I come. 
3  And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, 
them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
4  And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

for I do pass through Macedonia.
