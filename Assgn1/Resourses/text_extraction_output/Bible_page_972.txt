Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom 
1  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, 
and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him 
exceedingly. 
2  ¶ Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands 
and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all 
Israel, the chief of the fathers. 
3  So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high 
place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the 
 
congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had 
made in the wilderness. 
4  But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the 
place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it 
 
at Jerusalem.  
5  Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of 
Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the Lord: and 
 
Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. 
6  And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the Lord, 
which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a 
thousand burnt offerings upon it. 
7  ¶ In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, 
Ask what I shall give thee. 
8  And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto 
David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 
9  Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be 
established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust 
 
of the earth in multitude.
