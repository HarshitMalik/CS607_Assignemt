  1339    Psalms 104 
2  who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: 
 
who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 
 
3  who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: 
 
who maketh the clouds his chariot: 
 
who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 
 
4  who maketh his angels spirits; 
 
his ministers a flaming fire:  
 
5  who laid the foundations of the earth, 
that it should not be removed for ever. 
6  Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: 
 
the waters stood above the mountains. 
7  At thy rebuke they fled; 
 
at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 
8  They go up by the mountains; 
 
they go down by the valleys 
unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 
9  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; 
 
that they turn not again to cover the earth. 
10  He sendeth the springs into the valleys, 
which run among the hills. 
11  They give drink to every beast of the field: 
 
the wild asses quench their thirst. 
12  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, 
which sing among the branches. 
13  He watereth the hills from his chambers: 
 
the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
14  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, 
and herb for the service of man: 
 
that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 
 
15  and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, 
and oil to make his face to shine, 
and bread which strengtheneth manâ€™s heart. 
16  The trees of the Lord are full of sap; 
 
the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 
 
17  where the birds make their nests:
