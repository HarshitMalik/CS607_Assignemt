  1500    Isaiah 5 
shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a 
 
defense. 
6  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from 
the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and 
from rain.

The Parable of the Vineyard 
1  Now will I sing to my well-beloved 
a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.  
My well-beloved hath a vineyard 
in a very fruitful hill: 
 
2  and he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, 
and planted it with the choicest vine, 
and built a tower in the midst of it, 
and also made a winepress therein: 
 
and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, 
and it brought forth wild grapes. 
3  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, 
judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 
4  What could have been done more to my vineyard, 
that I have not done in it? 
 
Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, 
brought it forth wild grapes? 
 
5  And now go to; 
 
I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: 
 
I will take away the hedge thereof, 
and it shall be eaten up; 
 
and break down the wall thereof, 
and it shall be trodden down: 
 
6  and I will lay it waste: 
 
it shall not be pruned, nor digged; 
 
but there shall come up briers and thorns:
