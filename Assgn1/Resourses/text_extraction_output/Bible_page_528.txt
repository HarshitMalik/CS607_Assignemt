  529    Joshua 15 
Caleb Conquers Hebron and Debir 
13  ¶ And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the 
children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to 
Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is 
Hebron. 
14  And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and 
Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.  
15  And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name 
 
of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher. 
16  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to 
him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
17  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he 
 
gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
18  And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to 
ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said 
   
unto her, What wouldest thou? 
 
19  Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south 
 
land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper 
 
springs, and the nether springs.
