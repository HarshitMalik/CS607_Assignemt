  91    Genesis 38 
27  Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand 
be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh: and his brethren 
   
were content. 
28  Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and 
 
lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites 
for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  
 
29  ¶ And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not 
 
in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
 
30  And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and 
 
I, whither shall I go? 
 
31  And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and 
dipped the coat in the blood; 
 
32  and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their 
father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy 
   
son’s coat or no. 
33  And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath 
 
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 
 
34  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and 
mourned for his son many days. 
35  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but 
 
he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the 
 
grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 
36  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of 
Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.

Judah and Tamar 
1  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his 
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was 
Hirah. 
2  And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose 
name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 
 
3  And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
