  2075    Matthew 23 
8  But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and 
   
all ye are brethren. 
9  And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, 
 
which is in heaven. 
10  Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. 
 
11  But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.  
12  And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall 
 
humble himself shall be exalted.  
13  ¶ But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut 
 
up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in 
 
yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. 
14  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour 
 
widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye 
 
shall receive the greater damnation. 
15  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea 
 
and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make 
 
him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. 
16  ¶ Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear 
by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold 
 
of the temple, he is a debtor! 
 
17  Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple 
 
that sanctifieth the gold? 
 
18  And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but 
 
whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. 
19  Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that 
 
sanctifieth the gift? 
 
20  Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all 
things thereon. 
21  And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him 
that dwelleth therein. 
22  And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, 
and by him that sitteth thereon. 
23  ¶ Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe 
 
of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier
