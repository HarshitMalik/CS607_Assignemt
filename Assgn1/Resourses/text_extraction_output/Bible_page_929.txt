11 
David Made King over Israel 
1  Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, 
Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
2  And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he 
that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord thy God 
 
said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be 
ruler over my people Israel. 
3  Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and 
 
David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; 
 
and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of 
the Lord by Samuel. 
David Captures Zion 
4  ¶ And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where 
 
the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. 
5  And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come 
hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city 
of David. 
6  And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief 
and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. 
7  And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of 
 
David. 
8  And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: 
 
and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
9  So David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of hosts was with 
 
him. 
David’s Mighty Men 
10  ¶ These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who 
strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
