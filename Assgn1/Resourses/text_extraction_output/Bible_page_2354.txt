  2355    Acts 17 
38  And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they 
 
feared, when they heard that they were Romans. 
39  And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and 
desired them to depart out of the city. 
40  And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: 
 
and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and 
departed.

The Uproar in Thessalonica 
1  Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, 
they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
 
2  and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath 
days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, 
3  opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and 
risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto 
 
you, is Christ. 
4  And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and 
 
of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not 
a few. 
5  But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them 
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and 
set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and 
sought to bring them out to the people. 
6  And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain 
brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned 
the world upside down are come hither also; 
 
7  whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees 
 
of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. 
8  And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they 
heard these things. 
9  And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the others, they 
let them go.
