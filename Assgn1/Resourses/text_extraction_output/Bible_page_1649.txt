  1650    Jeremiah 18 
20  and say unto them, Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of 
Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that 
enter in by these gates: 
 
21  thus saith the Lord; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden 
 
on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;  
 
22  neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, 
neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I 
commanded your fathers.  
23  But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their 
neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 
24  ¶ And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith 
the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on 
the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; 
 
25  then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes 
sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, 
they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 
 
26  And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places 
about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the 
plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt 
offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and 
bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the Lord. 
27  But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and 
not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on 
the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it 
 
shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

2  Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee 
to hear my words.
