  2474    2 Corinthians 12 
4  how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable 
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
5  Of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine 
 
infirmities. 
6  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will 
 
say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me 
 
above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. 
7  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance 
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the 
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above 
measure. 
8  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from 
me. 
9  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my 
 
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I 
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest 
upon me. 
10  Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in 
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when 
 
I am weak, then am I strong. 
11  ¶ I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I 
   
ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind 
 
the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
12  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all 
patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
13  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it 
be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. 
 
Paul Plans a Third Visit 
14  ¶ Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not 
 
be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the 
   
children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the 
children.
