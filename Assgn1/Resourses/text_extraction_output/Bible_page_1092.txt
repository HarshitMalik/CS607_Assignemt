59  the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of 
Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon. 
60  ¶ All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were 
three hundred ninety and two. 
61  ¶ And these were they which went up also from Tel-melah, Tel-
haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show 
 
their father’s house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. 
62  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of 
Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 
63  And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, 
 
the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of 
Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name. 
64  These sought their register among those that were reckoned by 
genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, 
 
put from the priesthood. 
65  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the 
most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and 
Thummim.  
66  ¶ The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand 
three hundred and threescore, 
67  besides their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there 
were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had 
 
two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 
68  Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two 
 
hundred forty and five: 
 
69  their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven 
 
hundred and twenty asses. 
70  ¶ And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The 
Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty 
basins, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments. 
71  And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work 
twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two 
hundred pounds of silver.
