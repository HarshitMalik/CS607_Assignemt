the celestial design is always present.
Every day, first be quiet for a time, until body and mind
are both peacefully settled and your breathing is gentle and
even. Now lightly close your eyes and gaze into the region
below the heart and above the genitals, within a space of
1.3  inches,  without  becoming  fixated  on  it  and  without
departing  from  it  either.  Do  not  forget  it,  do  not  force  it.
When  myriad  thoughts  disappear  and  the  soul  alone  is
present, this is called right mindfulness.
At  this  time,  in  this  mindfulness  is  liveliness  and
buoyancy; in that energy is serenity and contentment.
When exhalation rises, it is not to collide with the heart
above; when inhalation descends, it is not to collide with
the  genitals  below.  Closing  and  opening,  coming  and
going, practice this for one or two weeks, and naturally the
kidneys  and  genitals  will  gradually  steam,  the  energy  in
the  elixir  field  will  be  warm.  Breathing  will  be
spontaneously tuned without your having to tune it; energy
will  be  spontaneously  refined  without  your  needing  to
refine it.
Once  energy  and  breath  are  harmonized,  then  there  is
naturally no exit or entry, no coming or going above, in the
middle, or below. This is womb breathing. This is spiritual
breathing.  This  is  the  true  bellows,  the  true  cauldron  and
furnace.  This  is  returning  to  the  root  and  restoring  life.
This  is  the  opening  of  the  mysterious  female,  the  root  of
heaven and earth.
