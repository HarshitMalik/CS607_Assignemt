  1463    Ecclesiastes 2 
The Experience of the Preacher 
12  ¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
13  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning 
all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God 
 
given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 
14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, 
 
all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
15  That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is 
 
wanting cannot be numbered. 
16  ¶ I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great 
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been 
before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of 
 
wisdom and knowledge.  
17  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and 
folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
 
18  For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth 
 
knowledge increaseth sorrow. 
2 
1  I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; 
 
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. 
 
2  I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
   
3  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting 
mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see 
 
what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do 
under the heaven all the days of their life. 
4  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me 
   
vineyards: 
 
5  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all 
kind of fruits: 
 
6  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that 
bringeth forth trees:
