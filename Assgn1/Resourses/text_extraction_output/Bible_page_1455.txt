  1456    Proverbs 30 
for though he understand he will not answer. 
20  Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? 
 
There is more hope of a fool than of him. 
21  He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child 
shall have him become his son at the length. 
22  An angry man stirreth up strife, 
and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 
23  A man’s pride shall bring him low: 
 
but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit. 
24  Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: 
 
he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. 
25  The fear of man bringeth a snare: 
 
but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe. 
26  Many seek the ruler’s favor; 
 
but every man’s judgment cometh from the Lord. 
27  An unjust man is an abomination to the just: 
 
and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

nor have the knowledge of the holy. 
4  Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? 
 
Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? 
 
Who hath bound the waters in a garment? 
 
Who hath established all the ends of the earth? 
 
What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell? 
 
5  Every word of God is pure:
