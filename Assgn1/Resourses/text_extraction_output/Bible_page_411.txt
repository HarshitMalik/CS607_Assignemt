  412    Deuteronomy 2 
23  and the Avim which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the 
Caphtorim, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and 
dwelt in their stead.) 
24  Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: 
 
behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of 
Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him 
 
in battle. 
25  This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee 
upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear 
report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 
Israel Conquers Sihon 
26  Â¶ And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto 
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
27  Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will 
 
neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
28  Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me 
 
water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my 
 
feet: 
 
29  (as the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites 
which dwell in Ar, did unto me:) until I shall pass over Jordan into 
 
the land which the Lord our God giveth us. 
30  But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the 
 
Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, 
that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. 
31  And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon 
and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit 
 
his land. 
32  Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at 
Jahaz. 
33  And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote 
 
him, and his sons, and all his people.
