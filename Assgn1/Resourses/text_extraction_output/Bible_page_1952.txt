  1953    Micah 2 
11  Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: 
 
the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-
ezel; he shall receive of you his standing. 
 
12  For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil 
 
came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem. 
13  O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: 
 
she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the 
 
transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 
14  Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses 
 
of Achzib [a lie] shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. 
15  Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he 
 
shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. 
16  Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy 
 
baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. 
 
2 
Woe to Those Who Oppress the Poor 
1  Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! 
 
when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the 
power of their hand. 
2  And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and 
 
take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man 
 
and his heritage. 
3  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I 
 
devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither 
 
shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. 
 
4  In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with 
a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath 
 
changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from 
 
me! turning away he hath divided our fields. 
 
5  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the 
congregation of the Lord.
