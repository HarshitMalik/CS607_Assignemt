  409    Deuteronomy 1 
God’s Punishment on Israel 
34  ¶ And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and 
sware, saying, 
35  Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see 
that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,  
36  save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I 
 
give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, 
because he hath wholly followed the Lord. 
37  Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also 
shalt not go in thither. 
38  But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go 
in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
   
39  Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your 
children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and 
evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they 
shall possess it. 
40  But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness 
by the way of the Red sea. 
The Defeat of Israel at Hormah 
41  ¶ Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 
Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our 
God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his 
weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. 
42  And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither 
fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your 
   
enemies. 
43  So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the 
 
commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the 
hill. 
44  And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against 
you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even 
unto Hormah.
