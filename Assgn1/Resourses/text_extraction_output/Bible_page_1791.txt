  1792    Ezekiel 20 
by reason of many waters. 
11  And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, 
and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, 
and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 
12  But she was plucked up in fury, 
she was cast down to the ground, 
and the east wind dried up her fruit: 
 
her strong rods were broken and withered; 
 
the fire consumed them. 
13  And now she is planted in the wilderness, 
in a dry and thirsty ground. 
14  And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, 
which hath devoured her fruit, 
so that she hath no strong rod 
to be a sceptre to rule. 
¶ This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of 
Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, 
when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your 
God;
