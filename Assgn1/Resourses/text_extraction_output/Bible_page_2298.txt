  2299    John 19 
15  But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. 
Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests 
 
answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
16  Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And 
they took Jesus, and led him away. 
The Crucifixion 
17  ¶ And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of 
a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: 
 
18  where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side 
one, and Jesus in the midst. 
19  And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing 
was, Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. 
20  This title then read many of the Jews; for the place where Jesus was 
 
crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and 
 
Greek, and Latin. 
21  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The 
King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
 
22  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. 
23  ¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his 
garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his 
 
coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top 
 
throughout. 
24  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast 
lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, 
 
which saith, 
They parted my raiment among them, 
and for my vesture they did cast lots.  
These things therefore the soldiers did. 
25  ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his 
mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 
26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, 
whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
