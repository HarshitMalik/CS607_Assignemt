  1883    Daniel 5 
36  At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of 
 
my kingdom, mine honor and brightness returned unto me; and 
 
my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established 
 
in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. 
37  Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of 
heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and 
 
those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

The Handwriting on the Wall 
1  Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, 
and drank wine before the thousand. 
2  ¶ Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the 
golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had 
taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and 
 
his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink therein. 
3  Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the 
temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king 
 
and his princes, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. 
4  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of 
brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
5  ¶ In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote 
over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the 
king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
 
6  Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts 
troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his 
knees smote one against another. 
7  The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and 
the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of 
Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the 
interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a 
chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the 
kingdom.
