  255    Leviticus 13 
11  it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall 
pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is 
 
unclean. 
12  And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover 
all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his 
foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 
 
13  then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have 
 
covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the 
plague: it is all turned white: he is clean. 
   
14  But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 
15  And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be 
unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy. 
   
16  Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall 
come unto the priest; 
 
17  and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned 
 
into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the 
 
plague: he is clean. 
 
18  ¶ The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and 
is healed, 
19  and in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, 
white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest; 
 
20  and if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the 
skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall 
 
pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the 
 
boil. 
21  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs 
therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; 
 
then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 
 
22  and if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall 
pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. 
 
23  But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning 
boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 
 
24  ¶ Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, 
and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat 
reddish, or white;
