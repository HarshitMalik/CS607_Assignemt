  2056    Matthew 16 
15  He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 
 
16  And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
of the living God.  
17  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
 
Father which is in heaven. 
18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I 
will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against 
 
it. 
19  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and 
 
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and 
 
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
20  Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he 
was Jesus the Christ. 
Jesus Foretells His Death 
21  ¶ From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, how 
that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the 
elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised 
again the third day. 
22  Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far 
from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. 
 
23  But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: 
 
thou art an offense unto me: for thou savorest not the things that 
 
be of God, but those that be of men. 
24  ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, 
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  
25  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will 
 
lose his life for my sake shall find it.  
26  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and 
lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his 
 
soul? 
 
27  For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his 
angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
