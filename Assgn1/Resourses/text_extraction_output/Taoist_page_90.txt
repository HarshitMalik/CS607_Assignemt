As the universal principle of constant renewal of life is

Those who speak sparely and are quiet live long.
All  this  is  because  warmth  and  gentility,  kindness  and
decency,  breadth  of  mind,  cordiality  with  dignity,  and
taciturnity  are  all  aspects  of  humanity—it  is  fitting  that
they would foster longevity.
Liuquan’s  statement  has  one  aspect  of  humanity,  yet
even  that  can  foster  longevity.  What  about  the  extended
longevity  of  one  who  embodies  all  of  these  qualities
together!
