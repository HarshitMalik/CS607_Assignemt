  657    1 Samuel 17 
23  And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, 
that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was 
 
refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

David Kills Goliath 
1  Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and 
were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and 
pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
2  And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched 
by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the 
Philistines. 
3  And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel 
stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley 
 
between them. 
4  And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, 
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
5  And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with 
a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels 
 
of brass. 
6  And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass 
between his shoulders. 
7  And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s 
 
head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield 
 
went before him. 
8  And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto 
them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a 
 
Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and 
 
let him come down to me. 
9  If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your 
servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be 
 
our servants, and serve us.
