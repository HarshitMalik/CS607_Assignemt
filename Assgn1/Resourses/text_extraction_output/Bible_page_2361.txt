  2362    Acts 19 
21  ¶ After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when 
he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, 
saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
22  So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, 
Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. 
 
The Riot at Ephesus 
23  ¶ And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. 
24  For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made 
silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; 
 
25  whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and 
said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. 
26  Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost 
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away 
much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with 
hands: 
 
27  so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but 
 
also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, 
and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the 
world worshippeth. 
28  ¶ And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and 
cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
29  And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught 
 
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in 
travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater. 
30  And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the 
disciples suffered him not. 
31  And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto 
him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the 
theater. 
32  Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the 
 
assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore 
 
they were come together.
