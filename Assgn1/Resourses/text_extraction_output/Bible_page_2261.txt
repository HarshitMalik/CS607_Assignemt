  2262    John 7 
5  For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
6  Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time 
 
is always ready. 
7  The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, 
 
that the works thereof are evil. 
8  Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time 
   
is not yet full come. 
9  When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. 
Jesus at the Feast of Tabernacles 
10  ¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto 
the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
11  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
 
12  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning 
him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he 
     
deceiveth the people. 
13  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
14  ¶ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, 
and taught. 
15  And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, 
having never learned? 
 
16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his 
that sent me. 
17  If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 
18  He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that 
 
seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no 
unrighteousness is in him. 
19  Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the 
law? Why go ye about to kill me? 
   
20  The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about 
 
to kill thee? 
 
21  Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye 
all marvel.
