  1836    Ezekiel 36 
28  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye 
 
shall be my people, and I will be your God.  
29  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for 
 
the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. 
30  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the 
field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the 
heathen. 
31  Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that 
were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for 
your iniquities and for your abominations. 
32  Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto 
you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of 
 
Israel. 
33  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; In the day that I shall have cleansed 
 
you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the 
cities, and the wastes shall be builded. 
34  And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the 
sight of all that passed by. 
35  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the 
garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are 
 
become fenced, and are inhabited. 
36  Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I 
the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I 
 
the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. 
37  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the 
 
house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like 
 
a flock. 
38  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so 
 
shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall 
 
know that I am the Lord.
