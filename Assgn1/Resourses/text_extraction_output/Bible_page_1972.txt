Zephaniah 
[Zephaniah] 
1 
The Day of the Lord’s Wrath 
1  The word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of 
Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, 
in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. 
2  ¶ I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the Lord. 
3  I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the 
 
heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the 
wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord. 
 
4  I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal 
 
from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; 
 
5  and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and 
 
them that worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by 
Malcham; 
 
6  and them that are turned back from the Lord; and those that have 
 
not sought the Lord, nor inquired for him. 
7  ¶ Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of 
 
the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he 
 
hath bid his guests. 
8  And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I 
will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as are 
clothed with strange apparel. 
9  In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the 
threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and 
deceit. 
10  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there 
shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a howling from the 
second, and a great crashing from the hills.
