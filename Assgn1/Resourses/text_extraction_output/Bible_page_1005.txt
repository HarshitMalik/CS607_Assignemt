Micaiah Prophesies the Defeat of Ahab and Jehoshaphat 
1  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined 
affinity with Ahab. 
2  And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And 
Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the 
people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him 
to Ramoth-gilead. 
3  And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt 
thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as 
 
thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in 
 
the war. 
4  ¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, 
at the word of the Lord today. 
5  Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four 
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to 
battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver 
   
it into the king’s hand. 
6  But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord 
besides, that we might inquire of him? 
 
7  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, 
by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never 
   
prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the 
 
son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
8  And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch 
quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. 
9  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of 
them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void 
place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets 
 
prophesied before them. 
10  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, 
and said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt push Syria 
until they be consumed.
