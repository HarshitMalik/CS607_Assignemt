  2187    Luke 9 
Who Is the Greatest? 
 
46  ¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should 
be greatest.  
47  And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and 
set him by him, 
48  and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name 
receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that 
 
sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. 
 
He That Is Not against Us Is for Us 
49  ¶ And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out 
devils in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not 
 
with us. 
50  And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against 
 
us is for us. 
Jesus Rebukes James and John 
51  ¶ And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be 
received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
52  and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered 
 
into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
53  And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he 
would go to Jerusalem. 
54  And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, 
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and 
consume them, even as Elijah did? 
 
55  But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what 
manner of spirit ye are of. 
56  For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save 
them. And they went to another village.
