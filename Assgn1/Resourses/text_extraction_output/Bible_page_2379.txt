  2380    Acts 26 
25  But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, 
and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined 
to send him. 
26  Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore 
I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O 
king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat 
to write. 
27  For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not 
withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

Paul’s Defense before Agrippa 
1  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for 
thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for 
himself: 
 
2  ¶ I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for 
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am 
accused of the Jews: 
 
3  especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and 
questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to 
 
hear me patiently. 
4  ¶ My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among 
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
 
5  which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after 
the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  
6  And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made 
of God unto our fathers: 
 
7  unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and 
night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am 
accused of the Jews. 
8  Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God 
should raise the dead?
