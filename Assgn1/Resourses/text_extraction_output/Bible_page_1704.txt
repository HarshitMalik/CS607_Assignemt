  1705    Jeremiah 41 
dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well 
with you.  
10  As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, 
which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer 
 
fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities 
that ye have taken. 
11  Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the 
Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard 
that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he 
had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 
 
12  even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were 
driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, 
and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. 
Ishmael’s Conspiracy against Gedaliah 
13  ¶ Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the 
forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
14  and said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of 
the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay 
thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 
 
15  Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah 
secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the 
son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he 
 
slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be 
scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish? 
 
16  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of 
Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of 
 
Ishmael. 
41 
1  Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of 
Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of 
the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of
