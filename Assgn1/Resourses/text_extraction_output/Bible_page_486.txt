  487    Deuteronomy 32 
and there was no strange god with him. 
13  He made him ride on the high places of the earth, 
that he might eat the increase of the fields; 
 
and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, 
and oil out of the flinty rock; 
 
14  butter of kine, and milk of sheep, 
with fat of lambs, 
and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, 
with the fat of kidneys of wheat; 
 
and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. 
15  But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: 
 
thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, 
thou art covered with fatness; 
 
then he forsook God which made him, 
and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
16  They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, 
with abominations provoked they him to anger. 
17  They sacrificed unto devils, not to God;  
 
to gods whom they knew not, 
to new gods that came newly up, 
whom your fathers feared not. 
18  Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, 
and hast forgotten God that formed thee. 
19  And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, 
because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 
20  And he said, I will hide my face from them, 
I will see what their end shall be: 
 
for they are a very froward generation, 
children in whom is no faith. 
21  They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; 
 
they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: 
 
and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; 
 
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  
22  For a fire is kindled in mine anger, 
and shall burn unto the lowest hell,
