18  of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
   
19  and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
   
20  of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

22  ¶ The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and 
Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the 
 
reign of Darius the Persian. 
23  The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book 
of the Chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of 
Eliashib. 
24  And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the 
 
son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise 
and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the 
man of God, ward over against ward. 
25  Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, 
were porters keeping the ward at the threshholds of the gates. 
26  These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of 
Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the 
priest, the scribe. 
The Dedication of the Wall 
27  ¶ And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the 
Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep 
the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with 
singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
28  And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out 
of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages 
of Netophathi; 
 
29  also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and 
Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about 
 
Jerusalem. 
30  And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified 
the people, and the gates, and the wall.
