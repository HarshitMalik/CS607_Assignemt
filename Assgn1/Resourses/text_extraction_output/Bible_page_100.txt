  101    Genesis 41 
44  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee 
shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 
45  And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave 
 
him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And 
Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 
46  ¶ And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh 
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, 
and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
47  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by 
handfuls. 
48  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in 
the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the 
 
field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
49  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until 
he left numbering; for it was without number. 
 
50  ¶ And unto Joseph were born two sons, before the years of famine 
came: which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare 
 
unto him. 
51  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh [forgetting]: 
 
For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my 
father’s house. 
52  And the name of the second called he Ephraim [fruitful]: For God 
 
hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. 
53  ¶ And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of 
Egypt, were ended. 
54  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph 
had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of 
   
Egypt there was bread. 
55  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to 
Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go 
 
unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.  
 
56  And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph 
 
opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the 
 
famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
