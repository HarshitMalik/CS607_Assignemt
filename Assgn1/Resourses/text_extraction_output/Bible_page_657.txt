  658    1 Samuel 17 
10  And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me 
 
a man, that we may fight together. 
11  When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they 
were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
12  ¶ Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, 
whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went 
   
among men for an old man in the days of Saul. 
13  And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the 
battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were 
 
Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third 
Shammah. 
14  And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. 
 
15  But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at 
Bethlehem. 
16  And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented 
himself forty days. 
17  ¶ And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an 
ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the 
camp to thy brethren; 
 
18  and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and 
look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
19  ¶ Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of 
Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
20  And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a 
keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he 
 
came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and 
shouted for the battle. 
21  For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army 
against army. 
22  And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the 
carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
23  And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, 
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the 
Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David 
 
heard them.
