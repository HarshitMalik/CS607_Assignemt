  2343    Acts 13 
8  But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) 
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
9  Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set 
his eyes on him, 
10  and said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the 
devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to 
pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
 
11  And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt 
be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there 
fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some 
 
to lead him by the hand. 
12  Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being 
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. 
Paul and Barnabas at Antioch of Pisidia 
13  ¶ Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came 
to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to 
 
Jerusalem. 
14  But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in 
Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat 
down. 
15  And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the 
synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have 
any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 
16  Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, 
¶ Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. 
17  The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the 
people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with 
a high arm brought he them out of it.  
18  And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the 
wilderness.  
19  And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, 
he divided their land to them by lot.
