BHAGAVAD GITA
Anishtamishtam mishram cha trividham karmanah phalam;
Bhavatyatyaaginaam pretya na tu sannyaasinaam kwachit.
12. The threefold fruit of action—evil, good and mixed—accrues after death to the
non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners.
Panchaitaani mahaabaaho kaaranaani nibodha me;
Saankhye kritaante proktaani siddhaye sarvakarmanaam.
13. Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes, as declared in the Sankhya
system for the accomplishment of all actions!
Adhishthaanam tathaa kartaa karanam cha prithagvidham;
Vividhaashcha prithakcheshtaa daivam chaivaatra panchamam.
14. The body, the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various sorts, and the
presiding Deity, also, the fifth,
Shareeravaangmanobhiryat karma praarabhate narah;
Nyaayyam vaa vipareetam vaa panchaite tasya hetavah.
15. Whatever action a man performs by his body, speech and mind, whether right or the
reverse, these five are its causes.
Tatraivam sati kartaaram aatmaanam kevalam tu yah;
Pashyatyakritabuddhitwaan na sa pashyati durmatih.
16. Now, such being the case, he who, owing to untrained understanding, looks upon his
Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence, sees not.
Yasya naahankrito bhaavo buddhiryasya na lipyate;
Hatwaapi sa imaam llokaan na hanti na nibadhyate.
17. He who is ever free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted by (good
or evil), though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action).
Jnaanam jneyam parijnaataa trividhaa karmachodanaa;
Karanam karma karteti trividhah karmasangrahah.
18. Knowledge, the knowable and the knower form the threefold impulse to action; the
organ, the action and the agent form the threefold basis of action.
Jnaanam karma cha kartaa cha tridhaiva gunabhedatah;
Prochyate gunasankhyaane yathaavacchrinu taanyapi.
