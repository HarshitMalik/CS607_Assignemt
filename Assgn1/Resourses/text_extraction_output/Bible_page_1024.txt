  1025    2 Chronicles 26 
3  Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he 
reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also 
was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
4  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according 
to all that his father Amaziah did. 
5  And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had 
understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the 
 
Lord, God made him to prosper. 
6  ¶ And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake 
down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of 
Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 
7  And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the 
Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunim. 
8  And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread 
 
abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself 
 
exceedingly. 
9  Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and 
at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. 
10  Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he 
 
had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains; 
 
husbandmen also, and vinedressers in the mountains, and in 
Carmel: for he loved husbandry. 
 
11  Moreover Uzziah had a host of fighting men, that went out to war 
by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of 
Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of 
Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. 
12  The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of 
valor were two thousand and six hundred. 
13  And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and 
seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty 
power, to help the king against the enemy. 
14  And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and 
spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast 
stones.
