  179    Exodus 23 
19  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the 
house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his 
mother’s milk.  
The Lord’s Angel Sent to Lead Israel 
20  ¶ Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and 
to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 
21  Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will 
 
not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. 
 
22  ¶ But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; 
 
then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto 
thine adversaries. 
23  ¶ For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the 
Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, 
the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off. 
 
24  Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do 
after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite 
 
break down their images. 
25  And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, 
and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 
 
26  There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: 
 
the number of thy days I will fulfil. 
27  I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to 
whom thou shalt come; and I will make all thine enemies turn 
 
their backs unto thee. 
28  And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the 
Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 
29  I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land 
 
become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 
30  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou 
be increased, and inherit the land. 
31  And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the 
Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
