This is Nanak‟s prayer, O Lord, that he may join and merge with the Saadh Sangat, the 
Company of the Holy.  || 2 || 3 || 43 ||

Love of the enticing Beloved Lord is the most glorious love. Meditate, O mind, on the 
One Lord of the Universe — nothing else is of any account. Attach your mind to the 
Saints, and abandon the path of duality.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is absolute and 
unmanifest;  He  has  assumed  the  most  sublime  manifestation.  He  has  fashioned 
countless body chambers of many, varied, different, myriad forms. Within them, the 
mind is the policeman; my Beloved lives in the temple of my inner self. He plays there 
in  ecstasy.  He does not die, and he never grows  old.  || 1 ||   He is engrossed in 
worldly activities, wandering around in various ways. He steals the property of others, 
and  is  surrounded  by  corruption  and  sin.  But  now,  he  joins  the  Saadh  Sangat,  the 
Company of the Holy, and stands before the Lord‟s Gate. He obtains the Blessed Vision 
of the Lord‟s Darshan. Nanak has met the Guru; he shall not be reincarnated again.  || 
2 || 1 || 44 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Lord has made this world a stage; He 
fashioned the expanse of the entire creation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He fashioned it in 
various ways, with limitless colors and forms. He watches over it with joy, and He never 
tires of enjoying it. He enjoys all the delights, and yet He remains unattached.  || 1 ||   
He has no color, no sign, no mouth and no beard. I cannot describe Your play. Nanak is 
the dust of the feet of the Saints.  || 2 || 2 || 45 ||   SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have 
come to You. I have come to Your Sanctuary. I have come to place my faith in You. I 
have come seeking Mercy. If it pleases You, save me, O my Lord and Master. The Guru 
has placed me upon the Path.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Maya is very treacherous and difficult 
to pass through. It is like a violent wind-storm.  || 1 ||   I am so afraid to hear that the 
Righteous Judge of Dharma is so strict and stern.  || 2 ||   The world is a deep, dark 
pit; it is all on fire.  || 3 ||   I have grasped the Support of the Holy Saints. Nanak 
meditates on the Lord. Now, I have found the Perfect Lord.  || 4 || 3 || 46 ||    
RAAG SOOHEE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SIXTH HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
I offer this prayer to the True Guru, to bless me with the sustenance of the Naam. 
When the True King is pleased, the world is rid of its diseases.  || 1 ||   You are the 
Support of Your devotees, and the Shelter of the Saints, O True Creator Lord.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   True are Your devices, and True is Your Court. True are Your treasures, and 
True  is  Your  expanse.    ||  2  ||      Your  Form  is  inaccessible,  and  Your  Vision  is 
incomparably beautiful.
