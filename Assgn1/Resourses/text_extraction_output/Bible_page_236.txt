  237    Leviticus 6 
15  If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy 
things of the Lord; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the 
 
Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation 
by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass 
offering: 
 
16  and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the 
holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the 
priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the 
 
ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him. 
17  Â¶ And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are 
forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though 
 
he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
18  And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy 
estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest 
 
shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance 
wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him. 
19  It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the 
 
Lord. 
6 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and lie unto 
his neighbor in that which was delivered him to keep, or in 
fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived 
his neighbor; 
 
3  or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and 
sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning 
 
therein: 
 
4  then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall 
restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he 
hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or 
the lost thing which he found, 
5  or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore 
 
it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and
