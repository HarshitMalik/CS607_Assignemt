The Epistle of Paul to 
Titus 
[Titus] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to 
the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which 
is after godliness; 
 
2  in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before 
the world began; 
 
3  but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, 
which is committed unto me according to the commandment of 
God our Saviour; 
 
4  ¶ To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: 
 
¶ Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus 
Christ our Saviour. 
Qualifications of Elders and Bishops 
5  ¶ For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order 
the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had 
appointed thee: 
 
6  if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful 
children not accused of riot or unruly. 
7  For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-
 
willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to 
filthy lucre; 
 
8  but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, 
temperate; 
 
9  holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may 
be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the 
gainsayers.
