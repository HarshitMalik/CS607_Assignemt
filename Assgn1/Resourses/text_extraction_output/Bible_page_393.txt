  394    Numbers 32 
18  We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel 
have inherited every man his inheritance: 
 
19  for we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or 
forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan 
 
eastward. 
20  And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go 
armed before the Lord to war, 
21  and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord, until he 
hath driven out his enemies from before him, 
22  and the land be subdued before the Lord: then afterward ye shall 
 
return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this 
 
land shall be your possession before the Lord. 
23  But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord: 
 
and be sure your sin will find you out. 
24  Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and 
 
do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 
25  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto 
Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 
26  Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be 
there in the cities of Gilead: 
 
27  but thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the 
Lord to battle, as my lord saith. 
28  Â¶ So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and 
Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the 
children of Israel: 
 
29  and Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children 
of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to 
battle, before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you; 
 
then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
 
30  but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have 
possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
31  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, 
saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
