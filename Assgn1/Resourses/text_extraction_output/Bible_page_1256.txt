  1257    Psalms 44 
and hast scattered us among the heathen. 
12  Thou sellest thy people for nought, 
and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. 
13  Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, 
a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. 
14  Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, 
a shaking of the head among the people. 
15  My confusion is continually before me, 
and the shame of my face hath covered me, 
16  for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; 
 
by reason of the enemy and avenger. 
17  All this is come upon us; 
 
yet have we not forgotten thee, 
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 
18  Our heart is not turned back, 
neither have our steps declined from thy way; 
 
19  though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, 
and covered us with the shadow of death. 
20  If we have forgotten the name of our God, 
or stretched out our hands to a strange god; 
 
21  shall not God search this out? 
 
For he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
22  Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; 
 
we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.  
23  Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? 
 
Arise, cast us not off for ever. 
24  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, 
and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 
 
25  For our soul is bowed down to the dust: 
 
our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 
26  Arise for our help, 
and redeem us for thy merciesâ€™ sake.
