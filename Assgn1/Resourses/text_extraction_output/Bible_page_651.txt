  652    1 Samuel 15 
51  And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was 
 
the son of Abiel. 
52  ¶ And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: 
 
and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took 
him unto him.

Saul’s Disobedience and Rejection 
1  Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be 
king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto 
 
the voice of the words of the Lord. 
2  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to 
Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from 
Egypt.  
3  Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, 
and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and 
 
suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 
4  ¶ And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in 
Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of 
Judah. 
5  And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. 
6  And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from 
among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed 
 
kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of 
Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
7  And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to 
Shur, that is over against Egypt. 
8  And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly 
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
9  But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and 
of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was 
good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was 
 
vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
