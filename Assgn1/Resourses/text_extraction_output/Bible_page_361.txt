  362    Numbers 21 
The Israelites Journey around Moab 
10  ¶ And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 
11  And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the 
wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. 
12  From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 
13  From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of 
Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of 
the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and 
 
the Amorites. 
14  Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, 
What he did in the Red sea, 
and in the brooks of Arnon, 
15  and at the stream of the brooks 
that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, 
and lieth upon the border of Moab. 
16  ¶ And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the 
 
Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will 
give them water. 
17  Then Israel sang this song, 
Spring up, O well; 
 
sing ye unto it: 
 
18  the princes digged the well, 
the nobles of the people digged it, 
by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. 
And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: 
 
19  and from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 
   
20  and from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to 
the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. 
Israel Conquers Sihon 
21  ¶ And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, 
saying,
