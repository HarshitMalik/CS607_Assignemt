  504    Joshua 6 
12  And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the 
old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any 
 
more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 
 
Joshua and the Man with a Drawn Sword 
13  ¶ And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up 
his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against 
him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, 
 
and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
 
14  And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now 
 
come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and 
said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? 
 
15  And the captain of the Lord’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy 
shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. 
 
And Joshua did so.

The Fall of Jericho 
1  Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: 
 
none went out, and none came in. 
2  And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand 
Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor. 
3  And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about 
the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
4  And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ 
horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, 
 
and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
5  And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the 
ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the 
people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall 
 
fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight 
before him.
