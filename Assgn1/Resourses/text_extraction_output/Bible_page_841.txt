Elisha’s Miracles for the Prophets 
38  ¶ And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the 
 
land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he 
   
said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for 
the sons of the prophets. 
39  And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild 
vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and 
shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. 
 
40  So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they 
were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man 
of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. 
41  But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he 
 
said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no 
harm in the pot. 
42  ¶ And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man 
of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears 
of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that 
they may eat. 
43  And his servitor said, What, should I set this before a hundred 
men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus 
   
saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. 
44  So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according 
to the word of the Lord.

The Cure of Naaman’s Leprosy 
1  Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great 
man with his master, and honorable, because by him the Lord had 
given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, 
 
but he was a leper.
