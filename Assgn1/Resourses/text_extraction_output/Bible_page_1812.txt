  1813    Ezekiel 27 
7  Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou 
spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of 
 
Elishah was that which covered thee. 
8  The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise 
 
men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots. 
9  The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy 
calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to 
 
occupy thy merchandise. 
10  ¶ They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy 
men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set 
   
forth thy comeliness. 
11  The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round 
about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: they hanged their 
 
shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty 
 
perfect. 
12  ¶ Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind 
of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 
 
13  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded 
 
the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 
14  They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and 
horsemen and mules. 
15  The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the 
 
merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present, horns 
 
of ivory and ebony. 
16  Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of 
thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and 
 
broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 
17  Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded 
 
in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, 
and balm. 
18  Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy 
making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and 
 
white wool. 
19  Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright 
 
iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.
