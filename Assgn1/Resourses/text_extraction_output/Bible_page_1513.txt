  1514    Isaiah 12 
12 
The Lord to Be Praised in That Day 
1  And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee: though 
 
thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou 
comfortedst me. 
2  ¶ Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for 
   
the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become 
 
my salvation.  
3  ¶ Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of 
salvation. 
4  And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, 
declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name 
is exalted. 
5  Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is 
   
known in all the earth. 
6  Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy 
 
One of Israel in the midst of thee.

The Oracle concerning Babylon 
1  The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 
2  ¶ Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto 
them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the 
nobles. 
3  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my 
mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. 
4  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; 
 
a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: 
 
the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
