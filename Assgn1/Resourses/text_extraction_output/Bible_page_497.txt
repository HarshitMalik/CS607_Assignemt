  498    Joshua 2 
14  And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this 
our business. And it shall be, when the Lord hath given us the 
land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. 
15  ¶ Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her 
 
house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 
16  And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers 
meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers 
 
be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
 
17  And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath 
which thou hast made us swear. 
18  Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of 
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and 
 
thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and 
all thy father’s household, home unto thee. 
19  And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy 
house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be 
guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood 
 
shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. 
20  And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine 
oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
21  And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent 
them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the 
 
window. 
22  ¶ And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there 
three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers 
 
sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. 
23  So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and 
passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all 
things that befell them: 
 
24  and they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath delivered into our 
hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do 
 
faint because of us.
