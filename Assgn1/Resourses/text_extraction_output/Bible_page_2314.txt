  2315    Acts 4 
26  Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to 
bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. 
4 
Peter and John before the Council 
1  And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of 
the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 
2  being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through 
Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
3  And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next 
day: for it was now eventide. 
 
4  Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the 
 
number of the men was about five thousand. 
5  Â¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, 
and scribes, 
6  and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, 
and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were 
gathered together at Jerusalem. 
7  And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what 
power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
 
8  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of 
the people, and elders of Israel, 
9  if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent 
man, by what means he is made whole; 
 
10  be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the 
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God 
raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before 
you whole. 
11  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is 
become the head of the corner.  
12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other 
 
name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
