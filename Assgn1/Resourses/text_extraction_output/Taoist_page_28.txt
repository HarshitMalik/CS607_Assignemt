SUFFERING
Simply  because  they  cannot  get  rid  of  one  thing,  namely
craving, people crave fame and profit and become bound
by fame and profit; they crave wine and flesh and become
bound  by  wine  and  flesh;  they  crave  status  and  prestige
and  become  bound  by  status  and  prestige;  they  crave
children and grandchildren and become bound by children
and grandchildren. They bind up the true nature in all sorts
of mixed-up ways, coming and going in the human world
subject to unlimited suffering.
A  fetus  develops  from  the  combination  of  the  sperm
from  the  father  and  the  ovum  from  the  mother.  The
amniotic sac is like a prison, constricting the body. When
the  mother  eats  something  hot,  it  is  like  boiling  water  is
being  poured  on  the  body  of  the  fetus;  when  the  mother
eats something cold, it is like ice is being pressed against
its body. When the energy is full and the fetus is complete,
it urgently wants to get out; but it must first break through
the sac. It takes a few days for the water to break: people
only  know  of  the  suffering  of  the  mother’s  labor  pains—
they do not know that the infant suffers even more. Only at
parturition,  when  it  cries  out,  are  the  sufferings  in  the
womb over.
Then there are sufferings affecting the whole body that
subsequently  come  along.  Inwardly  there  are  hunger  and
thirst, outwardly there are cold and heat; fevers and rashes
occur  one  after  another.  These  are  the  sufferings  of
childhood.
