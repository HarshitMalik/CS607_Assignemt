  2215    Luke 18 
27  They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in 
marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the 
flood came, and destroyed them all.  
28  Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, 
 
they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
 
29  but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and 
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. 
30  Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
31  In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in 
the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in 
 
the field, let him likewise not return back.  
32  Remember Lotâ€™s wife.  
33  Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever 
 
shall lose his life shall preserve it.  
34  I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one 
 
shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 
35  Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and 
 
the other left. 
36  Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other 
 
left. 
37  And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said 
 
unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be 
gathered together.

The Parable of the Widow and the Judge 
1  And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought 
always to pray, and not to faint; 
 
2  saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither 
regarded man: 
 
3  and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, 
 
Avenge me of mine adversary.
