Supreme  sincerity  can  move  heaven  and  earth  and
summon  ghosts  and  spirits.  Ghosts  and  spirits  appear
everywhere  between  heaven  and  earth;  though  people  do
not  see  ghosts  and  spirits,  they  do  see  heaven  and  earth.
Ghosts  and  spirits  are  souls  of  heaven  and  earth,  heaven
and earth are tracks of ghosts and spirits.
Cultivated people fear the order of heaven; this is why
they  fear  ghosts  and  spirits.  Worldly  people  dare  to  do
what  is  not  good  because  they  only  fear  that  people  will
know.  Those  who  are  afraid  of  other  people  knowing  are
hypocrites;  they  are  small  people.  Those  who  fear
Heavenâ€™s knowing are sincere; they are cultured people.
FAMILIAL DUTY
Familial duty is the root of a hundred practices, the basis
of  myriad  virtues.  Establishing  yourself  and  carrying  out
the  Way  constitute  lifetime  familial  duty.  Working  to
provide support is familial duty for one time. If with every
step  you  take,  every  word  you  utter,  every  thought  you
conceive,  you  dare  not  forget  your  parents  and  do  not
make the mistake of disgracing yourself, losing your mind,
or shaming your parents, that can be called familial duty.
If  with  every  step,  every  word,  and  every  thought,  you
dare  not  disobey  heaven  and  earth  and  do  not  disgrace
yourself,  lose  your  mind,  or  violate  principle,  this  can  be
called humanity.
