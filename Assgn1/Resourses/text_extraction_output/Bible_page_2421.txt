  2422    Romans 16 
12  Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the 
beloved Persis, which labored much in the Lord. 
13  Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
14  Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the 
brethren which are with them. 
15  Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, 
and all the saints which are with them. 
16  Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute 
you. 
17  ¶ Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions 
and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and 
 
avoid them. 
18  For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their 
own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts 
 
of the simple. 
19  For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore 
on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is 
 
good, and simple concerning evil. 
20  And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. 
21  ¶ Timothy my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, 
my kinsmen, salute you. 
22  ¶ I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. 
23  ¶ Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus 
the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. 
24  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
