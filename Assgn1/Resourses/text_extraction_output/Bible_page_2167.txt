  2168    Luke 5 
15  But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great 
 
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their 
infirmities. 
16  And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. 
Jesus Heals a Palsied Man 
17  Â¶ And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that 
there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were 
come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and 
 
the power of the Lord was present to heal them. 
18  And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a 
palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before 
 
him. 
19  And when they could not find by what way they might bring him 
in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let 
him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before 
Jesus. 
20  And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are 
forgiven thee. 
21  And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is 
this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God 
 
alone? 
 
22  But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto 
them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
 
23  whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up 
 
and walk? 
 
24  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth 
to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, 
Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. 
25  And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that 
whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
26  And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled 
with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
