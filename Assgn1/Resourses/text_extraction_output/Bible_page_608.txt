  609    Judges 21 
21 
Wives for the Benjamites 
1  Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall 
not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
2  And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even

women and the children. 
11  And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every 
male, and every woman that hath lain by man. 
12  And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four
