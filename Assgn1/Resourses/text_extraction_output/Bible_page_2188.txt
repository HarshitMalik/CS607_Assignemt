  2189    Luke 10 
8  And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such 
things as are set before you: 
 
9  and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom 
of God is come nigh unto you. 
10  But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your 
ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 
11  Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe 
off against you: notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the 
 
kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  
12  But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for 
Sodom, than for that city.  
Woes to Unrepentant Cities 
13  ¶ Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the 
   
mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been 
done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in 
sackcloth and ashes. 
14  But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, 
than for you. 
15  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust 
down to hell.  
16  ¶ He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you 
 
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. 
 
The Return of the Seventy 
17  ¶ And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the 
devils are subject unto us through thy name. 
18  And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from 
heaven. 
19  Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, 
and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any 
 
means hurt you.
