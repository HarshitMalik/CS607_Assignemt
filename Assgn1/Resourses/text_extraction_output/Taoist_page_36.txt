use  the  intellect,  you  can  be  spontaneous  with  clear
awareness.”
Also, “People’s feelings are easily aroused and hard to
control,  but  anger  is  the  worst.  If  you  can  immediately
forget your anger when angered and observe what is right
and  wrong  in  principle,  you  can  also  see  how  external
seductions are not worthy of aversion, and furthermore be
halfway along the Way.”
Master  Zhu  said,  “Forget  anger  and  you  will  be
impartial;  see  what  is  true  and  you  will  follow  it.  These
two  are  means  of  returning  to  yourself  and  getting  rid  of
blindness.”  People  who  attain  the  Way  are  empty  and
silent  inside  and  out.  In  the  midst  of  quietude  they  look
within:  realizing  there  is  no  thing  at  all,  while  physically
within the circle they mentally transcend things.
THINKING
The  human  mind  should  be  mortified,  while  its  potential
should  be  vivified.  Mortification  means  causing  its
desirous thoughts to die out; vivification means enlivening
its  reason.  Thinking  is  the  living  potential  of  the  mind.
Freedom  from  error  is  the  overall  principle;  the  nine
thoughts  are  the  specific  principles—thinking  how  to  see
clearly, thinking how to hear keenly, thinking how to make
a  warm  impression,  thinking  how  to  be  respectful  in
demeanor, thinking how to be truthful in speech, thinking
how to be serious in work, thinking how to pose questions
