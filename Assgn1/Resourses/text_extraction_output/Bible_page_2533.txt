  2534    1 Timothy 5 
11  But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax 
 
wanton against Christ, they will marry; 
 
12  having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
13  And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to 
house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking 
 
things which they ought not. 
14  I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, 
guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak 
reproachfully. 
15  For some are already turned aside after Satan. 
16  If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve 
them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them 
 
that are widows indeed. 
17  ¶ Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, 
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine. 
18  For the Scripture saith, 
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox 
that treadeth out the corn.  
And, 
The laborer is worthy of his reward.  
19  Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three 
witnesses.  
20  Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. 
21  I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect 
angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one 
before another, doing nothing by partiality. 
22  Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s 
sins: keep thyself pure. 
 
23  ¶ Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake 
and thine often infirmities. 
24  ¶ Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; 
 
and some men they follow after. 
25  Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and 
 
they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
