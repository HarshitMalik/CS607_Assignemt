  1884    Daniel 5 
8  Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the 
 
writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. 
9  Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance 
was changed in him, and his lords were astonished. 
10  ¶ Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, 
came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O 
 
king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy 
 
countenance be changed: 
 
11  there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy 
gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and 
 
wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the 
 
king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made 
master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; 
 
12  forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and 
understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard 
sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, 
whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and 
 
he will show the interpretation. 
13  ¶ Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake 
and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the 
children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father 
brought out of Jewry? 
 
14  I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and 
that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. 
15  And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before 
me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me 
the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the 
 
interpretation of the thing: 
 
16  and I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and 
dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make 
 
known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with 
scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the 
third ruler in the kingdom.
