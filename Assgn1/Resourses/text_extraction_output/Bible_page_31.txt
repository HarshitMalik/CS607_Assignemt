  32    Genesis 15 
22  And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand 
unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and 
earth, 
23  that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I 
will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have 
made Abram rich: 
 
24  save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of 
the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them 
 
take their portion.

A Son Promised to Abram 
1  After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a 
vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding 
 
great reward. 
2  And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go 
childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 
 
3  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, 
 
one born in my house is mine heir. 
4  And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This 
shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine 
 
own bowels shall be thine heir. 
5  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward 
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he 
 
said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  
6  And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for 
 
righteousness.  
7  Â¶ And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur 
of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 
8  And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit 
it?
