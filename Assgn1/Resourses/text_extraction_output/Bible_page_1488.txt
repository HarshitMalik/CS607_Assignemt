  1489    Song of Solomon 7 
yea, the queens and the concubines, 
and they praised her. 
10  Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, 
fair as the moon, clear as the sun, 
and terrible as an army with banners? 
 
11  I went down into the garden of nuts 
to see the fruits of the valley, 
and to see whether the vine flourished, 
and the pomegranates budded. 
12  Or ever I was aware, 
my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. 
13  Return, return, O Shulamite; 
 
return, return, that we may look upon thee. 
What will ye see in the Shulamite? 
 
As it were the company of two armies.

1  How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O princeâ€™s daughter! 
 
The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, 
the work of the hands of a cunning workman. 
2  Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: 
 
thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
3  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 
4  Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; 
 
thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, 
by the gate of Bath-rabbim: 
 
thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon 
which looketh toward Damascus. 
5  Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, 
and the hair of thine head like purple; 
 
the King is held in the galleries. 
6  How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
 
7  This thy stature is like to a palm tree, 
and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
