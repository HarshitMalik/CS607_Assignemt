  593    Judges 15 
7  And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I 
be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 
8  And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he 
 
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 
Samson Defeats the Philistines at Lehi 
9  ¶ Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread 
themselves in Lehi. 
10  And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And 
 
they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he

15  And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and 
took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. 
16  And Samson said, 
With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, 
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. 
17  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he 
cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
