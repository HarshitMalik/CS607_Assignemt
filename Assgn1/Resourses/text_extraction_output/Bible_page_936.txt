  937    1 Chronicles 14 
8  And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and 
with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with 
timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
9  ¶ And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza 
put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
 
10  And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and he smote 
him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before 
 
God. 
11  And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach 
upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza [the breach of 
 
Uzza] to this day. 
12  And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the 
ark of God home to me? 
 
13  So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, 
but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
14  And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his 
house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-
edom, and all that he had.

Hiram’s Recognition of David 
1  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of 
cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house. 
2  And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over 
Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people 
Israel. 
David’s Children Born at Jerusalem 
3  ¶ And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more 
 
sons and daughters. 
4  Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; 
 
Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
