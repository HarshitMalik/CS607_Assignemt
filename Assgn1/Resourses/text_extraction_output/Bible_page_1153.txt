  1154    Job 15 
yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 
16  How much more abominable and filthy is man, 
which drinketh iniquity like water? 
 
17  I will show thee, hear me; 
 
and that which I have seen I will declare; 
 
18  which wise men have told from their fathers, 
and have not hid it: 
 
19  unto whom alone the earth was given, 
and no stranger passed among them. 
20  The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, 
and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
21  A dreadful sound is in his ears: 
 
in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 
22  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, 
and he is waited for of the sword. 
23  He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? 
 
He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
24  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; 
 
they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
25  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, 
and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 
26  He runneth upon him, even on his neck, 
upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 
 
27  because he covereth his face with his fatness, 
and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. 
28  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, 
and in houses which no man inhabiteth, 
which are ready to become heaps. 
29  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, 
neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 
30  He shall not depart out of darkness; 
 
the flame shall dry up his branches, 
and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 
31  Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: 
 
for vanity shall be his recompense.
