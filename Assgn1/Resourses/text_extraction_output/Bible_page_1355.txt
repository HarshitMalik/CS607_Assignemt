  1356    Psalms 114 
praise the name of the Lord. 
2  Blessed be the name of the Lord 
from this time forth and for evermore. 
3  From the rising of the sun 
unto the going down of the same 
the Lordâ€™s name is to be praised. 
4  The Lord is high above all nations, 
and his glory above the heavens. 
5  Who is like unto the Lord our God, 
who dwelleth on high, 
6  who humbleth himself to behold 
the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 
 
7  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, 
and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 
 
8  that he may set him with princes, 
even with the princes of his people. 
9  He maketh the barren woman to keep house, 
and to be a joyful mother of children. 
Praise ye the Lord.

The Wonders of the Exodus 
1  When Israel went out of Egypt,  
the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
 
2  Judah was his sanctuary, 
and Israel his dominion. 
3  The sea saw it, and fled:  
 
Jordan was driven back.  
4  The mountains skipped like rams, 
and the little hills like lambs. 
5  What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? 
 
thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 
 
6  ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams;
