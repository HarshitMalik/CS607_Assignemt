Nebuchadrezzar’s Care for Jeremiah 
11  ¶ Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning 
Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, 
12  Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto

Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of

and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of 
Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the 
 
people.

16  Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the 
Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words

18  For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, 
but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy 
 
trust in me, saith the Lord.
