  838    2 Kings 3 
18  And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord: he will deliver 
 
the Moabites also into your hand. 
19  And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall 
fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good 
piece of land with stones. 
20  And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was 
offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and 
the country was filled with water. 
21  Â¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to 
fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on 
armor, and upward, and stood in the border. 
22  And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the 
water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as 
blood: 
 
23  and they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they 
 
have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. 
 
24  And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up 
and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they 
 
went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. 
25  And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast 
every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of 
 
water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they 
 
the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it. 
 
26  And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for 
him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to 
break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not. 
 
27  Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, 
and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was 
great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and 
 
returned to their own land.
