  743    2 Samuel 20 
20 
The Revolt of Sheba 
1  And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was 
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and 
 
said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the 
son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.  
 
2  So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed 
Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, 
 
from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
3  ¶ And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the 
 
ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, 
and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So 
they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in 
widowhood. 
4  ¶ Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah 
within three days, and be thou here present. 
5  So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer 
 
than the set time which he had appointed him. 
6  And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us 
more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and 
 
pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. 
7  And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and 
the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of 
 
Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
8  When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went 
before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded 
unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins 
in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 
 
9  And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab 
 
took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him. 
10  But Amasa took no heed of the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he 
 
smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the 
ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
