  1413    Proverbs 7 
26  For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of 
bread: 
 
and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
27  Can a man take fire in his bosom, 
and his clothes not be burned? 
 
28  Can one go upon hot coals, 
and his feet not be burned? 
 
29  So he that goeth in to his neighborâ€™s wife; 
 
whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 
30  Men do not despise a thief, 
if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 
 
31  but if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; 
 
he shall give all the substance of his house. 
32  But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh 
understanding: 
 
he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
33  A wound and dishonor shall he get; 
 
and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 
34  For jealousy is the rage of a man: 
 
therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 
35  He will not regard any ransom; 
 
neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.

The Wiles of a Harlot 
1  My son, keep my words, 
and lay up my commandments with thee. 
2  Keep my commandments, and live; 
 
and my law as the apple of thine eye. 
3  Bind them upon thy fingers, 
write them upon the table of thine heart. 
4  Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; 
 
and call understanding thy kinswoman:
