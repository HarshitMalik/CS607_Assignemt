  267    Leviticus 16 
12  and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the 
altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten 
small, and bring it within the veil: 
 
13  and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the 
cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the 
testimony, that he die not: 
 
14  and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with 
his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat 
 
shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 
15  ¶ Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the 
people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood 
as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the 
mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 
 
16  and he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the 
uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their 
transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle 
 
of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of 
their uncleanness. 
17  And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation 
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he 
come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his 
household, and for all the congregation of Israel. 
18  And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord, and 
make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the 
 
bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of 
the altar round about. 
19  And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven 
times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the 
children of Israel. 
20  ¶ And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and 
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the 
live goat: 
 
21  and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, 
and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and 
all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head
