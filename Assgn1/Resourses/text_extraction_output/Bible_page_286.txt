  287    Leviticus 24 
The Showbread 
5  ¶ And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two 
 
tenth deals shall be in one cake. 
6  And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure 
table before the Lord.  
7  And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be 
on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the 
Lord. 
8  Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, 
being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 
9  And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the 
 
holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord 
 
made by fire by a perpetual statute. 
The Punishment for Blasphemy 
10  ¶ And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an 
Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of 
 
the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the 
camp; 
 
11  and the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord, 
and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s 
 
name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 
 
12  and they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be 
showed them. 
13  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
14  Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that 
 
heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the 
congregation stone him. 
15  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, 
Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
16  And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be 
put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as
