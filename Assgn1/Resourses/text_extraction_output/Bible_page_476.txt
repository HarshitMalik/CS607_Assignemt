  477    Deuteronomy 28 
55  so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children 
whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, 
 
and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in 
all thy gates. 
56  The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not 
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for 
delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the 
husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her 
daughter, 
57  and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, 
and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat 
 
them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, 
wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. 
58  Â¶ If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are 
written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful 
name, The Lord thy God; 
 
59  then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of 
thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore 
sicknesses, and of long continuance. 
60  Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which 
thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 
 
61  Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the 
book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou 
be destroyed. 
62  And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of 
heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of 
 
the Lord thy God. 
63  And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do 
you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to 
 
destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked 
 
from off the land whither thou goest to possess it. 
64  And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one 
end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve 
 
other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even 
wood and stone.
