  84    Genesis 35 
35 
God Blesses Jacob at Beth-el 
1  And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: 
 
and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when 
thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
2  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, 
Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and 
change your garments: 
 
3  and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar 
 
unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was 
with me in the way which I went. 
4  And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their 
hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid 
 
them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
5  ¶ And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities 
 
that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons 
of Jacob. 
6  So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-
el, he and all the people that were with him. 
7  And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el [the God 
of Beth-el]; because there God appeared unto him, when he fled 
 
from the face of his brother. 
8  But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath 
Beth-el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth 
 
[the oak of weeping]. 
9  ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-
aram, and blessed him. 
10  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be 
 
called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called 
 
his name Israel. 
11  And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and 
 
multiply: a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and 
 
kings shall come out of thy loins;
