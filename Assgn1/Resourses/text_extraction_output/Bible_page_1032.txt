  1033    2 Chronicles 29 
began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by 
David king of Israel. 
28  And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the 
trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering 
 
was finished. 
29  And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that 
were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. 
30  Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the 
Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David, and 
of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they 
bowed their heads and worshipped. 
31  Â¶ Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated 
yourselves unto the Lord, come near and bring sacrifices and 
thank offerings into the house of the Lord. And the congregation 
brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a 
 
free heart, burnt offerings. 
32  And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation 
brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two 
hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord. 
 
33  And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three 
thousand sheep. 
34  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the 
burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help 
 
them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had 
sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to 
 
sanctify themselves than the priests. 
35  And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the 
peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So 
the service of the house of the Lord was set in order. 
36  And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared 
the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
