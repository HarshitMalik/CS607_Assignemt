I  offer  this  one  prayer  to  You;  please  listen  to  it,  O  Creator  Lord.  You  are  true, great, 
merciful  and  spotless,  O  Cherisher  Lord.    ||  1  ||      The  world  is  a  transitory  place  of 
mortality — know this for certain in your mind. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, has 
caught me by the hair on my head, and yet, I do not know it at all in my mind.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   Spouse, children, parents and siblings — none of them will be there to hold your 
hand. And when at last I fall, and the time of my last prayer has come, there shall be no 
one to rescue me.  || 2 ||   Night and day, I wandered around in greed, contemplating evil 
schemes. I never did good deeds; this is my condition.  || 3 ||   I am unfortunate, miserly, 
negligent, shameless and without the Fear of God. Says Nanak, I am Your humble servant, 
the dust of the feet of Your slaves.  || 4 || 1 ||

The Fear of You, O Lord God, is my marijuana; my consciousness is the pouch which holds 
it. I have become an intoxicated hermit. My hands are my begging bowl; I am so hungry 
for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I beg at Your Door, day after day.  || 1 ||   I long 
for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I am a beggar at Your Door — please bless me with 
Your charity.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Saffron, flowers, musk oil and gold embellish the bodies of 
all. The Lord‟s devotees are like sandalwood, which imparts its fragrance to everyone.  || 2 
||   No one says that ghee or silk are polluted. Such is the Lord‟s devotee, no matter what 
his  social  status  is.  Those  who  bow  in  reverence  to  the  Naam,  the  Name  of  the  Lord, 
remain absorbed in Your Love. Nanak begs for charity at their door.  || 3 || 1 || 2 ||
