12  and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things 
faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei 
 
his brother was the next. 
13  And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, 
and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, 
were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, 
at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler 
of the house of God. 
14  And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, 
was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of 
the Lord, and the most holy things. 
15  And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and 
Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in 
their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the 
great as to the small: 
 
16  besides their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, 
even unto every one that entereth into the house of the Lord, his 
daily portion for their service in their charges according to their 
courses; 
 
17  both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, 
and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges 
by their courses; 
 
18  and to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their 
sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their 
 
set office they sanctified themselves in holiness: 
 
19  also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the 
suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were 
expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the 
priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the 
Levites. 
20  Â¶ And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that 
which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God. 
21  And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, 
and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did 
it with all his heart, and prospered.
