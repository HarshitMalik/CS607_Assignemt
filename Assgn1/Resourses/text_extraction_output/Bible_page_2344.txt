  2345    Acts 13 
34  And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no 
more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, 
I will give you the sure mercies of David.  
35  Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, 
Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  
36  For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of 
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw 
corruption: 
 
37  but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. 
38  Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through 
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: 
 
39  and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which 
ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
40  Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in 
the prophets; 
 
41  Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: 
 
for I work a work in your days, 
a work which ye shall in no wise believe, 
though a man declare it unto you.  
42  ¶ And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles 
besought that these words might be preached to them the next 
sabbath. 
43  Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and 
religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to 
 
them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 
44  ¶ And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to 
hear the word of God. 
45  But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, 
and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, 
contradicting and blaspheming. 
46  Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that 
the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye 
 
put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, 
lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
47  For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying,
