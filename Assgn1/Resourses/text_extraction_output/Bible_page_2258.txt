  2259    John 6 
29  Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye 
believe on him whom he hath sent. 
30  They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then, that 
we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? 
   
31  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave 
 
them bread from heaven to eat.  
32  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses 
gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the 
 
true bread from heaven. 
33  For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and 
giveth life unto the world. 
34  Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
35  ¶ And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh 
 
to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never 
 
thirst. 
36  But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 
37  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that 
 
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 
38  For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the 
will of him that sent me. 
39  And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which 
he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again 
at the last day. 
40  And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth 
the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will 
 
raise him up at the last day. 
41  ¶ The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread 
which came down from heaven. 
42  And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and 
mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from 
 
heaven? 
 
43  Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among 
yourselves. 
44  No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me 
draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
