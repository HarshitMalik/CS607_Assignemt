  413    Deuteronomy 3 
34  And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the 
men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none 
to remain: 
 
35  only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of 
the cities which we took. 
36  From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from 
the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city 
too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us: 
   
37  only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor 
unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the 
mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbade us.

Israel Conquers Og of Bashan 
1  Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king 
 
of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at 
Edrei. 
2  And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, 
 
and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do 
 
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which 
dwelt at Heshbon. 
3  So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of 
Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to 
 
him remaining. 
4  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which 
we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, 
the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
5  All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside 
 
unwalled towns a great many. 
6  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of 
Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of 
every city.
