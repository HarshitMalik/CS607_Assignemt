  2079    Matthew 24 
The Coming of the Son of Man 
29  ¶ Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be 
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall 
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 
 
30  and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and 
 
then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the 
Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great 
glory. 
31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and 
they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one 
end of heaven to the other. 
32  ¶ Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet 
 
tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: 
 
33  so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is 
near, even at the doors. 
34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these 
things be fulfilled. 
35  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass 
away. 
No Man Knoweth the Day and Hour 
36  ¶ But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of 
heaven, but my Father only. 
37  But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of 
man be. 
38  For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and 
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah 
entered into the ark, 
39  and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so 
 
shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
40  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other 
 
left.
