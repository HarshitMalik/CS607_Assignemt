  342    Numbers 14 
13  ¶ And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, 
(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among 
them;) 
 
14  and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have 
 
heard that thou Lord art among this people, that thou Lord art 
seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that 
thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud, and in a 
pillar of fire by night. 
15  Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations 
which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 
16  Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land 
which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the 
wilderness. 
17  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, 
according as thou hast spoken, saying, 
18  The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity 
and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the 
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth 
generation.  
19  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto 
the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, 
from Egypt even until now.  
God’s Punishment on Israel 
20  ¶ And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 
 
21  but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the 
Lord. 
22  Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, 
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me 
now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
 
23  surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, 
neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
