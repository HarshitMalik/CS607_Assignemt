  155    Exodus 13 
8  And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because 
of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of 
Egypt. 
9  And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a 
memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord’s law may be in thy 
mouth: for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of 
 
Egypt. 
10  Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to 
year. 
11  ¶ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of 
the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall 
give it thee, 
12  that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, 
and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the male 
 
shall be the Lord’s. 
13  And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if 
 
thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the 
 
firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. 
14  And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, 
What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the 
 
Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
 
15  and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the 
Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn 
of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord 
 
all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my 
 
children I redeem. 
16  And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets 
between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us 
 
forth out of Egypt. 
The Pillar of Cloud and the Pillar of Fire 
17  ¶ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that 
God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,
