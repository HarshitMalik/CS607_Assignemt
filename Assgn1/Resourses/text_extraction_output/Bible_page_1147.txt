and they shall not escape, 
and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

Job Affirms Godâ€™s Power and Wisdom 
1  And Job answered and said, 
2  No doubt but ye are the people, 
and wisdom shall die with you. 
3  But I have understanding as well as you; 
 
I am not inferior to you: 
 
yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 
 
4  I am as one mocked of his neighbor, 
who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: 
 
the just upright man is laughed to scorn. 
5  He that is ready to slip with his feet 
is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
6  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, 
and they that provoke God are secure; 
 
into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 
7  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; 
 
and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 
 
8  or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; 
 
and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 
9  Who knoweth not in all these 
that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? 
 
10  in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, 
and the breath of all mankind. 
11  Doth not the ear try words? 
 
and the mouth taste his meat? 
 
12  With the ancient is wisdom; 
 
and in length of days understanding. 
13  With him [God] is wisdom and strength, 
he hath counsel and understanding.
