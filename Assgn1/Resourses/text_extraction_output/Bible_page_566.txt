meet for the necks of them that take the spoil? 
 
31  So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: 
 
but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his 
might. 
¶ And the land had rest forty years.

The Call of Gideon 
1  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the 
 
Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 
2  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the 
 
Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in 
the mountains, and caves, and strongholds. 
3  And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, 
and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up 
against them; 
 
4  and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the 
earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, 
neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. 
5  For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as 
grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were 
 
without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. 
 
6  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and 
 
the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. 
7  ¶ And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the 
Lord because of the Midianites, 
8  that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which 
said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you 
up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 
 
9  and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the 
hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before 
you, and gave you their land;
