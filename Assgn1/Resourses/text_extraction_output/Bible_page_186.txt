  187    Exodus 27 
30  And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion 
thereof which was showed thee in the mount. 
31  ¶ And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and 
fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubim shall it be made. 
 
32  And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid 
with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of 
 
silver. 
33  And thou shalt hang up the veil under the taches, that thou mayest 
bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony: and the 
 
veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. 
34  And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in 
the most holy place. 
35  And thou shalt set the table without the veil, and the candlestick 
over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the 
south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side. 
 
36  ¶ And thou shalt make a hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, 
and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with 
needlework. 
37  And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, 
and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and 
 
thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them. 
27 
The Altar of Burnt Offering 
1  And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and 
five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height 
   
thereof shall be three cubits. 
2  And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: 
 
his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. 
 
3  And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, 
and his basins, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels 
 
thereof thou shalt make of brass.
