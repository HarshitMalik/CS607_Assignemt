The Third Epistle of 
John 
[3 John] 
1 
Salutation 
1  The elder unto the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. 
2  ¶ Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be 
in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
3  For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the 
truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
4  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. 
Gaius’ Hospitality Commended 
5  ¶ Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the 
brethren, and to strangers; 
 
6  which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom 
 
if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt 
do well: 
 
7  because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of 
the Gentiles. 
8  We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers 
to the truth. 
The Opposition of Diotrephes 
9  ¶ I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the 
 
preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 
10  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, 
prating against us with malicious words: and not content 
 
therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and 
forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.
