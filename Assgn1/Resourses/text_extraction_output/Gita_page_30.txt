BHAGAVAD GITA
24. Being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna, having stationed that best of chariots, O
Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies,
Bheeshmadronapramukhatah sarveshaam cha maheekshitaam;
Uvaacha paartha pashyaitaan samavetaan kuroon iti.
25. In front of Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: “O Arjuna, behold
now all these Kurus gathered together!”
Tatraapashyat sthitaan paarthah pitrin atha pitaamahaan;
Aachaaryaan maatulaan bhraatrun putraan pautraan sakheemstathaa.
26. Then Arjuna beheld there stationed, grandfathers and fathers, teachers, maternal uncles,
brothers, sons, grandsons and friends, too.
Shvashuraan suhridashchaiva senayorubhayorapi;
Taan sameekshya sa kaunteyah sarvaan bandhoon avasthitaan.
Kripayaa parayaa’vishto visheedannidam abraveet;
27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both armies. The son of
Kunti—Arjuna—seeing all these kinsmen standing arrayed, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with
deep pity.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Drishtwemam swajanam krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam.
Arjuna said:
28. Seeing these, my kinsmen, O Krishna, arrayed, eager to fight,
Seedanti mama gaatraani mukham cha parishushyati;
Vepathushcha shareere me romaharshashcha jaayate.
29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched up, my body quivers and my hairs stand on end!
Gaandeevam sramsate hastaat twak chaiva paridahyate;
Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum bhramateeva cha me manah.
30. The (bow) “Gandiva” slips from my hand and my skin burns all over; I am unable even
to stand, my mind is reeling, as it were.
Nimittaani cha pashyaami vipareetaani keshava;
Na cha shreyo’nupashyaami hatwaa swajanam aahave.
31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava! I do not see any good in killing my kinsmen in
battle.
