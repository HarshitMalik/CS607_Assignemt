  520    Joshua 11 
7  So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them 
by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 
 
8  And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote 
them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-
maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote 
 
them, until they left them none remaining. 
9  And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed 
 
their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 
10  ¶ And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote 
the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head 
 
of all those kingdoms. 
11  And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the 
sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: 
   
and he burnt Hazor with fire. 
12  And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did 
Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he 
utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord 
commanded. 
13  But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned 
none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. 
 
14  And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel 
took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with 
 
the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left 
they any to breathe. 
15  As the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses 
command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all 
 
that the Lord commanded Moses. 
Joshua Takes the Whole Land 
16  ¶ So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, 
and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the 
mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
