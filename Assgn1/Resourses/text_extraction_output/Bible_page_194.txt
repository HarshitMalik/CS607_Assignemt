  195    Exodus 29 
25  And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon 
the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor before the Lord: it 
 
is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
26  ¶ And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s consecration, 
and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord: and it shall be thy 
 
part. 
27  And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the 
shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is 
heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for 
Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 
 
28  and it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’ by a statute for ever from the 
children of Israel; for it is a heave offering: and it shall be a heave 
   
offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace 
offerings, even their heave offering unto the Lord. 
29  ¶ And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to be 
anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 
30  And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, 
when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to 
minister in the holy place. 
31  ¶ And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his 
flesh in the holy place. 
32  And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread 
that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
33  And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was 
made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not 
 
eat thereof, because they are holy. 
34  And if aught of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, 
remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder 
with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 
 
35  ¶ And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to 
all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou 
 
consecrate them.
