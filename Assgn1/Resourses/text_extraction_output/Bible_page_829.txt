  830    1 Kings 22 
33  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived 
that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from 
pursuing him. 
34  And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of 
Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the 
 
driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the 
host; for I am wounded. 
 
35  And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his 
 
chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out 
 
of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 
36  And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the 
going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every 
man to his own country. 
37  ¶ So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried 
 
the king in Samaria. 
38  And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs 
 
licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according unto the 
   
word of the Lord which he spake. 
39  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory 
house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
40  So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his 
 
stead. 
The Reign of Jehoshaphat 
41  ¶ And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the 
fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
42  Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; 
 
and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his 
mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
43  And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside 
 
from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: 
 
nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people 
 
offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
