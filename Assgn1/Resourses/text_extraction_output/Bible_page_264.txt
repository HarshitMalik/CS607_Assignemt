  265    Leviticus 15 
22  And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
23  And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when 
he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. 
24  And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he 
shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall 
 
be unclean. 
25  ¶ And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the 
time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her 
separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as 
 
the days of her separation: she shall be unclean. 
 
26  Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto 
her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon 
 
shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 
27  And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until 
the even. 
28  But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself 
seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 
29  And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two 
young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation. 
30  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for 
a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her 
 
before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness. 
31  ¶ Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their 
uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they 
 
defile my tabernacle that is among them. 
32  ¶ This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed 
goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 
 
33  and of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, 
of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that 
is unclean.
