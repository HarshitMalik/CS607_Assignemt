  2209    Luke 15 
14  And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that 
land; and he began to be in want. 
 
15  And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he 
 
sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
16  And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the 
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. 
 
17  And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants 
of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with 
hunger! 
 
18  I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I 
have sinned against heaven, and before thee, 
19  and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy 
 
hired servants. 
20  And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great 
way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell 
on his neck, and kissed him. 
21  And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, 
and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 
22  But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and 
put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 
   
23  and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be 
 
merry: 
 
24  for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is 
 
found. And they began to be merry. 
25  ¶ Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh 
 
to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
26  And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things 
meant. 
27  And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath 
 
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
28  And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father 
 
out, and entreated him. 
29  And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve 
thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment; and yet
