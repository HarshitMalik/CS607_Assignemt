The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Galatians 
[Galatians] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, 
and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
 
2  and all the brethren which are with me. 
¶ Unto the churches of Galatia: 
 
3  ¶ Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our 
Lord Jesus Christ, 
4  who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this 
present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 
 
5  to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
There Is No Other Gospel 
6  ¶ I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you 
into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
 
7  which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and 
 
would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel 
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be 
accursed. 
9  As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other 
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 
10  ¶ For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? 
   
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
