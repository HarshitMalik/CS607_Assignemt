  1189    Job 36 
14  They die in youth, 
and their life is among the unclean. 
15  He delivereth the poor in his affliction, 
and openeth their ears in oppression. 
16  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait 
into a broad place, where there is no straitness; 
 
and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 
17  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: 
 
judgment and justice take hold on thee. 
18  Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: 
 
then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
19  Will he esteem thy riches? 
 
No, not gold, 
nor all the forces of strength. 
20  Desire not the night, 
when people are cut off in their place. 
21  Take heed, regard not iniquity: 
 
for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
22  Behold, God exalteth by his power: 
 
who teacheth like him? 
 
23  Who hath enjoined him his way? 
 
Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
 
24  Remember that thou magnify his work, 
which men behold. 
25  Every man may see it; 
 
man may behold it afar off. 
26  Behold, God is great, and we know him not, 
neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
27  For he maketh small the drops of water: 
 
they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof; 
 
28  which the clouds do drop 
and distil upon man abundantly. 
29  Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, 
or the noise of his tabernacle? 
 
30  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
