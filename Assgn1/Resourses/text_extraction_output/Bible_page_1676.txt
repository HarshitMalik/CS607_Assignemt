  1677    Jeremiah 30 
31  Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord 
concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath 
 
prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust 
in a lie: 
 
32  therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the 
 
Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among 
 
this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my 
 
people, saith the Lord; because he hath taught rebellion against 
 
the Lord. 
30 
The Return from Captivity Promised 
1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 
2  Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the 
words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. 
3  For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the 
captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the Lord: and I will 
 
cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and 
they shall possess it. 
4  ¶ And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel 
and concerning Judah. 
5  For thus saith the Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of 
 
fear, and not of peace. 
6  Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? 
 
wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a 
woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 
 
7  Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time 
   
of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. 
 
8  ¶ For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I 
will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and 
strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 
 
9  but they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, 
whom I will raise up unto them.
