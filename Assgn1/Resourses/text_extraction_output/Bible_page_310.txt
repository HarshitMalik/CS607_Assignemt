51  and Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto 
Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the Lord, as the 
Lord commanded Moses.

The Tasks Assigned to the Levites 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
2  Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, 
after their families, by the house of their fathers, 
3  from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that 
enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
4  This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of 
the congregation, about the most holy things. 
5  And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his 
sons, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark 
of testimony with it: 
 
6  and shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall 
spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves 
thereof. 
7  And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, 
and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and 
covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 
   
8  and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the 
same with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves 
thereof. 
9  And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the 
light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the 
oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 
 
10  and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of 
badgers’ skins, and shall put it upon a bar.
