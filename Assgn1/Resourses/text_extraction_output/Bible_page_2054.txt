  2055    Matthew 16 
3  And in the morning, It will be foul weather today: for the sky is red 
 
and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; 
 
but can ye not discern the signs of the times? 
 
4  A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there 
 
shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. 
And he left them, and departed. 
The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees 
5  ¶ And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had 
forgotten to take bread. 
6  Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of 
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 
7  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have 
taken no bread. 
8  Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, 
why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no 
bread? 
 
9  Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the 
five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
 
10  neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many 
baskets ye took up? 
 
11  How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you 
concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the 
Pharisees and of the Sadducees? 
 
12  Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the 
leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the 
Sadducees. 
Peter’s Confession 
13  ¶ When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked 
his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? 
 
14  And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elijah; 
   
and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
