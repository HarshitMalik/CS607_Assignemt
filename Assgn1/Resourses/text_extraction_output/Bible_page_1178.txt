  1179    Job 31 
and let others bow down upon her. 
11  For this is a heinous crime; 
 
yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
12  For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, 
and would root out all mine increase. 
13  If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, 
when they contended with me; 
 
14  what then shall I do when God riseth up? 
 
And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
 
15  Did not he that made me in the womb make him? 
 
And did not one fashion us in the womb? 
 
16  If I have withheld the poor from their desire, 
or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
 
17  or have eaten my morsel myself alone, 
and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 
 
18  (for from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, 
and I have guided her from my motherâ€™s womb;) 
 
19  if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, 
or any poor without covering; 
 
20  if his loins have not blessed me, 
and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
 
21  if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, 
when I saw my help in the gate: 
 
22  then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, 
and mine arm be broken from the bone. 
23  For destruction from God was a terror to me, 
and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 
24  If I have made gold my hope, 
or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 
 
25  if I rejoiced because my wealth was great, 
and because mine hand had gotten much; 
 
26  if I beheld the sun when it shined, 
or the moon walking in brightness; 
 
27  and my heart hath been secretly enticed, 
or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
