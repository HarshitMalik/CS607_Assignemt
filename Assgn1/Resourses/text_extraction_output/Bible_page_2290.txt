  2291    John 16 
14  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it 
 
unto you. 
15  All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he 
 
shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you. 
Sorrow to Turn into Joy 
16  Â¶ A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, 
 
and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. 
17  Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that 
he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a 
 
little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
   
18  They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we 
 
cannot tell what he saith. 
19  Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto 
them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, 
and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see 
 
me? 
 
20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but 
the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow 
 
shall be turned into joy. 
21  A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is 
come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth 
 
no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 
22  And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and 
 
your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. 
23  And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it 
you. 
24  Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall 
 
receive, that your joy may be full.
