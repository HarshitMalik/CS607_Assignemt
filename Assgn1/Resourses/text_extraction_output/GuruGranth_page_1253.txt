Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
Eating, drinking, laughing and sleeping, the mortal forgets about dying. Forgetting his 
Lord and Master, the mortal is ruined, and his life is cursed. He cannot remain forever.  
|| 1 ||   O mortal, meditate on the One Lord. You shall go  to your true home with 
honor.  || 1  Pause  ||   Those who serve You — what can they give You? They beg for 
and receive what cannot remain. You are the Great Giver of all souls; You are the Life 
within all living beings.  || 2 ||   The Gurmukhs meditate, and receive the Ambrosial 
Nectar; thus they become pure. Day and night, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, 
O mortal. It makes the filthy immacuate.  || 3 ||   As is the season, so is the comfort of 
the  body,  and  so  is  the  body  itself.  O  Nanak,  that  season  is  beautiful;  without  the 
Name, what season is it?  || 4 || 1 ||   MALAAR,  FIRST MEHL:  I offer prayers to my 
Beloved Guru, that He may unite me with my Husband Lord. I hear the thunder in the 
clouds, and my mind is cooled and soothed; imbued with the Love of my Dear Beloved, 
I sing His Glorious Praises.  || 1 ||   The rain pours down, and my mind is drenched 
with His Love. The drop of Ambrosial Nectar pleases my heart; the Guru has fascinated 
my mind, which is drenched in the sublime essence of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   
With intuitive peace and poise, the soul-bride is loved by her Husband Lord; her mind is 
pleased  and  appeased  by  the  Guru‟s  Teachings.  She  is  the  happy  soul-bride  of  her 
Husband Lord; her mind and body are filled with joy by His Love.  || 2 ||   Discarding 
her demerits, she becomes detached; with the Lord as her Husband, her marriage is 
eternal. She never suffers separation or sorrow; her Lord God showers her with His 
Grace.    ||  3  ||      Her  mind  is  steady  and  stable;  she  does  not  come  and  go  in 
reincarnation. She takes the Shelter of the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, chant 
the  Naam;  you  shall  be  accepted  as  the  true  soul-bride  of  the  Lord.    ||  4  ||  2  ||   
MALAAR,    FIRST  MEHL:    They  pretend  to  understand  the  Truth,  but  they  are  not 
satisfied by the Naam; they waste their lives in egotism.
