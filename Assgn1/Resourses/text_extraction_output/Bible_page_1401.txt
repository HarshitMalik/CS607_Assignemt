The Proverbs 
[Proverbs] 
1 
The Value of Proverbs 
1  The Proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 
 
2  To know wisdom and instruction; 
 
to perceive the words of understanding; 
 
3  to receive the instruction of wisdom, 
justice, and judgment, and equity; 
 
4  to give subtilty to the simple, 
to the young man knowledge and discretion. 
5  A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; 
 
and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 
 
6  to understand a proverb, and the interpretation; 
 
the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
7  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge:  
 
but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
Wisdomâ€™s Warning 
8  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, 
and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
 
9  for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, 
and chains about thy neck. 
10  My son, if sinners entice thee, 
consent thou not. 
11  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, 
let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 
 
12  let us swallow them up alive as the grave; 
 
and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 
 
13  we shall find all precious substance, 
we shall fill our houses with spoil:
