The Perfect Guru leads me to meet my Beloved; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Guru.  
|| 1 ||  Pause  ||   My body is overflowing with faults; how can I meet my Perfect 
Beloved?  || 2 ||   The virtuous ones obtain my Beloved; I do not have these virtues. 
How can I meet Him, O my mother?  || 3 ||   I am so tired of making all these efforts. 
Please protect Nanak, the meek one, O my Lord.  || 4 || 1 ||   WADAHANS,  FOURTH 
MEHL:  My Lord God is so beautiful, but I do not know His value. Abandoning my Lord 
God, I am entangled in duality.  || 1 ||   How can I meet with my Husband? I don‟t 
know. She who pleases her Husband Lord is a happy soul-bride. She meets with her 
Husband Lord — she is so wise.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am filled with faults; how can I 
find my Husband Lord? You have many loves, but I am not even in Your thoughts, O 
my Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   She who ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord is the good 
soul-bride. I don‟t have these virtues; what can I, the discarded bride, do?  || 3 ||   The 
soul-bride continually enjoys her Husband Lord forever. I have no good karma; will He 
ever hold me close in His embrace?  || 4 ||   You, O Husband Lord, are worthy, while I 
am unworthy. I am worthless; please forgive Nanak, the meek one.  || 5 || 2 ||    
 
WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Within my mind there is such a great yearning; how will I attain the Blessed Vision of 
the Lord‟s Darshan? I go and ask my True Guru; with the Guru‟s advice, I shall teach 
my foolish mind. The deluded mind is instructed in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and 
meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, one whom my Beloved blesses with 
His Glance of Grace, focuses his consciousness on the Lord‟s Feet.  || 1 ||   I dress 
myself in all sorts of robes for the sake of my Husband, so that my True Lord God will 
be pleased. But my Beloved Husband Lord does not even cast a glance in my direction; 
how can I be consoled? For His sake, I adorn myself with adornments, but my Husband 
is  imbued  with  another.  O  Nanak,  blessed,  blessed,  blessed  is  that  soul-bride,  who 
enjoys her True, Sublime Husband Lord.  || 2 ||   I go and ask the blessed, happy soul-
bride, “How did you attain Him — your Husband Lord, my God?” She answers, “My True 
Husband blessed me with His Glance of Grace; I abandoned the distinction between 
mine and yours. Dedicate everything — mind, body and soul to the Lord God; this is the 
way to meet Him, O sister.” If her God gazes upon her with favor, O Nanak, her light 
merges into the Light.  || 3 ||   I dedicate my mind and body to the one who brings me 
a message from my Lord God. I wave the fan over him every day, serve him and carry 
water for him.
