  2451    1 Corinthians 15 
15  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have 
 
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if 
 
so be that the dead rise not. 
16  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 
 
17  and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
 
18  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 
19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most 
miserable. 
20  ¶ But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits 
of them that slept. 
21  For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of 
the dead. 
22  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 
23  But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward 
   
they that are Christ’s at his coming. 
24  Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom 
to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and 
 
all authority and power. 
25  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  
26  The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 
27  For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, All 
things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which 
did put all things under him.  
28  And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son 
also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that 
God may be all in all. 
29  ¶ Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the 
dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 
   
30  and why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
 
31  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I 
die daily. 
32  If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, 
what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; 
   
for tomorrow we die.  
33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
