  1511    Isaiah 10 
17  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a 
flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one 
 
day; 
 
18  and shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, 
both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer 
 
fainteth. 
19  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may 
write them. 
20  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, 
and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again 
stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the Lord, the 
 
Holy One of Israel, in truth. 
21  The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the 
mighty God. 
22  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant 
of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with 
 
righteousness. 
23  For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even 
determined, in the midst of all the land.  
24  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, O my people that 
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee 
 
with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner 
of Egypt. 
25  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and 
mine anger in their destruction. 
26  And the Lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to 
the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon 
 
the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 
27  And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken 
away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the 
yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. 
28  ¶ He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath 
 
laid up his carriages: 
 
29  they are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at 
 
Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
