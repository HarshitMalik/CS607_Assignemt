Naam Dayv‟s Lord and Master has settled my inner conflicts. Drink in the sublime elixir 
of the Lord, O deceitful one.  || 3 || 4 ||   AASAA:  One who recognizes the Supreme 
Lord God, dislikes other desires. He focuses his consciousness on the Lord‟s devotional 
worship, and keeps his mind free of anxiety.  || 1 ||   O my mind, how will you cross 
over the world-ocean, if you are filled with the water of corruption? Gazing upon the 
falseness of Maya, you have gone astray, O my mind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have 
given me birth in the house of a calico-printer, but I have found the Teachings of the 
Guru. By the Grace of the Saint, Naam Dayv has met the Lord.  || 2 || 5 ||    
 
AASAA,  THE WORD OF THE REVEREND RAVI DAAS JEE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The deer, the fish, the bumble bee, the moth and the elephant are destroyed, each for 
a single defect. So the one who is filled with the five incurable vices — what hope is 
there for him?  || 1 ||   O Lord, he is in love with ignorance. His lamp of clear wisdom 
has grown dim.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The creeping creatures live thoughtless lives, and 
cannot  discriminate  between  good  and  evil.  It  is  so  difficult  to  obtain  this  human 
incarnation, and yet, they keep company with the low.  || 2 ||   Wherever the beings 
and  creatures  are,  they  are  born  according  to  the  karma  of  their  past  actions.  The 
noose of death is unforgiving, and it shall catch them; it cannot be warded off.  || 3 ||   
O servant Ravi Daas, dispel your sorrow and doubt, and know that Guru-given spiritual 
wisdom is the penance  of penances. O  Lord, Destroyer of the fears of Your humble 
devotees, make me supremely blissful in the end.  || 4 || 1 ||   AASAA:  Your Saints are 
Your body, and their company is Your breath of life. By the True Guru-given spiritual 
wisdom, I know the Saints as the gods of gods.  || 1 ||   O Lord, God of gods, grant me 
the Society of the Saints, the sublime essence of the Saints‟ conversation, and the Love 
of the Saints.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Character of the Saints, the lifestyle of the Saints, 
and the service of the servant of the Saints.  || 2 ||   I ask for these, and for one thing 
more — devotional worship, which shall fulfill my desires. Do not show me the wicked 
sinners.    ||  3  ||      Says  Ravi  Daas,  he  alone  is  wise,  who  knows  this:  there  is  no 
difference between the Saints and the Infinite Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   AASAA:  You are 
sandalwood, and I am the poor castor oil plant, dwelling close to you. From a lowly 
tree, I have become exalted; Your fragrance, Your exquisite fragrance now permeates 
me.    ||  1  ||      O  Lord,  I  seek  the  Sanctuary  of  the  company  of  Your  Saints;  I  am 
worthless, and You are so benevolent.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are the white and yellow 
threads of silk, and I am like a poor worm. O Lord, I seek to live in the Company of the 
Saints, like the bee with its honey.  || 2 ||   My social status is low, my ancestry is low, 
and my birth is low as well. I have not performed the service of the Lord, the Lord, says 
Ravi Daas the cobbler.  || 3 || 3 ||   AASAA:  What would it matter, if my body were cut 
into  pieces?  If  I  were  to  lose  Your  Love,  Lord,  then  Your  humble  servant  would  be 
afraid.  || 1 ||   Your lotus feet are the home of my mind. Drinking in Your Nectar, I 
have obtained the wealth of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||
