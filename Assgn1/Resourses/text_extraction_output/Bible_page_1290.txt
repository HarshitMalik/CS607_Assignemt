  1291    Psalms 69 
and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. 
23  Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; 
 
and make their loins continually to shake.  
24  Pour out thine indignation upon them, 
and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. 
25  Let their habitation be desolate; 
 
and let none dwell in their tents.  
26  For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; 
 
and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 
27  Add iniquity unto their iniquity: 
 
and let them not come into thy righteousness. 
28  Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,  
and not be written with the righteous. 
29  But I am poor and sorrowful: 
 
let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
30  I will praise the name of God with a song, 
and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 
31  This also shall please the Lord better than an ox 
or bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 
32  The humble shall see this, and be glad: 
 
and your heart shall live that seek God. 
33  For the Lord heareth the poor, 
and despiseth not his prisoners. 
34  Let the heaven and earth praise him, 
the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
35  For God will save Zion, 
and will build the cities of Judah: 
 
that they may dwell there, 
and have it in possession. 
36  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: 
 
and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
