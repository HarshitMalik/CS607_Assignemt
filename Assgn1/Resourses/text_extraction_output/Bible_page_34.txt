  35    Genesis 17 
14  Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi [the well of him that 
liveth and seeth me]: behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 
 
15  ¶ And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, 
 
which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
16  And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare 
Ishmael to Abram.

Circumcision the Sign of the Covenant 
1  And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord 
appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; 
 
walk before me, and be thou perfect. 
2  And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will 
multiply thee exceedingly. 
3  And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 
 
4  As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a 
father of many nations. 
5  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name 
shall be Abraham [father of a great multitude]; for a father of many 
 
nations have I made thee.  
6  And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of 
thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
7  And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed 
after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a 
God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. 
8  And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land 
wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an 
everlasting possession; and I will be their God. 
 
9  ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant 
therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 
10  This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and 
thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be 
 
circumcised.
