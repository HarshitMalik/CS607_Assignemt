  1100    Nehemiah 10 
36  Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest 
unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, 
behold, we are servants in it: 
 
37  and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set 
over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our 
 
bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great 
distress.
