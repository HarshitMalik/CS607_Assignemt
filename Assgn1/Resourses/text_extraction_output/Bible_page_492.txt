  493    Deuteronomy 33 
because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; 
 
and he came with the heads of the people, 
he executed the justice of the Lord, 
and his judgments with Israel. 
22  ¶ And of Dan he said, 
Dan is a lion’s whelp: 
 
he shall leap from Bashan. 
23  ¶ And of Naphtali he said, 
O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, 
and full with the blessing of the Lord, 
possess thou the west and the south. 
24  ¶ And of Asher he said, 
Let Asher be blessed with children; 
 
let him be acceptable to his brethren, 
and let him dip his foot in oil. 
25  Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; 
 
and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. 
26  There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, 
who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, 
and in his excellency on the sky. 
27  The eternal God is thy refuge, 
and underneath are the everlasting arms: 
 
and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; 
 
and shall say, Destroy them. 
28  Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: 
 
the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; 
 
also his heavens shall drop down dew. 
29  Happy art thou, O Israel: 
 
who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, 
the shield of thy help, 
and who is the sword of thy excellency! 
 
And thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; 
 
and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
