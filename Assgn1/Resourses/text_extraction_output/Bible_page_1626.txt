  1627    Jeremiah 7 
14  therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, 
wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to 
your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.  
15  And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your 
brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. 
16  ¶ Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor 
prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not 
 
hear thee. 
17  Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets 
of Jerusalem? 
 
18  The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the 
women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, 
and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may 
provoke me to anger. 
19  Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord: do they not provoke 
   
themselves to the confusion of their own faces? 
 
20  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my 
 
fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon 
beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the 
ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched. 
 
The Punishment for Judah’s Rebellion 
21  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt 
 
offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. 
22  For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day 
that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt 
offerings or sacrifices: 
 
23  but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I 
will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the 
 
ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. 
24  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the 
counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went 
backward, and not forward.
