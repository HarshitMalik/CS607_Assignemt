  1812    Ezekiel 27 
shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the 
 
ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at 
thee. 
17  And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How 
art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the 
renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her 
inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it! 
 
18  Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that 
 
are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.  
19  Â¶ For thus saith the Lord God; When I shall make thee a desolate 
 
city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the 
 
deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; 
 
20  when I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, 
with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of 
the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the 
pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of 
 
the living; 
 
21  I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be 
 
sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord 
God. 
27 
1  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
2  Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 
 
3  and say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, 
which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the 
Lord God; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty. 
 
4  Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected 
thy beauty. 
5  They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have 
 
taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 
6  Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of 
 
the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the 
isles of Chittim.
