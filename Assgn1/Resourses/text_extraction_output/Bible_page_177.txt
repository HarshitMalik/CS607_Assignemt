  178    Exodus 23 
7  Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous 
 
slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 
 
8  And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and 
 
perverteth the words of the righteous.  
9  ¶ Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a 
 
stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.  
10  ¶ And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the 
fruits thereof: 
 
11  but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor 
 
of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field 
 
shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and 
with thy oliveyard.  
12  ¶ Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou 
shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy 
 
handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 
13  And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make 
 
no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of 
thy mouth. 
The Three Appointed Feasts 
14  ¶ Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 
15  Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat 
 
unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time 
appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: 
   
and none shall appear before me empty:) 
 
16  and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors, which thou 
hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the 
 
end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the 
field.  
17  Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord 
God. 
18  ¶ Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened 
bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the 
 
morning.
