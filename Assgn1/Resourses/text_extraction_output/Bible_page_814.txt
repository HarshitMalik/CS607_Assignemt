  815    1 Kings 18 
9  And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy 
servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
 
10  As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, 
whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He 
 
is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they 
 
found thee not. 
11  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. 
12  And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the 
Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so 
 
when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay 
me: but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth. 
 
13  Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets 
of the Lord, how I hid a hundred men of the Lord’s prophets by 
fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
 
14  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and 
 
he shall slay me. 
15  And Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I 
will surely show myself unto him today. 
16  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to 
 
meet Elijah. 
17  ¶ And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto 
him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? 
 
18  And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy 
 
father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the 
Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim. 
19  Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount 
Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the 
prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table. 
The Contest on Mount Carmel 
20  ¶ So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the 
prophets together unto mount Carmel.
