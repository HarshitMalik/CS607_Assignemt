  1136    Job 5 
an image was before mine eyes, 
there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 
17  Shall mortal man be more just than God? 
 
Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 
 
18  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; 
 
and his angels he charged with folly: 
 
19  how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, 
whose foundation is in the dust, 
which are crushed before the moth? 
 
20  They are destroyed from morning to evening: 
 
they perish for ever without any regarding it. 
21  Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? 
 
They die, even without wisdom.

1  Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; 
 
and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 
 
2  For wrath killeth the foolish man, 
and envy slayeth the silly one. 
3  I have seen the foolish taking root: 
 
but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
4  His children are far from safety, 
and they are crushed in the gate, 
neither is there any to deliver them. 
5  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, 
and taketh it even out of the thorns, 
and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
6  Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, 
neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 
 
7  yet man is born unto trouble, 
as the sparks fly upward. 
8  I would seek unto God, 
and unto God would I commit my cause: 
 
9  which doeth great things and unsearchable;
