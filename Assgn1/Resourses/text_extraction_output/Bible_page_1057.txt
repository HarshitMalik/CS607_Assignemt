children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the 
 
daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their

genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as 
 
polluted, put from the priesthood. 
63  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the

Thummim.  
64  ¶ The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand 
three hundred and threescore, 
65  besides their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven 
thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among 
 
them two hundred singing men and singing women. 
66  Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two

67  their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand 
 
seven hundred and twenty.

and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of 
silver, and one hundred priests’ garments. 
70  ¶ So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the 
singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, 
and all Israel in their cities.
