  1851    Ezekiel 42 
walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table 
 
that is before the Lord. 
23  And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
24  And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves 
 
for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. 
25  And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, 
cherubim and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and 
 
there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. 
26  And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and 
on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side 
chambers of the house, and thick planks.

1  Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the 
north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against 
 
the separate place, and which was before the building toward the 
north. 
2  Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the 
breadth was fifty cubits. 
3  Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and 
over against the pavement which was for the outer court, was 
gallery against gallery in three stories. 
4  And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a 
way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. 
 
5  Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher 
 
than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the 
building. 
6  For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the 
courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest 
 
and the middlemost from the ground. 
7  And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward 
the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof 
was fifty cubits.
