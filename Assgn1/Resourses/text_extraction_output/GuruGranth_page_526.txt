RAAG  DAYV-GANDHAAREE,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:   
Those who become the humble servants of the Lord and Master, lovingly focus their 
minds on Him. Those who chant Your Praises, through the Guru's Teachings, have great 
good  fortune  recorded  upon  their  foreheads.    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||      The  bonds  and 
shackles of Maya are shattered, by lovingly focusing their minds on the Name of the 
Lord. My mind is enticed by the Guru, the Enticer; beholding Him, I am wonder-struck.  
|| 1 ||   I slept through the entire dark night of my life, but through the tiniest bit of the 
Guru‟s Grace, I have been awakened. O Beautiful Lord God, Master of servant Nanak, 
there is none comparable to You.  || 2 || 1 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  Tell me — on 
what path will I find my Beauteous Lord? O Saints of the Lord, show me the Way, and I 
shall follow.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I cherish in my heart the Words of my Beloved; this is 
the best way. The bride may be hunch-backed and short, but if she is loved by her Lord 
Master, she becomes beautiful, and she melts in the Lord‟s embrace.  || 1 ||   There is 
only  the  One  Beloved  —  we  are  all  soul-brides  of  our  Husband  Lord.  She  who  is 
pleasing to her Husband Lord is good. What can poor, helpless Nanak do? As it pleases 
the Lord, so does he walk.  || 2 || 2 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  O my mind, chant the 
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. The Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of the 
poppy. His shawl is saturated with the Lord‟s Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I wander around 
here and there, like a madman, bewildered, seeking out my Darling Lord. I shall be the 
slave of the slave of whoever unites me with my Darling Beloved.  || 1 ||   So align 
yourself with the Almighty True Guru; drink in and savor the Ambrosial Nectar of the 
Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, servant Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Lord within.  || 2 
|| 3 ||   DAYV-GANDHAAREE:  Now, I have come, exhausted, to my Lord and Master. 
Now that I have come seeking Your Sanctuary, God, please, either save me, or kill me.
