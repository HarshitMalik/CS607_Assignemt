BHAGAVAD GITA
Maayayaapahritajnaanaa aasuram bhaavamaashritaah.
15. The evil-doers and the deluded, who are the lowest of men, do not seek Me; they whose
knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.
Chaturvidhaa bhajante maam janaah sukritino’rjuna;
Aarto jijnaasurartharthee jnaanee cha bharatarshabha.
16. Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna! They are the distressed, the seeker of
knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas!
Teshaam jnaanee nityayukta eka bhaktirvishishyate;
Priyo hi jnaanino’tyarthamaham sa cha mama priyah.
17. Of them, the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for, I am
exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.
Udaaraah sarva evaite jnaanee twaatmaiva me matam;
Aasthitah sa hi yuktaatmaa maamevaanuttamaam gatim.
18. Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in
mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.
Bahoonaam janmanaamante jnaanavaanmaam prapadyate;
Vaasudevah sarvamiti sa mahaatmaa sudurlabhah.
19. At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vasudeva
(the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.
Kaamaistaistairhritajnaanaah prapadyante’nyadevataah;
Tam tam niyamamaasthaaya prakrityaa niyataah swayaa.
20. Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods,
following this or that rite, led by their own nature.
Yo yo yaam yaam tanum bhaktah shraddhayaarchitum icchati;
Tasya tasyaachalaam shraddhaam taameva vidadhaamyaham.
21. Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faith—that (same) faith of his I
make firm and unflinching.
Sa tayaa shraddhayaa yuktastasyaaraadhanameehate;
Labhate cha tatah kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan hi taan.
22. Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form), and from it he obtains
his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).
