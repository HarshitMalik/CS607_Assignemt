  1807    Ezekiel 24 
8  that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set 
 
her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 
9  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the bloody city! I will 
   
even make the pile for fire great. 
10  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, 
and let the bones be burned. 
11  Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be 
hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, 
that the scum of it may be consumed. 
12  She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not 
forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire. 
 
13  In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou 
 
wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any 
more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. 
14  I the Lord have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I 
   
will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; 
 
according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge 
thee, saith the Lord God.

thy tears run down. 
17  Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of 
thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and 
cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. 
18  So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife 
 
died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. 
 
19  ¶ And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these 
things are to us, that thou doest so? 
 
20  Then I answered them, The word of the Lord came unto me, 
saying,
