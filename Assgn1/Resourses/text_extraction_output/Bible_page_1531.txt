  1532    Isaiah 24 
5  The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because 
 
they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the 
everlasting covenant. 
6  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell 
therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are 
 
burned, and few men left. 
7  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-
hearted do sigh. 
8  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, 
the joy of the harp ceaseth. 
9  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter 
 
to them that drink it. 
10  The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that 
 
no man may come in. 
11  There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the 
 
mirth of the land is gone. 
12  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with 
destruction. 
13  When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, 
there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning 
grapes when the vintage is done. 
14  ¶ They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the 
Lord, they shall cry aloud from the sea. 
15  Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires, even the name of the 
Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea. 
16  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even 
glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe 
unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the 
   
treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. 
17  ¶ Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of 
the earth. 
18  And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the 
fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of 
 
the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high 
 
are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
