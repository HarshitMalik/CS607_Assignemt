Ordinary  people’s  energy  rises  in  front  and  descends  in
back; realized people’s energy rises in back and descends
in  front.  When  energy  goes  out  and  in,  this  is  called
ordinary breathing; when it does not go out and in, this is
called true breathing.
Generally  speaking,  when  the  ordinary  breathing  is
stilled,  the  true  breathing  is  spontaneously  activated.  The
way  breathing  is  stilled  is  not  by  forcefully  holding  it  so
that  it  does  not  come  out.  It  is  a  matter  of  absolute
emptiness  and  utter  stillness;  the  steadier  the  mind,  the
subtler the breathing.
The  way  to  do  this  is  to  return  the  mind  to  quietude
whatever you are doing, not imagining what is yet to come
and  not  thinking  about  what  has  already  passed.  After  a
long  time  at  this,  spirit  and  energy  merge,  feelings  and
objects are forgotten; spirit solidifies, energy congeals, and
there  is  just  one  breath  in  the  belly,  revolving  without
going out or in. This is called womb breathing.
Once this breathing occurs, keep strictly to empty quiet,
refining vitality into energy, which goes through the three
passes and pours into the three chambers. This is called the
real  bellows,  the  real  furnace  and  cauldron,  and  the  real
firing process.
In Book of the Azure Vault it says, “In the past I met a
true  guide,  who  transmitted  the  spoken  secret;  it  just
requires  freezing  the  spirit  and  putting  it  in  the  lair  of
energy.”
