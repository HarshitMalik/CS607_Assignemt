  1647    Jeremiah 16 
9  For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will 
 
cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the 
voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the 
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.  
10  ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all 
these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the 
Lord pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our

16  ¶ Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they 
shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they 
 
shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out 
of the holes of the rocks. 
17  For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my 
 
face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes. 
18  And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
