  481    Deuteronomy 30 
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the 
Lord thy God hath driven thee, 
2  and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice 
according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy 
children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; 
 
3  that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have 
compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the 
nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. 
4  If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from 
thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he 
fetch thee: 
 
5  and the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy 
fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee 
 
good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. 
6  And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of 
thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with 
all thy soul, that thou mayest live. 
7  And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine 
enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. 
8  And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all 
his commandments which I command thee this day. 
9  And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of 
thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, 
and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the Lord will again 
 
rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 
 
10  if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep 
his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book 
of the law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine 
heart, and with all thy soul. 
11  Â¶ For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not 
hidden from thee, neither is it far off. 
12  It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us 
to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
