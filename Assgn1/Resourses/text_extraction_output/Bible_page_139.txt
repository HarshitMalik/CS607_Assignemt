  140    Exodus 8 
The Plague of Frogs 
25  ¶ And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten 
the river. 
8 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto 
him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve 
me. 
2  And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders 
with frogs: 
 
3  and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up 
and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy 
bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and 
into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
 
4  and the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and 
upon all thy servants. 
5  And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth 
thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over 
the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 
6  And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the 
 
frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
7  And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up 
frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
8  ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the 
Lord, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my 
people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto 
 
the Lord. 
9  And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat 
 
for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the 
frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river 
only?
