  1363    Psalms 119 
13  With my lips have I declared 
all the judgments of thy mouth. 
14  I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, 
as much as in all riches. 
15  I will meditate in thy precepts, 
and have respect unto thy ways. 
16  I will delight myself in thy statutes: 
 
I will not forget thy word. 
gimel 
17  Deal bountifully with thy servant, 
that I may live, and keep thy word. 
18  Open thou mine eyes, 
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 
19  I am a stranger in the earth: 
 
hide not thy commandments from me. 
20  My soul breaketh for the longing 
that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. 
21  Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, 
which do err from thy commandments. 
22  Remove from me reproach and contempt; 
 
for I have kept thy testimonies. 
23  Princes also did sit and speak against me: 
 
but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. 
24  Thy testimonies also are my delight, 
and my counselors. 
daleth 
25  My soul cleaveth unto the dust: 
 
quicken thou me according to thy word. 
26  I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: 
 
teach me thy statutes. 
27  Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: 
 
so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. 
28  My soul melteth for heaviness: 
 
strengthen thou me according unto thy word. 
29  Remove from me the way of lying:
