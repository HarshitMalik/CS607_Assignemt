  1214    Psalms 14 
How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
 
2  How long shall I take counsel in my soul, 
having sorrow in my heart daily? 
 
How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
 
3  Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: 
 
lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
 
4  lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; 
 
and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
5  But I have trusted in thy mercy; 
 
my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
6  I will sing unto the Lord, 
because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

The Folly and Wickedness of Men 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  The fool hath said in his heart, 
There is no God. 
They are corrupt, 
they have done abominable works, 
there is none that doeth good. 
2  The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, 
to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. 
3  They are all gone aside, 
they are all together become filthy: 
 
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  
4  Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? 
 
who eat up my people as they eat bread, 
and call not upon the Lord. 
5  There were they in great fear: 
 
for God is in the generation of the righteous.
