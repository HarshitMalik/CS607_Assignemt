  667    1 Samuel 20 
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and 
death. 
4  Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I 
will even do it for thee. 
5  And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new 
moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me 
 
go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. 
6  If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of 
me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly 
 
sacrifice there for all the family. 
7  If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be 
   
very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him. 
8  Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast 
 
brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: 
 
notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for 
 
why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? 
 
9  And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that 
 
evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would 
not I tell it thee? 
 
10  Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy 
 
father answer thee roughly? 
 
11  And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the 
field. And they went out both of them into the field. 
12  Â¶ And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I 
have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, 
and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto 
thee, and show it thee; 
 
13  the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my 
 
father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send thee away, 
that thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he 
 
hath been with my father. 
14  And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of 
the Lord, that I die not:
