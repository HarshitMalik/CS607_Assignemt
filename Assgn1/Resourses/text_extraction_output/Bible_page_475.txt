  476    Deuteronomy 28 
44  He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be 
 
the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 
45  Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue 
thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou 
 
hearkenedst not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his 
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee. 
46  And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon 
thy seed for ever. 
47  Â¶ Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and 
with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; 
 
48  therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies, which the Lord shall 
send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and 
in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, 
 
until he have destroyed thee. 
49  The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end 
of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou 
 
shalt not understand; 
 
50  a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of 
the old, nor show favor to the young: 
 
51  and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, 
until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, 
 
wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until 
he have destroyed thee. 
52  And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced 
walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: 
 
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, 
which the Lord thy God hath given thee. 
53  And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons 
and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in 
the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall 
distress thee: 
 
54  so that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye 
shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, 
and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
