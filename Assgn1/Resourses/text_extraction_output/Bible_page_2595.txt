  2596    2 Peter 2 
12  But these, as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed, 
speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly 
 
perish in their own corruption; 
 
13  and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count 
it pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, 
sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast 
with you; 
 
14  having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; 
 
beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous 
 
practices; cursed children: 
   
15  which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following 
the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of 
unrighteousness; 
 
16  but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s 
 
voice forbade the madness of the prophet.  
17  ¶ These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a 
tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 
 
18  For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure 
through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that 
were clean escaped from them who live in error. 
19  While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants 
of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he 
 
brought in bondage. 
20  For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through 
the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again 
entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them 
than the beginning. 
21  For it had been better for them not to have known the way of 
righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy 
commandment delivered unto them. 
22  But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The 
dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed 
 
to her wallowing in the mire.
