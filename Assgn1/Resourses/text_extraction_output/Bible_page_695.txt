  696    2 Samuel 2 
from the fat of the mighty, 
the bow of Jonathan turned not back, 
and the sword of Saul returned not empty. 
23  Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, 
and in their death they were not divided: 
 
they were swifter than eagles, 
they were stronger than lions. 
24  Ye daughters of Israel, 
weep over Saul, 
who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights; 
 
who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 
25  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! 
 
O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. 
26  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: 
 
very pleasant hast thou been unto me: 
 
thy love to me was wonderful, 
passing the love of women. 
27  How are the mighty fallen, 
and the weapons of war perished!

David Made King over Judah 
1  And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the Lord, 
saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord 
 
said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And 
 
he said, Unto Hebron. 
2  So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the 
Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabalâ€™s wife the Carmelite.  
3  And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man 
with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 
 
4  And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king 
over the house of Judah.
