  1757    Ezekiel 3 
7  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not 
 
hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-
 
hearted. 
8  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy 
forehead strong against their foreheads. 
9  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear 
 
them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a 
rebellious house. 
10  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall 
speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
11  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy 
people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord 
God; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. 
 
12  ¶ Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a 
great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his 
place. 
13  I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that 
touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against 
them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
14  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in 
bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was 
 
strong upon me. 
15  Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the 
river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there 
astonished among them seven days. 
A Watchman to Israel 
16  ¶ And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the 
Lord came unto me, saying, 
17  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: 
 
therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from 
me. 
18  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest 
 
him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked
