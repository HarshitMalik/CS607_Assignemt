  1880    Daniel 4 
5  I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my 
bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
6  Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon 
before me, that they might make known unto me the 
interpretation of the dream. 
7  Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and 
the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not 
   
make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 
8  But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was 
Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the 
spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 
 
9  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the 
spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell 
me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation 
thereof. 
10  Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a 
 
tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. 
11  The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto 
heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 
 
12  the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it 
was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the 
 
fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was 
fed of it. 
13  ¶ I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a 
watcher and a holy one came down from heaven; 
 
14  he cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his 
branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get 
 
away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: 
 
15  nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a 
band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be 
 
wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in 
the grass of the earth: 
 
16  let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given 
unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
