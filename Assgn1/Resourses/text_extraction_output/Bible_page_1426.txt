  1427    Proverbs 14 
14  The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: 
 
and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. 
15  The simple believeth every word: 
 
but the prudent man looketh well to his going. 
16  A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: 
 
but the fool rageth, and is confident. 
17  He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: 
 
and a man of wicked devices is hated. 
18  The simple inherit folly: 
 
but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 
19  The evil bow before the good; 
 
and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 
20  The poor is hated even of his own neighbor: 
 
but the rich hath many friends. 
21  He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth: 
 
but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. 
22  Do they not err that devise evil? 
 
But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. 
23  In all labor there is profit: 
 
but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 
24  The crown of the wise is their riches: 
 
but the foolishness of fools is folly. 
25  A true witness delivereth souls: 
 
but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. 
26  In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: 
 
and his children shall have a place of refuge. 
27  The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, 
to depart from the snares of death. 
28  In the multitude of people is the kingâ€™s honor: 
 
but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. 
29  He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: 
 
but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 
30  A sound heart is the life of the flesh: 
 
but envy the rottenness of the bones. 
31  He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:
