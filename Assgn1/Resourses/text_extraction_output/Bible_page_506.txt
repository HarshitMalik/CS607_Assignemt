  507    Joshua 7 
27  ¶ So the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was noised 
 
throughout all the country. 
7 
The Sin of Achan 
1  But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed 
thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of 
 
Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the 
 
anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. 
2  ¶ And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-
aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go 
up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 
3  And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the 
people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and 
 
smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are 
   
but few. 
4  So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; 
 
and they fled before the men of Ai. 
5  And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for 
 
they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and 
smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people 
 
melted, and became as water. 
6  ¶ And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face 
before the ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of 
Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 
7  And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all 
brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the 
Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and 
 
dwelt on the other side Jordan! 
 
8  O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before 
their enemies!
