  1508    Isaiah 9 
3  Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they 
 
joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice 
when they divide the spoil. 
4  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his 
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. 
5  For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments 
rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. 
 
6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the 
 
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be 
 
called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting 
Father, The Prince of Peace. 
7  Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, 
upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and 
to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even 
for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. 
The Lord’s Anger against Israel 
8  ¶ The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
9  And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of 
Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, 
10  The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the 
 
sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. 
11  Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against 
him, and join his enemies together; 
 
12  the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall 
 
devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned 
away, but his hand is stretched out still. 
13  ¶ For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither 
do they seek the Lord of hosts. 
14  Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch 
and rush, in one day. 
15  The ancient and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that 
 
teacheth lies, he is the tail.
