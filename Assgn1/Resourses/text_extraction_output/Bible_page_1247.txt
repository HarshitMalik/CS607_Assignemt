  1248    Psalms 38 
for the end of that man is peace. 
38  But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: 
 
the end of the wicked shall be cut off. 
39  But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: 
 
he is their strength in the time of trouble. 
40  And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: 
 
he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, 
because they trust in him.

The Prayer of a Suffering Penitent 
A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. 
1  O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: 
 
neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
2  For thine arrows stick fast in me, 
and thy hand presseth me sore. 
3  There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; 
 
neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 
4  For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: 
 
as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
5  My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 
6  I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; 
   
I go mourning all the day long. 
7  For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: 
 
and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
8  I am feeble and sore broken: 
 
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
9  Lord, all my desire is before thee; 
 
and my groaning is not hid from thee. 
10  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: 
 
as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 
11  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore;
