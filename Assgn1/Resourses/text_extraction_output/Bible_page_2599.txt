  2600    1 John 2 
10  If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word 
is not in us. 
2 
1  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. 
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus 
Christ the righteous: 
 
2  and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but 
 
also for the sins of the whole world.

3  ¶ And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his 
commandments. 
4  He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is 
a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
5  But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God 
perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 
 
6  He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even 
as he walked. 
7  ¶ Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old 
commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old 
commandment is the word which ye have heard from the 
beginning. 
8  Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true 
in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light 
 
now shineth. 
9  He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in 
darkness even until now. 
10  He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none 
occasion of stumbling in him. 
11  But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in 
darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that 
darkness hath blinded his eyes.
