  967    1 Chronicles 28 
28 
Solomon Succeeds David as King 
1  And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the 
tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the 
king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains 
over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and 
possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with 
the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem. 
2  Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my 
brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build a 
 
house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the 
footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 
 
3  but God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, 
because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
4  Howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of 
my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah 
 
to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; 
   
and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over 
all Israel: 
 
5  and of all my sons, (for the Lord hath given me many sons,) he 
hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the 
kingdom of the Lord over Israel. 
6  And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house 
and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his 
 
father. 
7  Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to 
do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.  
8  Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the 
Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the 
commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may possess this 
 
good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after 
you for ever.
