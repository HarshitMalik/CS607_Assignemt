  2387    Acts 28 
5  And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
6  Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down 
dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no 
 
harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was 
a god. 
7  ¶ In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the 
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us 
 
three days courteously. 
8  And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and 
of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his 
 
hands on him, and healed him. 
9  So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the 
island, came, and were healed: 
 
10  who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, 
 
they laded us with such things as were necessary. 
Paul Arrives at Rome 
11  ¶ And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, 
which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
12  And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. 
13  And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and 
 
after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to 
Puteoli: 
 
14  where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them 
seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
 
15  And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to 
meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns; whom when 
 
Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
16  And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners 
to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by 
 
himself with a soldier that kept him.
