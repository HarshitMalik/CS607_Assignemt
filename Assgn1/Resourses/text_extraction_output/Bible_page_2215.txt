  2216    Luke 18 
4  And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within 
 
himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
 
5  yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her 
continual coming she weary me. 
6  And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
7  And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night 
unto him, though he bear long with them? 
 
8  I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the 
Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? 
 
The Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican 
9  ¶ And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in 
themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
 
10  Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and 
 
the other a publican. 
11  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank 
thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, 
adulterers, or even as this publican. 
12  I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
13  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his 
eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be 
merciful to me a sinner. 
14  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the 
other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he 
   
that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  
Jesus Blesses Little Children 
15  ¶ And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch 
them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
 
16  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to 
come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of 
 
God.
