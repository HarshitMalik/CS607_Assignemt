  2394    Romans 2 
The Jews and the Law 
17  ¶ Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest 
thy boast of God, 
18  and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more 
excellent, being instructed out of the law; 
 
19  and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light 
of them which are in darkness, 
20  an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form 
of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
21  Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? 
 
thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 
 
22  thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou 
commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit 
 
sacrilege? 
 
23  thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law 
dishonorest thou God? 
 
24  For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through 
you, as it is written. 
25  ¶ For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou 
 
be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 
26  Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, 
shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 
 
27  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, 
judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the 
law? 
 
28  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that 
 
circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 
 
29  but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of 
 
the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of 
 
men, but of God.
