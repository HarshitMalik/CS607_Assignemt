  422    Deuteronomy 5 
18  ¶ Neither shalt thou commit adultery.  
19  ¶ Neither shalt thou steal.  
20  ¶ Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.  
21  ¶ Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor’s wife, neither shalt thou 
covet thy neighbor’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his 
maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor’s. 
The People’s Fear 
22  ¶ These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount 
out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, 
with a great voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them in 
 
two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 
23  And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the 
darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near 
unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
 
24  and ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us his glory 
and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of 
the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he 
 
liveth. 
25  Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume 
 
us: if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we 
 
shall die. 
26  For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living 
God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
 
27  Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and 
 
speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto 
thee; and we will hear it, and do it.  
 
28  ¶ And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto 
me; and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the 
 
words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have 
 
well said all that they have spoken. 
29  Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, 
and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with 
them, and with their children for ever!
