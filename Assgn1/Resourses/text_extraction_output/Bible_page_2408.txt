and her beloved, 
which was not beloved.  
26  And it shall come to pass, 
that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; 
 
there shall they be called the children of the living God.  
27  Isaiah also crieth concerning Israel, 
Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the 
sea, 
a remnant shall be saved: 
 
28  for he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: 
 
because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  
29  And as Isaiah said before, 
Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, 
we had been as Sodom, 
and been made like unto Gomorrah.  
Righteousness Based on Faith 
30  ¶ What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not 
 
after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the 
righteousness which is of faith. 
31  But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not 
attained to the law of righteousness. 
32  Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the 
 
works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
 
33  as it is written, 
Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone 
and rock of offense: 
 
and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

1  Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they 
might be saved.
