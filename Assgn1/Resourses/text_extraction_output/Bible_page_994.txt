  995    2 Chronicles 11 
The Prosperity of Rehoboam 
5  ¶ And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in 
Judah. 
6  He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 
7  and Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam, 
8  and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 
9  and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 
10  and Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in 
Benjamin, fenced cities. 
11  And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and 
store of victuals, and of oil and wine. 
12  And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them 
exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side. 
13  ¶ And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to 
him out of all their coasts. 
14  For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to 
Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off 
 
from executing the priest’s office unto the Lord: 
 
15  and he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, 
and for the calves which he had made. 
16  And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts 
to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto 
the Lord God of their fathers. 
17  So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam 
the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked 
 
in the way of David and Solomon. 
18  ¶ And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the 
son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of 
Jesse; 
 
19  which bare him children; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. 
 
20  And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which 
 
bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 
21  And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all 
his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
