  705    2 Samuel 5 
Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come 
in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. 
 
7  Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion: the same is the 
 
city of David. 
8  And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, 
and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated 
of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, 
The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. 
9  So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And 
David built round about from Millo and inward. 
10  And David went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts 
was with him. 
Hiram’s Recognition of David 
11  ¶ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar 
trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house. 
 
12  And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over 
Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s 
sake. 
David’s Children Born at Jerusalem 
13  ¶ And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, 
after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and 
 
daughters born to David. 
14  And these be the names of those that were born unto him in 
Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 
 
15  Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
16  and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
