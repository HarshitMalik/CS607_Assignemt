  435    Deuteronomy 11 
11 
The Greatness of the Lord 
1  Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge, 
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. 
2  And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which 
 
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the 
Lord your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched 
out arm, 
3  and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt 
unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;  
 
4  and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to 
their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow 
 
them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord hath destroyed 
them unto this day; 
 
5  and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this 
place; 
 
6  and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the 
son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed 
 
them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the 
substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:  
 
7  but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did. 
The Blessings of the Promised Land 
8  Â¶ Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command 
you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, 
whither ye go to possess it; 
 
9  and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord 
sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land 
that floweth with milk and honey. 
10  For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of 
Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and 
wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
