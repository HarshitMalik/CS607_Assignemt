  2135    Mark 12 
and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:  
 
this is the first commandment. 
31  And the second is like, namely this, 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  
There is none other commandment greater than these. 
32  And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the 
truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  
     
33  and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, 
and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his 
neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and 
sacrifices.  
34  And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, 
Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that 
durst ask him any question.  
The Question about David’s Son 
35  ¶ And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How 
say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 
 
36  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, 
The Lord said to my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, 
till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
37  David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his 
 
son? And the common people heard him gladly. 
 
Jesus Denounces the Scribes 
38  ¶ And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, 
which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the market 
places, 
39  and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at 
feasts: 
 
40  which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long 
prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
