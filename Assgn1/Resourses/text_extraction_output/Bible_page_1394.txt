  1395    Psalms 145 
9  I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: 
 
upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings 
will I sing praises unto thee. 
10  It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: 
 
who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 
11  Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, 
whose mouth speaketh vanity, 
and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood: 
 
12  that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; 
 
that our daughters may be as corner stones, 
polished after the similitude of a palace: 
 
13  that our garners may be full, 
affording all manner of store; 
 
that our sheep may bring forth thousands 
and ten thousands in our streets: 
 
14  that our oxen may be strong to labor; 
 
that there be no breaking in, nor going out; 
 
that there be no complaining in our streets. 
15  Happy is that people, that is in such a case: 
 
yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord.

Praise for the Lord’s Goodness and Power 
David’s Psalm of praise. 
1  I will extol thee, my God, O King; 
 
and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
2  Every day will I bless thee; 
 
and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
3  Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; 
 
and his greatness is unsearchable. 
4  One generation shall praise thy works to another, 
and shall declare thy mighty acts.
