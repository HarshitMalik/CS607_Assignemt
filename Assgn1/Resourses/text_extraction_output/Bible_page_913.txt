  914    1 Chronicles 5 
4  The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, 
 
5  Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son, 
6  Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away 
captive: he was prince of the Reubenites. 
 
7  And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their 
generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, 
8  and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who 
dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-meon: 
 
9  and eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness 
from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in 
 
the land of Gilead. 
10  And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell 
by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east 
 
land of Gilead. 
The Descendants of Gad 
11  Â¶ And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of 
Bashan unto Salcah: 
 
12  Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in 
Bashan. 
13  And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and 
Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, 
seven. 
14  These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, 
the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son 
of Jahdo, the son of Buz; 
 
15  Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their 
fathers. 
16  And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all 
the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders. 
17  All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king 
of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
