  1125    Esther 8 
8  Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and 
seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the 
 
king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse. 
9  ¶ Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third 
month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day 
thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai 
 
commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies 
and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a 
hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province 
according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their 
language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according 
to their language. 
10  And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the 
king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on 
mules, camels, and young dromedaries: 
 
11  wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to 
gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to 
slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and

to take the spoil of them for a prey,

the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
13  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every 
province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be 
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
14  So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being 
hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the 
decree was given at Shushan the palace. 
15  ¶ And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal 
apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with 
a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced 
 
and was glad. 
16  The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor. 
17  And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s 
commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,
