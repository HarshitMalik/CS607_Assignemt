  2185    Luke 9 
Jesus Foretells His Death 
21  ¶ And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no

not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

30  And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses 
and Elijah: 
 
31  who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should 
accomplish at Jerusalem. 
32  But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and 
 
when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that 
stood with him. 
33  And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto 
Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three
