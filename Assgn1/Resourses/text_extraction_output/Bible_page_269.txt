9  and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be cut 
 
off from among his people. 
The Eating of Blood Forbidden 
10  ¶ And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the 
strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of 
blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, 
 
and will cut him off from among his people.  
11  For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you 
 
upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the 
 
blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.  
12  Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat 
blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat 
blood. 
13  And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the 
strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any 
beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood 
 
thereof, and cover it with dust. 
14  ¶ For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: 
   
therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of 
no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: 
   
whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 
15  And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which 
was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a 
stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. 
 
16  But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his 
 
iniquity.
