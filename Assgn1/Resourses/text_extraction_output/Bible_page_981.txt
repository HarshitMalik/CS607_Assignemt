  982    2 Chronicles 6 
6 
The Dedication of the Temple 
1  Then said Solomon, The Lord hath said that he would dwell in 
the thick darkness. 
2  But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy 
dwelling for ever. 
3  And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation 
of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 
 
4  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath with his 
hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father

name of the Lord God of Israel. 
8  But the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine 
heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in 
thine heart: 
 
9  notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which 
 
shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my 
name.

for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the 
throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house 
for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
11  And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, 
that he made with the children of Israel. 
12  Â¶ And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all 
the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
