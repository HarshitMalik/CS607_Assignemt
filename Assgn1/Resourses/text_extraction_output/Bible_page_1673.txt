  1674    Jeremiah 29 
15  Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear 
now, Hananiah; The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest 
   
this people to trust in a lie. 
16  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will cast thee from off the 
 
face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught 
 
rebellion against the Lord. 
17  ¶ So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh 
month.

Jeremiah’s Letter to the Captives 
1  Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet 
sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were 
carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to 
all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive 
from Jerusalem to Babylon; 
 
2  (after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the 
princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, 
were departed from Jerusalem;)  
 
3  by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of 
Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, 
4  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are 
carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from 
Jerusalem unto Babylon; 
 
5  Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the 
 
fruit of them; 
 
6  take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for 
 
your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear 
sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not 
 
diminished.
