85  each charger of silver weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, each 
bowl seventy: all the silver vessels weighed two thousand and four 
 
hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
 
86  the golden spoons were twelve, full of incense, weighing ten shekels 
apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary: all the gold of the spoons 
 
was a hundred and twenty shekels. 
87  All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams 
twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: 
 
and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve. 
88  And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty 
and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of 
the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it 
was anointed. 
89  Â¶ And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the 
congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one 
speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of 
testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spake unto 
 
him.

Aaron Lights the Lamps 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the 
lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. 
3  And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the 
 
candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
4  And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold; unto the shaft 
 
thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto 
 
the pattern which the Lord had showed Moses, so he made the 
candlestick.
