  1632    Jeremiah 9 
Ruin and Exile Threatened 
12  ¶ Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to 
 
whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, that he may declare it, 
for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that 
none passeth through? 
 
13  And the Lord saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I 
set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked 
therein; 
 
14  but have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after 
Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 
 
15  therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I 
 
will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them 
water of gall to drink. 
16  I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor 
their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I 
 
have consumed them. 
17  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the 
mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning 
 
women, that they may come: 
 
18  and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes 
may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
19  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we 
 
are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because 
our dwellings have cast us out. 
20  ¶ Yet hear the word of the Lord, O ye women, and let your ear 
receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, 
and every one her neighbor lamentation. 
21  For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our 
palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men 
from the streets. 
22  Speak, Thus saith the Lord, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as 
dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, 
and none shall gather them.
