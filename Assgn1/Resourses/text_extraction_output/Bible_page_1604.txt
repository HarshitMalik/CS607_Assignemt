  1605    Isaiah 65 
5  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those 
that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we 
   
have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. 
 
6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as 
filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the 
   
wind, have taken us away. 
7  And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up 
himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and 
 
hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 
8  ¶ But now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou 
 
our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. 
 
9  Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for 
ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. 
 
10  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a 
desolation. 
11  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is 
burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
 
12  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Lord? wilt thou hold 
 
thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

Punishment of the Rebellious 
1  I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that 
 
sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that 
 
was not called by my name. 
2  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, 
which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own 
thoughts; 
 
3  a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that 
 
sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 
 
4  which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments; 
 
which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their 
vessels;
