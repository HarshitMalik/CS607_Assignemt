  1885    Daniel 5 
17  ¶ Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to 
thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing 
 
unto the king and make known to him the interpretation. 
18  O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a 
kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor: 
 
19  and for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and 
languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he 
 
slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set 
   
up; and whom he would he put down. 
 
20  But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, 
he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory 
from him: 
 
21  and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made 
 
like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed 
 
him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of 
heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom 
 
of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. 
22  And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, 
though thou knewest all this; 
 
23  but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have 
 
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, 
thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou 
 
hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and 
stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose 
 
hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not 
glorified. 
24  ¶ Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing 
 
was written. 
25  And this is the writing that was written, Mene, mene, tekel, 
upharsin. 
26  This is the interpretation of the thing: Mene; God hath numbered 
   
thy kingdom, and finished it. 
27  Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
 
28  Peres; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and 
 
Persians.
