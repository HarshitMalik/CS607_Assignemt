  2030    Matthew 8 
21  And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to 
go and bury my father. 
22  But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their 
 
dead. 
Jesus Calms a Storm 
23  ¶ And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. 
24  And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that 
the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. 
 
25  And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save 
us: we perish. 
 
26  And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? 
 
Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a 
 
great calm. 
27  But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that 
even the winds and the sea obey him! 
 
The Gergesene Demoniacs 
28  ¶ And when he was come to the other side into the country of the 
Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out 
of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that 
way. 
29  And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, 
Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before 
 
the time? 
 
30  And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine 
feeding. 
31  So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to 
go away into the herd of swine. 
32  And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they 
went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine 
 
ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the 
waters.
