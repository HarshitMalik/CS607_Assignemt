  1271    Psalms 55 
deceit and guile depart not from her streets. 
12  For it was not an enemy that reproached me; 
 
then I could have borne it: 
 
neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; 
 
then I would have hid myself from him: 
 
13  but it was thou, a man mine equal, 
my guide, and mine acquaintance. 
14  We took sweet counsel together, 
and walked unto the house of God in company. 
15  Let death seize upon them, 
and let them go down quick into hell: 
 
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 
16  As for me, I will call upon God; 
 
and the Lord shall save me. 
17  Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: 
 
and he shall hear my voice. 
18  He hath delivered my soul in peace 
from the battle that was against me: 
 
for there were many with me. 
19  God shall hear, and afflict them, 
even he that abideth of old. 
Selah. 
Because they have no changes, 
therefore they fear not God. 
20  He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: 
 
he hath broken his covenant. 
21  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, 
but war was in his heart: 
 
his words were softer than oil, 
yet were they drawn swords. 
22  Cast thy burden upon the Lord, 
and he shall sustain thee: 
 
he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
23  But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of 
destruction:
