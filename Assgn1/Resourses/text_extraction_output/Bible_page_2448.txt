  2449    1 Corinthians 14 
23  If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and 
all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, 
or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 
 
24  But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one 
unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 
 
25  and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling 
 
down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you 
of a truth. 
26  ¶ How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of 
 
you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, 
hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
27  If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the 
most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. 
 
28  But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; 
 
and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
29  Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. 
30  If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold 
his peace. 
31  For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may 
be comforted. 
32  And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
33  For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all 
churches of the saints. 
34  ¶ Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not 
 
permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under 
 
obedience, as also saith the law. 
35  And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at 
home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
 
36  What! came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you 
   
only? 
 
37  ¶ If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him 
acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the 
commandments of the Lord. 
38  But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
