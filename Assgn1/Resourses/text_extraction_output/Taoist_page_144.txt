This  is  called  assembling  the  five  forces  of  yin  and
yang; in a quarter hour’s exercise you take over the energy
process of a whole year. At this point you are truly empty
and  truly  calm.  Go  on  for  one  or  two  years,  up  to  ten
years, or a hundred years, and you break through space to
merge  with  the  cosmic  void.  This  exercise  is  for  refining
the spirit back into emptiness.
Once  the  ten  months  of  the  preliminary  work  are
completed,  then  you  must  watch  over  the  “infant”  at  all
times.  Ten  steps,  a  hundred  steps,  a  thousand  miles,  ten
thousand miles—it goes out gradually. If you just let it go
with no restraint, it will get lost and not return.
A  classic  of  immortalism  says,  “When  spirit  enters
energy, it forms an embryo; when energy cleaves to spirit,
it crystallizes the alchemical pill.” This is what is called “a
point dropping into the yellow court.”
People who have few miscellaneous thoughts obtain the
elixir  pill  rapidly,  while  those  who  have  a  lot  of
miscellaneous  thoughts  are  slow  to  obtain  the  pill.  This
method  is  simple  and  easy,  but  people  just  will  not  put
forth  the  effort.  If  you  can  practice  it  consistently  for  a
long  time,  you  will  surely  “penetrate  metal  and  stone,”
“walk  on  water  and  fire,”  and  “comprehend  heaven  and
earth.”
