  120    Genesis 49 
for in their anger they slew a man, 
and in their self-will they digged down a wall. 
7  Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; 
 
and their wrath, for it was cruel: 
 
I will divide them in Jacob, 
and scatter them in Israel. 
8  Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: 
 
thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; 
 
thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. 
9  Judah is a lion’s whelp: 
 
from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: 
 
he stooped down, he couched as a lion, 
and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?  
   
10  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, 
nor a lawgiver from between his feet, 
until Shiloh come; 
 
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 
11  Binding his foal unto the vine, 
and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; 
 
he washed his garments in wine, 
and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 
 
12  his eyes shall be red with wine, 
and his teeth white with milk. 
13  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; 
 
and he shall be for a haven of ships; 
 
and his border shall be unto Zidon. 
14  Issachar is a strong ass 
couching down between two burdens: 
 
15  and he saw that rest was good, 
and the land that it was pleasant; 
 
and bowed his shoulder to bear, 
and became a servant unto tribute. 
16  Dan shall judge his people, 
as one of the tribes of Israel. 
17  Dan shall be a serpent by the way,
