  1338    Psalms 104 
so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 
12  As far as the east is from the west, 
so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
13  Like as a father pitieth his children, 
so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. 
14  For he knoweth our frame; 
 
he remembereth that we are dust. 
15  As for man, his days are as grass: 
 
as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
16  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; 
 
and the place thereof shall know it no more. 
17  But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting 
upon them that fear him, 
and his righteousness unto children’s children; 
 
18  to such as keep his covenant, 
and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 
19  The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; 
 
and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
20  Bless the Lord, ye his angels, 
that excel in strength, 
that do his commandments, 
hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
21  Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; 
 
ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
22  Bless the Lord, all his works 
in all places of his dominion: 
 
bless the Lord, O my soul.

The Lord’s Care for His Creation 
1  Bless the Lord, O my soul. 
O Lord my God, thou art very great; 
 
thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
