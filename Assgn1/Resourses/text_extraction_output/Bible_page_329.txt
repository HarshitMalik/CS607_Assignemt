  330    Numbers 9 
13  But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to

appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 
14  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the 
passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the 
 
passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye 
 
shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that 
was born in the land.

tents. 
19  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, 
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord, and 
journeyed not. 
20  And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; 
 
according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their 
tents, and according to the commandment of the Lord they 
journeyed. 
21  And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, 
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they
