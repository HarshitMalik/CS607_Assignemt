  1333    Psalms 99 
for he cometh to judge the earth: 
 
with righteousness shall he judge the world, 
and the people with equity. 
99 
The Lord’s Faithfulness to Israel 
1  The Lord reigneth; 
 
let the people tremble: 
 
he sitteth between the cherubim;  
 
let the earth be moved. 
2  The Lord is great in Zion; 
 
and he is high above all the people. 
3  Let them praise thy great and terrible name; 
 
for it is holy. 
4  The king’s strength also loveth judgment; 
 
thou dost establish equity, 
thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
5  Exalt ye the Lord our God, 
and worship at his footstool; 
 
for he is holy. 
6  Moses and Aaron among his priests, 
and Samuel among them that call upon his name; 
 
they called upon the Lord, 
and he answered them. 
7  He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar:  
 
they kept his testimonies, 
and the ordinance that he gave them. 
8  Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God: 
 
thou wast a God that forgavest them, 
though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 
9  Exalt the Lord our God, 
and worship at his holy hill; 
 
for the Lord our God is holy.
