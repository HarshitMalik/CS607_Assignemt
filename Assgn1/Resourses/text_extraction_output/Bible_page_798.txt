  799    1 Kings 12 
Jeroboam Leads Israel into Sin 
25  Â¶ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt 
therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
 
26  And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to 
the house of David: 
 
27  if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at 
Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their 
lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, 
and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
28  Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, 
and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: 
 
behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of 
Egypt.  
29  And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. 
30  And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before 
 
the one, even unto Dan. 
31  And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest 
of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
32  And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the 
fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and 
he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the 
calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the 
 
high places which he had made. 
33  So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the 
fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had 
devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of 
 
Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
