  2213    Luke 17 
2  It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, 
and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these 
little ones. 
3  Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke 
 
him; and if he repent, forgive him.  
 
4  And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times 
in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

5  ¶ And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
6  And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye 
might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, 
and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. 
 
The Servant’s Duty 
7  ¶ But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will

sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; 
 
and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
 
9  Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were 
commanded him? I trow not. 
 
10  So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are 
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done 
 
that which was our duty to do. 
Jesus Cleanses Ten Lepers 
11  ¶ And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed 
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
12  And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men 
that were lepers, which stood afar off:
