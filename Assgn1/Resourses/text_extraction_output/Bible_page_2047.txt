  2048    Matthew 13 
The Pearl of Great Price 
45  ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, 
seeking goodly pearls: 
 
46  who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all 
that he had, and bought it. 
The Net 
47  ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into 
the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
 
48  which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and 
gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. 
49  So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, 
 
and sever the wicked from among the just, 
50  and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing 
 
and gnashing of teeth. 
Treasures New and Old 
51  ¶ Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They 
 
say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
52  Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed 
unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is a 
householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new 
and old. 
Jesus Rejected at Nazareth 
53  ¶ And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, 
he departed thence. 
54  And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in 
their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, 
Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
