  307    Numbers 3

The Number and Duties of the Levites 
1  These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses, in the day that 
the Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 
2  And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, 
 
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
3  These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were 
anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. 
4  And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offered 
strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they 
had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s 
 
office in the sight of Aaron their father. 
5  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
6  Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the 
priest, that they may minister unto him. 
7  And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole 
congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the 
service of the tabernacle. 
8  And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the 
service of the tabernacle. 
9  And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are 
 
wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 
10  And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on 
their priest’s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put 
 
to death. 
11  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
12  And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of 
Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among 
the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;  
   
13  because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the 
 
firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn 
in Israel, both man and beast: mine they shall be: I am the Lord.
