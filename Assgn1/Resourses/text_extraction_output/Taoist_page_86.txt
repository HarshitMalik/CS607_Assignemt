When  they  learn  this  much  of  the  Way,  many  people
crave worldly fame, profit, and honor. All this belongs to
contaminated spirit and energy; since it cannot be assured,
many  take  to  voluntary  disembodiment.  This  should  be
immediately  abandoned,  because  contaminated
phenomena are unreal. The Tao Te Ching says, “Ordinary
people  try  to  shine;  I  alone  am  obscure.  Ordinary  people
try to be smart; I alone am ignorant.”
SINCERITY
The whole Classic  on  the  Mean  is  all  about  sincerity.  To
choose  what  is  good  and  hold  to  it  firmly  is  a  matter  of
sincerity. Involvement in assistance and providing suitable
education  are  works  of  supreme  sincerity.  Supreme
sincerity  is  called  sagehood;  this  is  the  celestial  path.
Maintaining sincerity is called wisdom; this is the human
path. Only when we emulate the celestial can we attain the
human; when we fulfill the human, we can accord with the
celestial. Therefore it is said that they are one at the stage
of attainment.
The  Way  of  heaven  and  earth  can  give  life  to  myriad
beings only because of sincerity. The way of emperors and
kings can govern people only through sincerity; the way of
sages can provide myriad virtues only by sincerity.
Being careful when alone and being thoroughgoing are
the  most  essential  exercises  for  seeking  sincerity  in  the
midst of daily affairs.
