  592    Judges 15 
18  And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before 
the sun went down, 
What is sweeter than honey? 
 
And what is stronger than a lion? 
 
And he said unto them, 
If ye had not plowed with my heifer, 
ye had not found out my riddle. 
19  And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to 
Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and 
gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. 
And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house. 
20  But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used 
as his friend. 
15 
1  But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat 
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will 
 
go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer 
him to go in. 
2  And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated 
her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger 
   
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. 
 
3  And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless 
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 
4  And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took 
firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst 
between two tails. 
5  And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the 
standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and 
also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. 
6  Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, 
 
Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his 
wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, 
and burnt her and her father with fire.
