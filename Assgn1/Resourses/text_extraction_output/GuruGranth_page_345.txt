My cargo is loaded, and now I am leaving.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   I am the merchant of the 
Lord; I deal in spiritual wisdom. I have loaded the Wealth of the Lord‟s Name; the world 
has  loaded  poison.  || 2 ||   O you who know this world and the world beyond: write 
whatever nonsense you please about me. The club of the Messenger of Death shall not 
strike me, since I have cast off all entanglements.  || 3 ||   Love of this world is like the 
pale,  temporary  color  of  the  safflower.  The  color  of  my  Lord‟s  Love,  however,  is 
permanent, like the dye of the madder plant. So says Ravi Daas, the tanner.  || 4 || 1 ||    
GAUREE POORBEE,  RAVI DAAS JEE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The frog in the deep well knows nothing of its own country or other lands; just so, my 
mind, infatuated with corruption, understands nothing about this world or the next.  || 1 ||   
O Lord of all worlds: reveal to me, even for an instant, the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  
|| 1 ||  Pause  ||   My intellect is polluted; I cannot understand Your state, O Lord. Take 
pity on me, dispel my doubts, and teach me true wisdom.  || 2 ||   Even the great Yogis 
cannot  describe  Your  Glorious  Virtues;  they  are  beyond  words.  I  am  dedicated  to  Your 
loving devotional worship, says Ravi Daas the tanner.  || 3 || 1 ||    
GAUREE BAIRAAGAN:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, was Truth; in the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, charitable 
feasts; in the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga, there was worship. In those three ages, people 
held to these three ways. But in the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the Lord is your 
only Support.  || 1 ||   How can I swim across? No one has explained to me, so that I 
might understand how I can escape reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   So many forms of 
religion have been described; the whole world is practicing them. What actions will bring 
emancipation, and total perfection?  || 2 ||   One may distinguish between good and evil 
actions,  and  listen  to  the  Vedas  and  the  Puraanas,  but  doubt  still  persists.  Skepticism 
continually dwells in the heart, so who can eradicate egotistical pride?  || 3 ||   Outwardly, 
he washes with water, but deep within, his heart is tarnished by all sorts of vices. So how 
can  he  become  pure?  His  method  of  purification  is  like  that  of  an  elephant,  covering 
himself with dust right after his bath!  || 4 ||   With the rising of the sun, the night is 
brought to its end; the whole world knows this. It is believed that with the touch of the 
Philosopher‟s  Stone,  copper  is  immediately  transformed  into  gold.    ||  5  ||      When  one 
meets the Supreme Philosopher‟s Stone, the Guru, if such pre-ordained destiny is written 
on one‟s forehead, then the soul blends with the Supreme Soul, and the stubborn doors 
are opened wide.  || 6 ||   Through the way of devotion, the intellect is imbued with Truth; 
doubts, entanglements and vices are cut away. The mind is restrained, and one attains joy, 
contemplating the One Lord, who is both with and without qualities.  || 7 ||   I have tried 
many methods, but by turning it away, the noose of doubt is not turned away. Love and 
devotion have not welled up within me, and so Ravi Daas is disillusioned and discouraged.
