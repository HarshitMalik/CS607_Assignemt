  438    Deuteronomy 12 
2  Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye 
shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon 
the hills, and under every green tree: 
 
3  and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and 
burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven 
 
images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that 
place.  
4  Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God. 
5  But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all 
your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye 
seek, and thither thou shalt come: 
 
6  and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, 
and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, 
and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of 
your flocks: 
 
7  and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God, and ye shall 
rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, 
wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee. 
8  Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every 
man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. 
9  For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which 
the Lord your God giveth you. 
10  But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord 
your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all 
your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 
 
11  then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose 
to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I 
 
command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your 
 
tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice 
vows which ye vow unto the Lord: 
 
12  and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and your sons, 
and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, 
and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no 
 
part nor inheritance with you.
