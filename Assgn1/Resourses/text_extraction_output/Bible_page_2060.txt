  2061    Matthew 18 
19  Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as 
touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of 
my Father which is in heaven. 
20  For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am 
I in the midst of them. 
The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant

pay the debt. 
31  So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very
