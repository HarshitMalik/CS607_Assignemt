  2542    2 Timothy 4 
3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; 
 
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, 
having itching ears; 
 
4  and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be 
turned unto fables. 
5  But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an 
evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. 
6  ¶ For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is 
at hand. 
7  I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept 
the faith: 
 
8  henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which 
the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to 
 
me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 
Personal Instructions 
9  ¶ Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 
 
10  for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and 
is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto 
 
Dalmatia. 
11  Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he 
 
is profitable to me for the ministry. 
12  And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. 
13  The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring 
with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments. 
14  Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him 
 
according to his works: 
 
15  of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our 
 
words. 
16  At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I 
 
pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. 
17  Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; 
 
that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the
