Stabilization is the final stage of escape from the profane,
the  foundation  of  attaining  the  Way,  the  accomplishment
of  cultivated  stillness,  the  consummation  of  maintaining
calm.
When  the  body  is  like  a  withered  tree,  the  mind  like
dead  ashes,  without  reactivity,  without  seeking  anything,
this is the epitome of tranquillity. There is no mindfulness
of stabilization, yet there is no instability. Thus it is called
tranquil stabilization.
Chuang-tzu  said,  “One  whose  capacity  is  tranquilly
stabilized  radiates  natural  light.”  Capacity  refers  to  the
mind;  natural  light  is  active  insight.  The  mind  is  a
capacitor of the Way; when it is as uncluttered and quiet as
can be, then the Way stays there and insight emerges.
Insight  comes  from  original  nature;  one  does  not  just
come to have it now. That is why it is called natural light.
It  is  just  because  of  the  muddling  confusion  caused  by
craving  that  it  comes  to  be  obscure.  Clean  it,  make  it
flexible,  rectify  it,  and  restore  it  to  purity  and  calm,  and
the  original  real  conscious  spirit  will  gradually  become
clear  of  itself;  this  does  not  mean  that  you  are  just  now
producing that insight.
Once  insight  has  emerged,  treasure  it  and  do  not
compromise stability by too many concerns. It is not that
producing  insight  is  difficult;  being  insightful  but  not
using it is hard. Since ancient times there have been many
people who have forgotten their bodies but few who have
forgotten  their  reputations.  Being  insightful  but  not  using
