  437    Deuteronomy 12 
23  then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and 
ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. 
24  Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be 
yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river 
 
Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. 
25  There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the Lord your 
 
God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land 
that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you. 
26  Â¶ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
 
27  a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, 
which I command you this day: 
 
28  and a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord 
your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this 
day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. 
29  And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God hath brought 
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou 
shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon 
mount Ebal.  
30  Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun 
goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the 
champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 
 
31  For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the 
Lord your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell 
therein. 
32  And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I 
set before you this day. 
12 
Only One Place of Worship 
1  These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do 
in the land, which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to 
possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
