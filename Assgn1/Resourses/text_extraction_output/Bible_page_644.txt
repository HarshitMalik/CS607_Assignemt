  645    1 Samuel 13 
22  For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: 
 
because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people. 
23  Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord 
in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the 
 
right way: 
 
24  only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for 
 
consider how great things he hath done for you. 
25  But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and 
your king.

War with the Philistines 
1  Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over 
 
Israel, 
2  Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand 
 
were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand 
were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the 
 
people he sent every man to his tent. 
3  And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in 
Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet 
throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
4  And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the 
Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the 
Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. 
5  ¶ And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with 
Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and 
people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they 
 
came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven. 
6  When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the 
people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in 
caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
