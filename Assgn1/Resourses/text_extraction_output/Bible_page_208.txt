  209    Exodus 34 
23  Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the 
Lord God, the God of Israel. 
24  For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: 
 
neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to 
appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year. 
25  ¶ Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; 
 
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the 
morning.  
26  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the 
house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his 
mother’s milk.  
Moses and the Tables of the Law 
27  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after 
 
the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with 
Israel. 
28  And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did 
 
neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables 
the words of the covenant, the ten commandments [heb. words]. 
29  ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai 
with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came 
down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face 
shone while he talked with him. 
30  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, 
the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
 
31  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the 
 
congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
 
32  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave 
 
them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in 
mount Sinai. 
33  And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his 
face.
