31  ¶ And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before 
there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

his city was Avith. 
36  And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
37  And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his

38  And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his 
stead. 
39  And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his 
stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was 
   
Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 
40  ¶ And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according 
to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah,

41  duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 
42  duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 
43  duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to 
 
their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the 
 
father of the Edomites.
