  2071    Matthew 22 
42  ¶ Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures, 
The stone which the builders rejected, 
the same is become the head of the corner: 
 
this is the Lord’s doing, 
and it is marvelous in our eyes? 
 
43  Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from 
you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. 
44  And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on 
 
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. 
45  ¶ And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, 
they perceived that he spake of them. 
46  But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the 
multitude, because they took him for a prophet. 
22 
The Parable of the Marriage Feast 
1  And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and 
said, 
2  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a 
marriage for his son, 
3  and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the 
wedding: and they would not come. 
 
4  Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are 
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my 
 
fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. 
 
5  But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, 
another to his merchandise: 
 
6  and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, 
and slew them. 
7  But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth 
 
his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their 
city.
