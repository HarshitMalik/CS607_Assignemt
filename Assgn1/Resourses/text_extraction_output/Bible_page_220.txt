  221    Exodus 39 
30  And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of 
the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, 
and all the vessels of the altar, 
31  and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the 
court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the 
court round about.

The Making of the Priests’ Garments 
1  And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of 
service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments 
for Aaron; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
2  ¶ And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and 
fine twined linen. 
3  And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to 
work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the 
fine linen, with cunning work. 
4  They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two 
 
edges was it coupled together. 
5  And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the 
same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and 
 
scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
6  ¶ And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, 
as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 
7  And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be 
stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses. 
8  ¶ And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of 
the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined 
 
linen. 
9  It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the 
   
length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.
