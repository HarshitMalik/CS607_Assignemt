  1751    Lamentations 5 
Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. 
21  Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, 
that dwellest in the land of Uz; 
 
the cup also shall pass through unto thee: 
 
thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 
22  The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of 
Zion; 
 
he will no more carry thee away into captivity: 
 
he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; 
 
he will discover thy sins.

A Prayer for Mercy 
1  Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: 
 
consider, and behold our reproach. 
2  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, 
our houses to aliens. 
3  We are orphans and fatherless, 
our mothers are as widows. 
4  We have drunken our water for money; 
 
our wood is sold unto us. 
5  Our necks are under persecution: 
 
we labor, and have no rest. 
6  We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, 
to be satisfied with bread. 
7  Our fathers have sinned, and are not; 
 
and we have borne their iniquities. 
8  Servants have ruled over us: 
 
there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. 
9  We gat our bread with the peril of our lives, 
because of the sword of the wilderness. 
10  Our skin was black like an oven, 
because of the terrible famine.
