  1714    Jeremiah 45 
25  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your 
 
wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your 
hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have 
vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out 
drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and 
 
surely perform your vows. 
26  Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the 
land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the 
 
Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any 
man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord God liveth. 
27  Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all 
 
the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by 
the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 
28  Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the 
land of Egypt into the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, 
 
that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know 
whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. 
29  And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the Lord, that I will punish 
you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely 
stand against you for evil: 
 
30  Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of 
 
Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that 
seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of 
 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his 
life.
