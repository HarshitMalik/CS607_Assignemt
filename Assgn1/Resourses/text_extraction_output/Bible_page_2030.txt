  2031    Matthew 9 
33  And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, 
and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the 
devils. 
34  And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they 
 
saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their 
coasts.

Jesus Heals a Palsied Man 
1  And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own 
city. 
2  And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on 
a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; 
   
Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. 
 
3  And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This 
man blasphemeth. 
4  And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in 
your hearts? 
 
5  For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, 
 
Arise, and walk? 
 
6  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to 
forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up 
thy bed, and go unto thine house. 
7  And he arose, and departed to his house. 
8  But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled, and glorified God, 
which had given such power unto men. 
The Call of Matthew 
9  Â¶ And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named 
Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, 
 
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
