  2458    2 Corinthians 2 
23  ¶ Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I 
came not as yet unto Corinth. 
24  Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of 
your joy: for by faith ye stand.

1  But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to 
you in heaviness. 
2  For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but 
the same which is made sorry by me? 
 
3  And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have 
sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence 
 
in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. 
4  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you 
with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might 
 
know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 
Forgiveness for the Offender 
5  ¶ But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: 
 
that I may not overcharge you all. 
6  Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of 
many. 
7  So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort 
him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with 
overmuch sorrow. 
8  Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward 
him. 
9  For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, 
whether ye be obedient in all things. 
10  To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any 
 
thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person 
of Christ;
