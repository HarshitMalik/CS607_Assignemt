  1346    Psalms 106 
28  They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, 
and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
29  Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: 
 
and the plague brake in upon them. 
30  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: 
 
and so the plague was stayed. 
31  And that was counted unto him for righteousness 
unto all generations for evermore.  
32  They angered him also at the waters of strife, 
so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 
 
33  because they provoked his spirit, 
so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.  
34  They did not destroy the nations, 
concerning whom the Lord commanded them: 
 
35  but were mingled among the heathen, 
and learned their works. 
36  And they served their idols: 
 
which were a snare unto them.  
37  Yea, they sacrificed their sons 
and their daughters unto devils,  
38  and shed innocent blood, 
even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, 
whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: 
 
and the land was polluted with blood.  
39  Thus were they defiled with their own works, 
and went a whoring with their own inventions. 
40  Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, 
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
41  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; 
 
and they that hated them ruled over them. 
42  Their enemies also oppressed them, 
and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
43  Many times did he deliver them; 
 
but they provoked him with their counsel, 
and were brought low for their iniquity.
