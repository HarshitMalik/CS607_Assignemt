tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: 
   
not knowing what he said. 
34  While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: 
 
and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
35  And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved 
Son: hear him.  
 
36  And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept 
it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which 
they had seen. 
Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit 
37  ¶ And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come 
down from the hill, much people met him. 
38  And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I 
beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is mine only child. 
 
39  And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it 
 
teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him, hardly 
departeth from him. 
40  And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
 
41  And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how 
long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. 
 
42  And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare 
him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, 
and delivered him again to his father. 
43  And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. 
Jesus Again Foretells His Death 
¶ But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, 
he said unto his disciples, 
44  Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall 
 
be delivered into the hands of men. 
45  But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that 
they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
