  1596    Isaiah 59 
The Observance of the Sabbath 
13  ¶ If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy 
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of 
 
the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own 
 
ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own 
words: 
 
14  then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to 
 
ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the 
heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath 
 
spoken it. 
59 
A Confession of National Wickedness 
1  Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; 
 
neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 
 
2  but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and 
your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. 
3  For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with 
iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered 
 
perverseness. 
4  None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in 
 
vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth 
 
iniquity. 
5  They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that 
 
eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out 
into a viper. 
6  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover 
themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and 
 
the act of violence is in their hands. 
7  Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: 
 
their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are 
 
in their paths.
