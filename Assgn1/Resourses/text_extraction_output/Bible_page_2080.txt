  2081    Matthew 25 
5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
6  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom 
cometh; go ye out to meet him. 
 
7  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
8  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our 
 
lamps are gone out. 
9  But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for 
 
us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for 
 
yourselves. 
10  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that 
 
were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was 
 
shut. 
11  Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to 
us. 
12  But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.  
13  Watch therefore; for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein 
 
the Son of man cometh. 
The Parable of the Talents 
14  ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, 
who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 
15  And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another 
one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway 
   
took his journey. 
16  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the 
same, and made them other five talents. 
17  And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. 
18  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid 
his lord’s money. 
19  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth 
with them. 
20  And so he that had received five talents came and brought other 
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: 
 
behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
