  2450    1 Corinthians 15 
39  Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak 
with tongues. 
40  Let all things be done decently and in order.

The Resurrection of the Dead 
1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached 
unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
 
2  by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached 
unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
3  ¶ For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, 
how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;  
 
4  and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day 
according to the Scriptures:  
 
5  and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  
 
6  after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of 
 
whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are 
fallen asleep. 
7  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 
 
8  And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due 
time. 
9  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an 
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  
10  But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was 
 
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly 
 
than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
 
11  Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye 
believed. 
12  ¶ Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say 
some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
 
13  But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 
 
14  and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith 
is also vain.
