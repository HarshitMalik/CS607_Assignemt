  569    Judges 6 
21  Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was 
in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and 
 
there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the 
unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his 
sight. 
22  And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, 
Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of 
 
the Lord face to face. 
23  And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou 
   
shalt not die. 
24  Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it 
Jehovah-shalom [the Lord send peace]: unto this day it is yet in 
 
Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
25  ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, 
Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven 
years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, 
and cut down the grove that is by it: 
 
26  and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this 
rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a 
burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut 
down. 
27  Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord 
had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s 
 
household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, 
that he did it by night. 
28  ¶ And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, 
the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that 
was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was 
built. 
29  And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And 
 
when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash 
hath done this thing. 
30  Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he 
may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because 
 
he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
