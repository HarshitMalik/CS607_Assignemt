9. “And also many other heroes who have given up their lives for my sake, armed with
various weapons and missiles, all well skilled in battle.
Aparyaaptam tad asmaakam balam bheeshmaabhirakshitam;
Paryaaptam twidam eteshaam balam bheemaabhirakshitam.
10. “This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient, whereas their army,
marshalled by Bhima, is sufficient.
Ayaneshu cha sarveshu yathaabhaagam avasthitaah;
Bheeshmam evaabhirakshantu bhavantah sarva eva hi.
11. “Therefore, do ye all, stationed in your respective positions in the several divisions of
the army, protect Bhishma alone”.
Tasya sanjanayan harsham kuruvriddhah pitaamahah;

12. His glorious grandsire (Bhishma), the eldest of the Kauravas, in order to cheer
Duryodhana, now roared like a lion and blew his conch.

Sahasaivaabhyahanyanta sa shabdastumulo’bhavat.
13. Then (following Bhishma), conches and kettle-drums, tabors, drums and cow-horns
blared forth quite suddenly (from the side of the Kauravas); and the sound was tremendous.
Tatah shvetair hayair yukte mahati syandane sthitau;
Maadhavah paandavashchaiva divyau shankhau pradadhmatuh.
14. Then also, Madhava (Krishna), and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), seated in their
magnificent chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conches.

15. Hrishikesa blew the “Panchajanya” and Arjuna blew the “Devadatta”, and Bhima, the
doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch, “Paundra”.
Anantavijayam raajaa kunteeputro yudhishthirah;
Nakulah sahadevashcha sughoshamanipushpakau.
16. Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew the “Anantavijaya”; and Sahadeva and Nakula blew
the “Manipushpaka” and “Sughosha” conches.
