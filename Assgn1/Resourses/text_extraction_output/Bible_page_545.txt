  546    Joshua 22 
this day from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an 
altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord?  
 
17  Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not 
cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the 
congregation of the Lord,  
18  but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? and 
 
it will be, seeing ye rebel today against the Lord, that tomorrow he 
will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 
19  Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then 
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein 
the Lord’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but 
 
rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in building you an 
altar besides the altar of the Lord our God. 
20  Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed 
thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that 
 
man perished not alone in his iniquity.  
21  ¶ Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half 
tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the 
thousands of Israel, 
22  The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and 
Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression 
 
against the Lord, (save us not this day,) 
23  that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord, or if 
to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace 
offerings thereon, let the Lord himself require it; 
 
24  and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In 
time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, 
What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel? 
 
25  For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye 
children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the 
 
Lord: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing 
 
the Lord. 
26  Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for 
burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
