  899    2 Kings 25 
17  And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king 
in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.  
The Reign of Zedekiah 
18  ¶ Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, 
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name 
was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
19  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to 
all that Jehoiakim had done. 
20  For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and 
Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah 
rebelled against the king of Babylon.  
25 
The Fall of Jerusalem 
1  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth 
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of 
Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched 
against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
 
2  And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
3  And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in 
the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. 
4  And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by 
the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s 
garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and 
   
the king went the way toward the plain. 
5  And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook 
him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from 
 
him. 
6  So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon 
to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
