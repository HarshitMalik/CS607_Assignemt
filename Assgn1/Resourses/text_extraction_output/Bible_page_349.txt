  350    Numbers 16 
19  And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the 
 
Lord appeared unto all the congregation. 
20  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
21  Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may 
consume them in a moment. 
22  And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the 
spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with 
all the congregation? 
 
23  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
24  Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the 
tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
25  ¶ And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the 
 
elders of Israel followed him. 
26  And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, 
from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, 
lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 
27  So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, 
on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the 
 
door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little 
children. 
28  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me 
to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. 
 
29  If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited 
after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me. 
 
30  But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, 
and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they 
go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these 
 
men have provoked the Lord. 
31  ¶ And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these 
words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 
 
32  and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and 
their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all 
their goods.
