  808    1 Kings 15 
22  Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none 
 
was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the 
 
timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built 
 
with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
23  The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, 
and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of 
the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of 
 
his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
24  And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in 
the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his 
 
stead. 
The Reign of Nadab 
25  ¶ And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the 
second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
26  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of 
his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 
27  ¶ And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired 
against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged 
 
to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. 
 
28  Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and 
reigned in his stead. 
29  And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of 
Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had 
 
destroyed him, according unto the saying of the Lord, which he 
spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:  
 
30  because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he 
made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the 
Lord God of Israel to anger. 
31  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
32  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their 
days.
