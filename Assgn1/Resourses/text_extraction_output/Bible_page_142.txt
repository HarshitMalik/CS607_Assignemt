32  And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he 
let the people go.

The Plague on the Cattle 
1  Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, 
Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that 
they may serve me. 
2  For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 
3  behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the 
field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the 
oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. 
 
4  And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle 
of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children’s of 
 
Israel. 
5  And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the Lord 
shall do this thing in the land. 
6  And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of 
Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 
 
7  And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of 
the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he 
did not let the people go. 
The Plague of Boils 
8  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you 
handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward 
the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
9  And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be 
a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, 
throughout all the land of Egypt.
