  1079    Nehemiah 2 
9  but if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; 
 
though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the 
heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them 
unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.  
10  Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast 
redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
11  O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer 
of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear 
thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant 
 
him mercy in the sight of this man. 
¶ For I was the king’s cupbearer.

Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem 
1  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of 
Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the 
 
wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad 
in his presence. 
2  Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, 
seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. 
 
Then I was very sore afraid, 
3  and said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not 
 
my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ 
sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with 
fire? 
 
4  Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I 
 
prayed to the God of heaven. 
5  And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant 
have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto 
Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it. 
6  And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For 
how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it 
   
pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
