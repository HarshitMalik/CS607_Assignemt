  1372    Psalms 119 
159  Consider how I love thy precepts: 
 
quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving-kindness. 
160  Thy word is true from the beginning: 
 
and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. 
schin 
161  Princes have persecuted me without a cause: 
 
but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. 
162  I rejoice at thy word, 
as one that findeth great spoil. 
163  I hate and abhor lying: 
 
but thy law do I love. 
164  Seven times a day do I praise thee, 
because of thy righteous judgments. 
165  Great peace have they which love thy law: 
 
and nothing shall offend them. 
166  Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, 
and done thy commandments. 
167  My soul hath kept thy testmonies; 
 
and I love them exceedingly. 
168  I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: 
 
for all my ways are before thee. 
tau 
169  Let my cry come near before thee, O Lord: 
 
give me understanding according to thy word. 
170  Let my supplication come before thee: 
 
deliver me according to thy word. 
171  My lips shall utter praise, 
when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 
172  My tongue shall speak of thy word: 
 
for all thy commandments are righteousness. 
173  Let thine hand help me; 
 
for I have chosen thy precepts. 
174  I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; 
 
and thy law is my delight. 
175  Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee;
