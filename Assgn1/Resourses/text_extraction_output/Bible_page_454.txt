  455    Deuteronomy 20 
The Law concerning Witnesses 
15  Â¶ One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or 
for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two 
 
witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be 
established.  
16  If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that 
which is wrong; 
 
17  then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand 
before the Lord, before the priests and the judges, which shall be 
in those days; 
 
18  and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the 
 
witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his 
brother; 
 
19  then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his 
brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 
 
20  And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth 
commit no more any such evil among you. 
21  And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, 
 
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

The Laws concerning War 
1  When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest 
horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of 
them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up 
 
out of the land of Egypt. 
2  And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the 
priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 
3  and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto 
battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and 
 
do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
