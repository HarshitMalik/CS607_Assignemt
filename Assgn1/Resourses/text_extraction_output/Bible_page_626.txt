  627    1 Samuel 4 
17  And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I 
 
pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if 
 
thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto 
thee. 
18  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And 
he said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good. 
 
19  ¶ And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none 
of his words fall to the ground. 
20  And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was 
established to be a prophet of the Lord. 
21  And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed 
 
himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.

The Philistines Capture the Ark 
1  And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. 
¶ Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched 
beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. 
 
2  And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and 
 
when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: 
 
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 
3  And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel 
said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the 
Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of 
 
Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out 
of the hand of our enemies. 
4  So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the 
ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between 
the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were 
 
there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
5  ¶ And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the 
camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang 
again.
