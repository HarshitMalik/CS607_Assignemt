  711    2 Samuel 8 
24  For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people 
unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord, art become their God. 
 
25  And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning 
thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do 
as thou hast said. 
26  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts 
is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be 
 
established before thee. 
27  For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy 
servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy 
 
servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. 
28  And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true, 
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
 
29  therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, 
that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, 
 
hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be 
 
blessed for ever.

David Extends His Kingdom 
1  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and 
subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of 
 
the Philistines. 
2  ¶ And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting 
them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put 
 
to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites 
became David’s servants, and brought gifts. 
3  ¶ David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as 
he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. 
4  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred 
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all 
 
the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
