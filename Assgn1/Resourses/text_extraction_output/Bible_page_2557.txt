  2558    Hebrews 7 
10  For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, 
which ye have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered 
to the saints, and do minister. 
11  And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to 
the full assurance of hope unto the end: 
 
12  that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith 
and patience inherit the promises. 
13  Â¶ For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear 
by no greater, he sware by himself, 
14  saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will 
multiply thee.  
15  And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
16  For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation 
 
is to them an end of all strife. 
17  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of 
promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 
 
18  that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God 
to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge 
to lay hold upon the hope set before us: 
 
19  which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and 
steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;  
 
20  whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high 
priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  
7 
The Priestly Order of Melchizedek 
1  For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, 
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and 
blessed him; 
 
2  to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by 
 
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of 
Salem, which is, King of peace;
