  2198    Luke 12 
15  And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for 
 
a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he 
possesseth. 
16  And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain 
rich man brought forth plentifully: 
 
17  and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I 
have no room where to bestow my fruits? 
 
18  And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build 
 
greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 
 
19  And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for 
many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 
 
20  But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be 
required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast 
 
provided? 
 
21  So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward 
God. 
Care and Anxiety 
22  ¶ And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no 
thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what 
 
ye shall put on. 
23  The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. 
24  Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither 
   
have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more 
   
are ye better than the fowls? 
 
25  And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one 
cubit? 
 
26  If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye 
thought for the rest? 
 
27  Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and 
   
yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed 
like one of these.
