  774    1 Kings 6 
6 
Solomon Builds the House of the Lord 
1  And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the 
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth 
year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the 
second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord. 
2  And the house which king Solomon built for the Lord, the length 
thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, 
and the height thereof thirty cubits. 
3  And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was

the oracle: and he made chambers round about. 
 
6  The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was 
six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without 
 
in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that 
the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 
7  ¶ And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made 
ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither 
 
hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it 
was in building. 
8  ¶ The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the 
house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle 
 
chamber, and out of the middle into the third. 
9  So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with 
 
beams and boards of cedar. 
10  And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: 
 
and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. 
11  ¶ And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
