  247    Leviticus 9 
12  ¶ And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto 
 
him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 
13  And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces 
thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. 
 
14  And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the 
burnt offering on the altar. 
15  ¶ And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which 
was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for 
sin, as the first. 
16  And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the 
manner. 
17  And he brought the meat offering, and took a handful thereof, and 
burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning. 
18  ¶ He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace 
offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented 
 
unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round 
about, 
19  and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which 
covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: 
 
20  and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the 
altar: 
 
21  and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave 
offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded. 
 
22  ¶ And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed 
them; and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the 
 
burnt offering, and peace offerings. 
23  And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory 
 
of the Lord appeared unto all the people. 
24  And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed 
upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the 
 
people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
