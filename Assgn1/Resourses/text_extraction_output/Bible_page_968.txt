  969    1 Chronicles 29 
19  All this, said David, the Lord made me understand in writing by his 
hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. 
20  Â¶ And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good 
courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, 
 
even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake 
 
thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the 
house of the Lord. 
21  And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they 
shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there 
 
shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing 
skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the 
 
people will be wholly at thy commandment. 
29 
1  Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, 
Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and 
tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for 
 
the Lord God. 
2  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God 
the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of 
silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, 
and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, 
 
glistering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious 
stones, and marble stones in abundance.  
3  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I 
have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have 
given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have 
prepared for the holy house, 
4  even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven 
thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses 
withal: 
 
5  the gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for 
all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who 
then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?
