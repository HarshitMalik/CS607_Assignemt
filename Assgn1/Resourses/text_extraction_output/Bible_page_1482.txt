  1483    Song of Solomon 3 
he feedeth among the lilies. 
17  Until the day break, 
and the shadows flee away, 
turn, my beloved, 
and be thou like a roe or a young hart 
upon the mountains of Bether.

The Bride’s Reverie 
1  By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: 
 
I sought him, but I found him not. 
2  I will rise now, and go about the city 
in the streets, and in the broad ways 
I will seek him whom my soul loveth: 
 
I sought him, but I found him not. 
3  The watchmen that go about the city found me: 
 
to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 
 
4  It was but a little that I passed from them, 
but I found him whom my soul loveth: 
 
I held him, and would not let him go, 
until I had brought him into my mother’s house, 
and into the chamber of her that conceived me. 
5  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, 
by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, 
that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, 
till he please. 
The Wedding Procession 
6  Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, 
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, 
with all powders of the merchant? 
 
7  Behold his bed, which is Solomon’s;
