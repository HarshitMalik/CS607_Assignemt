  294    Leviticus 26 
The Consequences of Disobedience 
14  ¶ But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these 
commandments; 
 
15  and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my 
judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that 
ye break my covenant: 
 
16  I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, 
 
consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, 
and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for 
 
your enemies shall eat it. 
17  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your 
enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee 
   
when none pursueth you. 
18  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will 
punish you seven times more for your sins. 
19  And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your 
 
heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 
 
20  and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not 
 
yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their 
fruits. 
21  ¶ And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I 
 
will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your 
sins. 
22  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your 
children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; 
 
and your high ways shall be desolate. 
23  ¶ And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will 
walk contrary unto me; 
 
24  then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet 
seven times for your sins. 
25  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of 
my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, 
 
I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into 
 
the hand of the enemy.
