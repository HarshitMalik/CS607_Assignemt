  46    Genesis 21 
15  ¶ And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child 
under one of the shrubs. 
16  And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as 
it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the 
 
child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and 
wept. 
17  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to 
 
Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? 
 
fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
 
18  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make 
 
him a great nation. 
19  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she 
 
went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
20  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the 
 
wilderness, and became an archer. 
21  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him 
 
a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
The Covenant between Abraham and Abimelech 
22  ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the 
chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with 
thee in all that thou doest: 
 
23  now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not deal 
falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but 
 
according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do 
unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
24  And Abraham said, I will swear. 
25  ¶ And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, 
which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 
26  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither 
 
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today. 
27  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto 
Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
 
28  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
