  2572    Hebrews 13 
21  and so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and 
quake:)  
 
22  but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living 
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of 
angels, 
23  to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are 
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of 
just men made perfect, 
24  and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of 
sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.  
25  Â¶ See that ye refuse not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not 
 
who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we 
escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 
 
26  whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, 
 
saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  
27  And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those 
things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things 
which cannot be shaken may remain. 
28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us 
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence 
and godly fear: 
 
29  for our God is a consuming fire.

Service Well-pleasing to God 
1  Let brotherly love continue. 
2  Be not fogtful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have 
 
entertained angels unawares.  
3  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them 
 
which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 
4  Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but 
 
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
