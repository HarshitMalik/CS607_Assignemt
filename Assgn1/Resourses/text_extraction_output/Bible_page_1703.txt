  1704    Jeremiah 40 
carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried 
away captive unto Babylon. 
2  And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, 
The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 
3  Now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: 
 
because ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed his 
voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. 
4  And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were 
upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into 
Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill 
   
unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the 
 
land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for 
 
thee to go, thither go. 
5  Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to 
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of 
Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell 
with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth 
 
convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him 
victuals and a reward, and let him go. 
6  Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; 
 
and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. 
7  Â¶ Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, 
even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made 
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had 
committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the 
poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to 
Babylon; 
 
8  then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of 
Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and 
Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the 
Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and 
their men. 
9  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto 
them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans:
