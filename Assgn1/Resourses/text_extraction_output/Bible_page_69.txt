3  And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall 
 
bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 
4  And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in 
 
unto her. 
5  And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
6  And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my 
voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan 
 
[judging]. 
7  And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second 
son. 
8  And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my 
sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali [my 
 
wrestling]. 
9  ¶ When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her 
maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
10  And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son. 
11  And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. 
 
12  And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son. 
13  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: 
 
and she called his name Asher [happy]. 
14  ¶ And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found 
mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. 
Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s 
mandrakes. 
15  And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my 
husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? 
   
And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy 
son’s mandrakes. 
16  And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out 
to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I 
 
have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that 
night. 
17  And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob 
the fifth son.
