of sages.” That is, when educating children, if you present
them  with  emulation  of  sages,  how  can  people  not  exert
themselves in emulation of sages?
Lao-tzu  said,  “When  you  cultivate  your  own  person,
that virtue is real.” To speak of cultivation abandoning the
person  is  false.  Nowadays  people  who  seek  wizardry  or
buddhahood often cut themselves off from society and flee
the  world  in  their  quest.  They  consider  it  burdensome  to
have a home, to have a wife and children, to have business
with  people;  they  believe  they  cannot  attain  wizardry  or
buddhahood on that account, and so they think they must
cut  themselves  off  from  society  and  flee  the  world.  They
do not realize that the Way of wizards and buddhas is not
apart from body and mind.
If you can actually rectify your mind and cultivate your
body, then if you have a house you can live there, if you
have a wife and children you can enjoy them, if you have
dealings with people you can use them for refinement. So
householders too can become sages, wizards, and buddhas
—why  should  it  be  necessary  to  abandon  what  is  very
convenient and do what is inconvenient?
LEARNING
Learning  is  the  journey  to  the  Way.  The  classics  of  the
sages  and  traditions  of  the  wise  are  the  tickets  for  the
journey.
