undone.  If  it  profits  oneself,  one  will  do  it  even  if  it  is
damaging to the health.
How great is the harm of egoism! Only when there is no
egoism  is  selfishness  transformed;  conduct  becomes
upright, and you also forget your physical body. What can
burden you then?
Search  within  your  body—what  is  the  ego?  Once  the
notion of self is not there, you attain great liberation.
Yongjia’s  Collection  says,  “If  ignorance  is  not
understood,  you  mistakenly  grasp  it  as  self.  When  the
notion of self is rigidly fixed, then greed, anger, and false
views  arbitrarily  conceive  existences,  giving  rise  to
attachments.
“When you know the body is illusory, you realize it has
no  independent  nature.  Matter  is  emptiness—who  is  the
self?
“All phenomena only have temporal definitions, without
any true reality. None of the four gross elements and five
clusters  is  the  self,  and  there  is  no  combination  either.
When  you  seek,  inside  and  out,  ultimately  there  is  no
person.”
Examine  the  Chinese  character  for  self  or  ego—it
consists  of  two  opposing  “weapon”  characters.  The
calamities of viciousness and violence all arise from ego.
Therefore those whose hearts are on the Way should first
be egoless.
