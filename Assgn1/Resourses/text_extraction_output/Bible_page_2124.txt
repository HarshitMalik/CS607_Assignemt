  2125    Mark 10 
Temptations to Sin 
42  ¶ And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in 
me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, 
and he were cast into the sea. 
43  And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter 
 
into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the 
fire that never shall be quenched:  
 
44  where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
45  And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter 
 
halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire 
that never shall be quenched: 
 
46  where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
47  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to 
 
enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes 
to be cast into hell fire:  
 
48  where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  
49  For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be 
salted with salt. 
50  Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye 
 
season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with 
 
another.

Jesus’ Teaching on Divorce 
1  And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judea by 
the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; 
   
and, as he was wont, he taught them again. 
2  ¶ And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a 
man to put away his wife? tempting him. 
 
3  And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command 
you?
