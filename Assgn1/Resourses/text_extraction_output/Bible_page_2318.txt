  2319    Acts 5 
13  And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people 
 
magnified them. 
14  And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of 
men and women;) 
 
15  insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid 
them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter 
passing by might overshadow some of them. 
16  There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto 
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with 
unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 
 
The Apostles Persecuted 
17  ¶ Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, 
(which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with 
indignation, 
18  and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common 
prison. 
19  But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and 
brought them forth, and said, 
20  Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this 
life. 
21  And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in 
the morning, and taught. 
¶ But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called 
the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and 
sent to the prison to have them brought. 
22  But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they 
returned, and told, 
23  saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the 
keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had 
 
opened, we found no man within. 
24  Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the 
chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto 
this would grow.
