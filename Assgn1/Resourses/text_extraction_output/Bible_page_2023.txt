  2024    Matthew 6 
15  but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father 
forgive your trespasses.  
Jesus’ Teaching on Fasting 
16  ¶ Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad 
countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear 
 
unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
17  But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 
 
18  that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is 
in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee 
 
openly. 
Treasure in Heaven 
19  ¶ Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and 
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 
 
20  but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth 
nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor 
steal: 
 
21  for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
The Light of the Body 
22  ¶ The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, 
 
thy whole body shall be full of light. 
23  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If 
therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that 
darkness! 
 
God and Mammon 
24  ¶ No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, 
 
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the 
 
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
