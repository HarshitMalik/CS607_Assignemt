  2562    Hebrews 9 
12  For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, 
and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.  
13  In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now 
that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. 
9 
1  Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, 
and a worldly sanctuary. 
2  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the 
 
candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the 
 
sanctuary. 
3  And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest 
of all;  
 
4  which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid 
round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had 
manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the 
covenant;  
 
5  and over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of 
 
which we cannot now speak particularly. 
6  ¶ Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went 
always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.  
7  But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not 
without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of 
the people:  
 
8  the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all 
was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet 
standing: 
 
9  which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered 
both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the 
service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; 
 
10  which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and 
carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
