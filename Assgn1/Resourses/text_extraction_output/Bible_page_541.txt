11  And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city 
is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof 
round about it. 
12  But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb 
the son of Jephunneh for his possession. 
13  ¶ Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with 
her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her 
 
suburbs, 
14  and Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs, 
15  and Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs, 
16  and Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Beth-
shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. 
 
17  And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba 
with her suburbs, 
18  Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four 
 
cities.

to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 
 
22  and Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs; 
 
four cities.

with her suburbs, 
24  Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; four 
 
cities.

and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities. 
 
26  All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the 
children of Kohath that remained.

out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan
