  2363    Acts 20 
33  And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting 
him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would 
have made his defense unto the people. 
34  But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the 
space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
35  And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men 
of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city 
of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of 
the image which fell down from Jupiter? 
 
36  Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to 
be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 
37  For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of 
churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. 
38  Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, 
have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are 
deputies: let them implead one another. 
 
39  But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be 
determined in a lawful assembly. 
40  For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, 
there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this 
concourse. 
41  And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

Paul’s Journey to Macedonia and Greece 
1  And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, 
and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. 
2  And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much 
exhortation, he came into Greece, 
3  and there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for 
him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return 
through Macedonia.
