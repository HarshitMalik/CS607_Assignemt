13  Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the 
Baptist. 
Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit 
14  ¶ And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a 
certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, 
15  Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for 
   
ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. 
16  And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 
17  Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, 
how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring 
   
him hither to me. 
18  And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the 
   
child was cured from that very hour. 
19  Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we 
cast him out? 
 
20  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say 
 
unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say 
unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall 
 
remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 
 
21  Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. 
Jesus Again Foretells His Death 
22  ¶ And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son 
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 
 
23  and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. 
And they were exceeding sorry. 
Payment of the Tribute Money 
24  ¶ And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received 
tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay 
tribute?
