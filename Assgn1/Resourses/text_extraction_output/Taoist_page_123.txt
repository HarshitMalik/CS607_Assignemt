One might try to bring it to rest but not succeed, or one
may  temporarily  succeed  but  then  lose  it  again.  In  the
struggle  to  keep  it  as  it  slips  away,  the  whole  body  runs
with sweat.
After  a  long  long  time  the  mind  becomes  flexible  but
straight;  only  then  is  it  fully  tuned.  Do  not  give  up
everyday work just because you are temporarily unable to
concentrate or control your mind.
As  soon  as  you  have  gained  a  little  calm,  then  you
should consciously stabilize it at all times, whether you are
walking,  standing,  sitting,  or  lying  down,  while  you  are
dealing with concrete matters and tasks, in the midst of the
hustle and bustle.
Whether there is something the matter or not, always be
as if mindless; whether in quietude or in a commotion, let
your will remain undivided.
If  you  control  your  mind  too  intensely,  the  stress  will
cause illness. Fits of insane idiocy are symptomatic of this.
If the mind is immobile, then you should let it go, finding
a mean between laxness and intensity.
Always  tune  yourself,  being  controlled  without
obsessing, being natural without indulging. When you can
be  in  the  midst  of  clamor  without  hating  it  and  can  deal
with things without vexation, this is true stability.
That does not mean, however, that you seek to be busy
just because you can deal with things without vexation, or
that you take to clamor just because you can be unmoved
in the midst of clamor.
