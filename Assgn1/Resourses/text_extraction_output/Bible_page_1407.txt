  1408    Proverbs 4 
4 
The Beneficence of Wisdom 
1  Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, 
and attend to know understanding. 
2  For I give you good doctrine, 
forsake ye not my law. 
3  For I was my fatherâ€™s son, 
tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 
4  He taught me also, and said unto me, 
Let thine heart retain my words: 
 
keep my commandments, and live. 
5  Get wisdom, get understanding: 
 
forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
 
6  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: 
 
love her, and she shall keep thee. 
7  Wisdom is the principal thing; 
 
therefore get wisdom: 
 
and with all thy getting get understanding. 
8  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: 
 
she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. 
9  She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: 
 
a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 
10  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; 
 
and the years of thy life shall be many. 
11  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; 
 
I have led thee in right paths. 
12  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; 
 
and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
13  Take fast hold of instruction; 
 
let her not go: 
 
keep her; for she is thy life. 
 
14  Enter not into the path of the wicked, 
and go not in the way of evil men.
