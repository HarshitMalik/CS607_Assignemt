  1731    Jeremiah 51 
12  Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch 
strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord 
 
hath both devised and done that which he spake against the 
inhabitants of Babylon. 
13  O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, 
thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. 
14  The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill 
thee with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout 
 
against thee. 
15  ¶ He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the 
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his 
understanding. 
16  When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the 
heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the 
 
earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind 
 
out of his treasures. 
17  Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is 
 
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, 
 
and there is no breath in them. 
18  They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation 
 
they shall perish. 
19  The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all 
 
things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is 
   
his name. 
20  ¶ Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I 
 
break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; 
 
21  and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and 
 
with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 
 
22  with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee 
 
will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in 
 
pieces the young man and the maid; 
 
23  I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and 
 
with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of 
oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
