  1037    2 Chronicles 31 
Hezekiah’s Provision for the Priests and Levites 
2  ¶ And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the 
Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the 
priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to 
minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents 
of the Lord. 
3  He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt 
offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and 
the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and 
for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord.  
4  Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to 
give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be 
encouraged in the law of the Lord. 
5  And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of 
Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, 
and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all 
 
things brought they in abundantly.  
6  And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the 
cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, 
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord 
their God, and laid them by heaps. 
7  In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, 
and finished them in the seventh month. 
8  And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they 
blessed the Lord, and his people Israel. 
9  Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites 
concerning the heaps. 
10  And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, 
and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house 
of the Lord, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for 
 
the Lord hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great 
 
store. 
11  ¶ Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of 
the Lord; and they prepared them,
