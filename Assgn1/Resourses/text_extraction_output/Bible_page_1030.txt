  1031    2 Chronicles 29 
6  For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the 
eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned 
away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their 
backs. 
7  Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the 
lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in 
the holy place unto the God of Israel. 
8  Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem, 
and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to 
hissing, as ye see with your eyes. 
9  For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our 
daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
10  Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of 
Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. 
11  My sons, be not now negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to 
 
stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto 
him, and burn incense. 
12  Â¶ Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the 
son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of 
 
Merari; Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and 
   
of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of 
 
Joah: 
 
13  and of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of 
   
Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 
   
14  and of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of 
   
Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. 
 
15  And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and 
came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of 
the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord. 
16  And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, 
to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in 
the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord. 
And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook 
Kidron.
