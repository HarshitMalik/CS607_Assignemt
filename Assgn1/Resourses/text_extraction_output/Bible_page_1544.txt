  1545    Isaiah 31 
26  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and 
the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in 
the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and 
healeth the stroke of their wound. 
The Lord’s Judgment on Assyria 
27  ¶ Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his 
anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of 
 
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 
 
28  and his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of 
the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall 
 
be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err. 
29  ¶ Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; 
 
and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into 
the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel. 
30  And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall 
show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his 
anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and 
tempest, and hailstones. 
31  For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten 
down, which smote with a rod. 
32  And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the 
Lord shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in 
 
battles of shaking will he fight with it. 
33  For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he 
   
hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; 
   
the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. 
31 
The Egyptians Are Men, Not God 
1  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, 
 
and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen,
