  2433    1 Corinthians 7 
Glorify God in Your Body 
12  ¶ All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all 
 
things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power 
of any. 
13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy 
 
both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the 
Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
 
14  And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by 
his own power. 
15  Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I 
 
then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of a 
harlot? God forbid. 
 
16  What! know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? 
   
for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  
17  But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
18  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; 
 
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
19  What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost 
 
which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
 
20  For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, 
 
and in your spirit, which are God’s.

Problems concerning Marriage 
1  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good 
 
for a man not to touch a woman. 
2  Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, 
and let every woman have her own husband. 
3  Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and 
 
likewise also the wife unto the husband.
