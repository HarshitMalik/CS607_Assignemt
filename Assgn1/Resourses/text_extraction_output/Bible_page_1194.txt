  1195    Job 39 
Or wilt thou leave thy labor to him? 
 
12  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, 
and gather it into thy barn? 
 
13  Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? 
 
or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 
 
14  which leaveth her eggs in the earth, 
and warmeth them in the dust, 
15  and forgetteth that the foot may crush them, 
or that the wild beast may break them. 
16  She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not 
hers: 
 
her labor is in vain without fear; 
 
17  because God hath deprived her of wisdom, 
neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
18  What time she lifteth up herself on high, 
she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
19  Hast thou given the horse strength? 
 
Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
 
20  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? 
 
The glory of his nostrils is terrible. 
21  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: 
 
he goeth on to meet the armed men. 
22  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; 
 
neither turneth he back from the sword. 
23  The quiver rattleth against him, 
the glittering spear and the shield. 
24  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: 
 
neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 
25  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! 
 
And he smelleth the battle afar off, 
the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
26  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, 
and stretch her wings toward the south? 
 
27  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, 
and make her nest on high?
