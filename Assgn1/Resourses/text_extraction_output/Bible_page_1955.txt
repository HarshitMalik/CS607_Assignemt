  1956    Micah 4 
and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for 
 
the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from 
Jerusalem. 
3  And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations 
afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their 
 
spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against 
 
nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
4  But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; 
 
and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of 
 
hosts hath spoken it. 
5  For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we 
will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. 
Israel’s Redemption from Captivity 
6  ¶ In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I 
will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; 
 
7  and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far 
off a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount 
 
Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
8  And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of 
Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the 
 
kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
9  ¶ Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy 
   
counselor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in 
 
travail. 
10  Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a 
woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and 
 
thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; 
 
there shalt thou be delivered; there the Lord shall redeem thee 
 
from the hand of thine enemies. 
11  ¶ Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let 
her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
