RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  CHAU-PADAS,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:   
To associate with evil demons is to live with snakes; I tried all sorts of things.  || 1 ||   
Then, I chanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I found intuitive peace.  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   Emotional attachment is worthless and false. I claimed for myself the possessions of 
others, sucked into the whirlpool of reincarnation.  || 2 ||   All are travellers, who have 
gathered under the tree, held by their many bonds.  || 3 ||   The Company of the Holy is 
stable  and  permanent;  there,  the  Kirtan  of  the  Lord‟s  Praises  are  sung.  Nanak  seeks 
Sanctuary.  || 4 || 1 ||

RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  NINTH MEHL:   
No one knows the state of the Lord. The Yogis, the celibates, the austere penitents, and all 
sorts of clever people have failed.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   In an instant, He changes the beggar 
into a king, and the king into a beggar. He fills what is empty, and empties what is full. 
Such are His ways.  || 1 ||   He Himself spread out the expanse of His Maya, and He 
Himself beholds it. He assumes so many forms, and plays so many games, and yet He 
remains distinct and detached from it all.  || 2 ||   Incalculable, infinite, incomprehensible 
and immaculate, He has misled the whole world. So give up all your doubts; prays Nanak, 
O mortal, focus your consciousness on His Feet.  || 3 || 1 || 2 ||    
RAAG BIHAAGRAA,  CHHANT,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:

NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; to the Gurmukh, the Name of the 
Lord is priceless. My mind is pierced by the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Name. The Lord 
is dear to my mind.
