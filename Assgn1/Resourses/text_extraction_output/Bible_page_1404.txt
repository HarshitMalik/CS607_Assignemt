  1405    Proverbs 3 
10  When wisdom entereth into thine heart, 
and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 
 
11  discretion shall preserve thee, 
understanding shall keep thee: 
 
12  to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, 
from the man that speaketh froward things; 
 
13  who leave the paths of uprightness, 
to walk in the ways of darkness; 
 
14  who rejoice to do evil, 
and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 
 
15  whose ways are crooked, 
and they froward in their paths: 
 
16  to deliver thee from the strange woman, 
even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; 
 
17  which forsaketh the guide of her youth, 
and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
18  For her house inclineth unto death, 
and her paths unto the dead. 
19  None that go unto her return again, 
neither take they hold of the paths of life. 
20  That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, 
and keep the paths of the righteous. 
21  For the upright shall dwell in the land, 
and the perfect shall remain in it. 
22  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, 
and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
