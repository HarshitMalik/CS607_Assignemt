  896    2 Kings 23 
25  And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the 
Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his 
might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose 
 
there any like him. 
26  ¶ Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his 
great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, 
because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him 
withal. 
27  And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I 
have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I 
have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be 
there. 
The Death of Josiah 
28  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
29  In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king 
of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; 
   
and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
30  And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and 
brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. 
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and 
anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead. 
The Reign and Dethronement of Jehoahaz 
31  ¶ Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; 
 
and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name 
was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
32  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to 
all that his fathers had done. 
33  And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of 
Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to 
 
a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
