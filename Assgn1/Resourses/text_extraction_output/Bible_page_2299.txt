  2300    John 19 
27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that 
 
hour that disciple took her unto his own home. 
28  ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, 
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. 
29  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge 
 
with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.  
30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is 
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. 
 
Jesus’ Side Pierced 
31  ¶ The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the 
bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for 
that sabbath day was a high day,) besought Pilate that their legs 
might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
32  Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the 
other which was crucified with him. 
33  But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, 
they brake not his legs: 
 
34  but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith 
came there out blood and water. 
35  And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true; and he 
 
knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. 
36  For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A 
bone of him shall not be broken.  
37  And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom 
they pierced.  
The Burial of Jesus 
38  ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but 
secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take 
away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came 
 
therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
