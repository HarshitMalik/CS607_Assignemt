  819    1 Kings 19 
7  And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and 
touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too 
 
great for thee. 
8  And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of 
that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of 
God. 
9  Â¶ And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, 
 
the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What 
doest thou here, Elijah? 
 
10  And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: 
 
for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down 
thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I 
 
only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  
 
11  And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. 
And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent 
the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but 
 
the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; 
   
but the Lord was not in the earthquake: 
 
12  and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: 
   
and after the fire a still small voice. 
13  And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his 
mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. 
And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest 
thou here, Elijah? 
 
14  And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: 
 
because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown 
down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, 
 
even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 
 
15  And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the 
wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to 
 
be king over Syria:  
 
16  and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: 
 
and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to 
be prophet in thy room.
