  146    Exodus 10 
34  And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders 
were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and 
his servants. 
35  And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the 
children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses. 
 
10 
The Plague of Locusts 
1  And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have 
 
hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show 
these my signs before him: 
 
2  and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s 
son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I 
have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the 
 
Lord. 
3  ¶ And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, 
Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou 
refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they 
 
may serve me. 
4  Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I 
bring the locusts into thy coast: 
 
5  and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to 
see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is 
 
escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat 
every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
 
6  and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and 
the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy 
 
fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the 
earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from 
Pharaoh. 
7  ¶ And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man 
be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord 
 
their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
