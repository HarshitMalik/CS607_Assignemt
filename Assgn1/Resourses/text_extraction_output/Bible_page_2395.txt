  2396    Romans 3 
the poison of asps is under their lips:  
 
14  whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:  
 
15  their feet are swift to shed blood: 
 
16  destruction and misery are in their ways: 
 
17  and the way of peace have they not known:  
 
18  there is no fear of God before their eyes.  
19  ¶ Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to 
them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, 
 
and all the world may become guilty before God. 
20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in 
his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 
 
Righteousness through Faith 
21  ¶ But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, 
being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
 
22  even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto 
all and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: 
   
23  for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
 
24  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in 
Christ Jesus: 
 
25  whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his 
blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are 
past, through the forbearance of God; 
 
26  to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be 
 
just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
27  ¶ Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? 
     
Nay; but by the law of faith. 
 
28  Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the 
deeds of the law. 
29  Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of 
   
the Gentiles also: 
 
30  seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, 
and uncircumcision through faith.
