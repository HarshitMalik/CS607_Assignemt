  1838    Ezekiel 37 
12  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; 
 
Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to 
come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
13  And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your 
graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 
14  and shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place 
you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have 
 
spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord. 
The Prophecy concerning the Reunion of Judah and Israel 
15  Â¶ The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
16  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, 
For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take 
 
another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, 
and for all the house of Israel his companions: 
 
17  and join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become 
 
one in thine hand. 
18  And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, 
Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these? 
 
19  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the 
 
stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of 
Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of 
Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine 
hand. 
20  And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before 
their eyes. 
21  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take 
 
the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be 
gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their 
own land: 
 
22  and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains 
of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be 
   
no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two 
kingdoms any more at all:
