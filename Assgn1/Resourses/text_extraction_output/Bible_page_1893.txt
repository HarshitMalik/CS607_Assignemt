  1894    Daniel 9 
26  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is 
true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many 
   
days. 
27  ¶ And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose 
 
up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, 
 
but none understood it.

Daniel’s Prayer for His People 
1  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the 
Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 
 
2  in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the 
number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to 
Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in 
the desolations of Jerusalem. 
3  ¶ And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and 
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 
 
4  and I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and 
said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and 
mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his 
commandments; 
 
5  we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done 
wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts 
and from thy judgments: 
 
6  neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which 
spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to 
all the people of the land. 
7  O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of 
faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of 
 
Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, 
through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because 
of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
