  1682    Jeremiah 31 
and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith 
 
the Lord. 
29  In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour 
grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.  
30  But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth 
 
the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. 
31  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new 
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
 
32  not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the 
day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of 
Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband 
 
unto them, saith the Lord: 
 
33  but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of 
Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their 
 
inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and 
 
they shall be my people. 
34  And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every 
man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know 
 
me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the 
Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their 
 
sin no more.  
35  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and 
the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, 
which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of 
 
hosts is his name: 
 
36  If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the 
seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for 
ever. 
37  Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the 
 
foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all 
the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the Lord. 
38  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built 
to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the 
corner.
