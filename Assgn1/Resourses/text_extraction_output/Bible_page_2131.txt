  2132    Mark 12 
Jesus’ Authority Questioned 
27  ¶ And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the 
 
temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the 
elders, 
28  and say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and 
 
who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
 
29  And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one 
question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do 
these things. 
30  The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. 
 
31  And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From 
heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
   
32  But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men 
   
counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. 
33  And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus 
answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority 
I do these things.

The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen 
1  And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man 
planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a place for 
the winevat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and 
went into a far country. 
2  And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he 
might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. 
3  And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. 
4  And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast 
 
stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away 
shamefully handled. 
5  And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; 
   
beating some, and killing some.
