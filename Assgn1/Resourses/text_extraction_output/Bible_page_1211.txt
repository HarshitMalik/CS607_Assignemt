  1212    Psalms 11 
to requite it with thy hand: 
 
the poor committeth himself unto thee; 
 
thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
15  Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: 
 
seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 
16  The Lord is King for ever and ever: 
 
the heathen are perished out of his land. 
17  Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: 
 
thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 
 
18  to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, 
that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

The Refuge of the Upright 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  In the Lord put I my trust: 
 
how say ye to my soul, 
Flee as a bird to your mountain? 
 
2  For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, 
they make ready their arrow upon the string, 
that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 
3  If the foundations be destroyed, 
what can the righteous do? 
 
4  The Lord is in his holy temple, 
the Lordâ€™s throne is in heaven: 
 
his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 
5  The Lord trieth the righteous: 
 
but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
6  Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, 
and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 
 
7  For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness;
