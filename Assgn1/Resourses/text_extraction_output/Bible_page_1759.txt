  1760    Ezekiel 5 
11  Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: 
 
from time to time shalt thou drink. 
12  And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with 
dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 
13  And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their 
defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. 
14  Then said I, Ah Lord God! behold, my soul hath not been 
 
polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of 
 
that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there 
 
abominable flesh into my mouth. 
15  Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s 
dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 
16  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the 
staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and 
 
with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with 
 
astonishment: 
 
17  that they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with 
another, and consume away for their iniquity. 
5 
1  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s 
razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: 
 
then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. 
2  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when 
the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, 
 
and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in 
 
the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 
 
3  Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy 
skirts. 
4  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, 
and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all 
 
the house of Israel. 
5  Thus saith the Lord God; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the 
   
midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.
