  827    1 Kings 22 
27  ¶ And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent 
his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in 
sackcloth, and went softly. 
28  And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
29  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he 
 
humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: 
 
but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.

Micaiah Prophesies the Defeat of Ahab and Jehoshaphat 
1  And they continued three years without war between Syria and 
Israel. 
2  And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of 
Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
3  And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth 
in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of 
the king of Syria? 
 
4  And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to 
Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as 
 
thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
5  ¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, 
at the word of the Lord today. 
6  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four 
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-
gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the 
   
Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
7  And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord 
besides, that we might inquire of him? 
 
8  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, 
Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the Lord: 
 
but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but 
 
evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
