  2222    Luke 20 
43  For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a 
trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on 
every side, 
44  and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within 
thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; 
   
because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. 
The Cleansing of the Temple 
45  ¶ And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that 
sold therein, and them that bought; 
 
46  saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer; 
 
but ye have made it a den of thieves.  
47  ¶ And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the 
scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 
48  and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very 
 
attentive to hear him.

Jesus’ Authority Questioned 
1  And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the 
people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and 
the scribes came upon him with the elders, 
2  and spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou 
these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
   
3  And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; 
 
and answer me: 
 
4  The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 
 
5  And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From 
heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
   
6  But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be 
   
persuaded that John was a prophet. 
7  And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
