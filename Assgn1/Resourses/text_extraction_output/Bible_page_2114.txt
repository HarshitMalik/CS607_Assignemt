  2115    Mark 7 
47  And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and 
he alone on the land. 
48  And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto 
 
them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto 
 
them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. 
49  But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had 
been a spirit, and cried out: 
 
50  for they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he 
talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be 
   
not afraid. 
51  And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and 
   
they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and 
wondered. 
52  For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for their heart was 
 
hardened. 
Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret 
53  Â¶ And when they had passed over, they came into the land of 
Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. 
54  And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew 
him, 
55  and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry 
about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 
56  And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, 
they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might 
touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as 
 
touched him were made whole.
