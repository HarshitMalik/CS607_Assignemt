  26    Genesis 11 
19  and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and 
begat sons and daughters. 
20  ¶ And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
 
21  and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, 
and begat sons and daughters. 
22  ¶ And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
 
23  and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat 
sons and daughters. 
24  ¶ And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
 
25  and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, 
and begat sons and daughters. 
26  ¶ And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and 
Haran. 
The Descendants of Terah 
27  ¶ Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, 
 
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
 
28  And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, 
in Ur of the Chaldees. 
29  And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife 
 
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of 
 
Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
30  But Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
 
31  ¶ And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his 
son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and 
 
they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the 
land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
 
32  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah 
 
died in Haran.
