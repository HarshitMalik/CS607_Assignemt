  1550    Isaiah 34 
21  But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers 
and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall 
 
gallant ship pass thereby. 
22  For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is 
our King; he will save us. 
 
23  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast; 
   
they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil 
 
divided; the lame take the prey. 
 
24  And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell 
 
therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. 
34 
The Lord’s Wrath upon the Nations 
1  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the 
   
earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that 
 
come forth of it. 
2  For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury 
upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath 
 
delivered them to the slaughter. 
3  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out 
of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their 
blood. 
4  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall 
be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as 
 
the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig 
tree.  
5  ¶ For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come 
 
down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. 
6  The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is made fat with 
fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the 
kidneys of rams: for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a 
 
great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
