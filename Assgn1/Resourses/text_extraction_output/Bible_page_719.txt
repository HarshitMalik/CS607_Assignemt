  720    2 Samuel 12 
16  David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and 
 
went in, and lay all night upon the earth. 
17  And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up 
from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with 
 
them. 
18  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the 
servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for 
 
they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, 
and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex 
 
himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? 
 
19  But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived 
that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is 
 
the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
 
20  Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed 
himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the 
Lord, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when 
   
he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 
21  Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast 
done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but 
   
when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 
22  And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I 
 
said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the 
child may live? 
 
23  But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back 
 
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. 
 
24  ¶ And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, 
and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name 
 
Solomon: and the Lord loved him. 
 
25  And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his 
 
name Jedidiah [beloved of the Lord], because of the Lord. 
David Captures Rabbah 
26  ¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and 
took the royal city.
