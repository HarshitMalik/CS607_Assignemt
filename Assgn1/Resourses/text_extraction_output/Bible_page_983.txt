  984    2 Chronicles 6 
23  then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by 
requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; 
 
and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his 
righteousness. 
24  ¶ And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, 
because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess 
 
thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this 
house; 
 
25  then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people 
Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to 
them and to their fathers. 
26  ¶ When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they 
have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and 
 
confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict 
them; 
 
27  then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, 
and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, 
wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which 
 
thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. 
28  ¶ If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be 
blasting or mildew, locusts or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege 
 
them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore, or whatsoever 
 
sickness there be: 
 
29  then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any 
man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his 
own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this 
house: 
 
30  then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and 
render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart 
thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of 
 
men;) 
 
31  that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in 
the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 
32  ¶ Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people 
Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and
