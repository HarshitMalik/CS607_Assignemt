  1570    Isaiah 44 
17  which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the 
power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are 
   
extinct, they are quenched as tow. 
18  Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of 
old. 
19  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not 
   
know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the 
 
desert. 
20  The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: 
 
because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to 
give drink to my people, my chosen. 
21  This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my 
 
praise. 
22  ¶ But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been 
 
weary of me, O Israel. 
23  Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; 
 
neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused 
thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. 
24  Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou 
filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to 
 
serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. 
25  ¶ I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own 
sake, and will not remember thy sins. 
26  Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that 
   
thou mayest be justified. 
27  Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed 
against me. 
28  Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have 
given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

The Lord the Only God 
1  Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
