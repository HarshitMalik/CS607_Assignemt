  1412    Proverbs 6 
and thy want as an armed man.  
12  A naughty person, a wicked man, 
walketh with a froward mouth. 
13  He winketh with his eyes, 
he speaketh with his feet, 
he teacheth with his fingers; 
 
14  frowardness is in his heart, 
he deviseth mischief continually; 
 
he soweth discord. 
15  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; 
 
suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 
16  These six things doth the Lord hate; 
 
yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 
 
17  a proud look, a lying tongue, 
and hands that shed innocent blood, 
18  a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, 
feet that be swift in running to mischief, 
19  a false witness that speaketh lies, 
and he that soweth discord among brethren. 
Warning against Adultery 
20  My son, keep thy fatherâ€™s commandment, 
and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
 
21  bind them continually upon thine heart, 
and tie them about thy neck. 
22  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; 
 
when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; 
 
and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 
23  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; 
   
and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 
 
24  to keep thee from the evil woman, 
from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
25  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; 
 
neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
