  1736    Jeremiah 52 
5  So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
6  And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the 
famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the 
people of the land. 
7  Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went 
forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the 
two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans 
 
were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the 
 
plain. 
8  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook 
Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered 
 
from him. 
9  Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of 
Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment 
 
upon him. 
10  And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: 
 
he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
11  Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon 
 
bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in 
prison till the day of his death.

was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came 
Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of 
Babylon, into Jerusalem, 
13  and burned the house of the Lord, and the king’s house; and all 
 
the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned 
he with fire: 
 
14  and all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the 
guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
15  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive 
certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that
