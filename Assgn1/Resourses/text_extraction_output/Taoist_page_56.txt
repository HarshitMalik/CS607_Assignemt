Self-examination  is  not  to  be  done  only  thrice—how
can a mistake be allowed twice?
Master Zhu said, “In the course of daily activities, when
you realize something is wrong, then do not act that way.
This is how to get rid of sicknesses.”
If you ask how to be able to “not act that way,” this is
riding a donkey in search of a donkey.
When students are practicing Pure Land Buddhism, this
involves  three  working  elements—verbal,  physical,  and
mental.
It is easier to be faultless verbally than physically, easier
to  be  faultless  physically  than  mentally.  People  with
determination  will  apply  effort  to  the  hard  part,  quickly
reforming in order to gain access to the Way.
It  is  sometimes  asked  whether  people  who  have  done
wrong  can  repent.  Whatever  you  have  done  in  the  past,
whether  major  or  minor,  cannot  be  grasped  when  you
search  for  it,  inside  or  outside—this  is  called  true
repentance.
It is also asked what people should do when they have
vows they fear to break. When you are confused, you talk
of promises; when enlightened, there are none at all.
Try to look for them right now—where are your vows?
In this way you can attain great liberation.
