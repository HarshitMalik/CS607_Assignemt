light  of  essence  inevitably  wavers.  If  the  attention  is  not
refined, then emotionalism does not die, so the root of life
is not firm. It is necessary to quench the fires in the mind
completely,  extinguishing  endless  desires.  At  all  times
keep  inward  watch  over  the  sole  reality;  in  all  places
realize myriad objectifications are empty. Then the sky of
your essential nature will be clear and cool and you will no
longer be carried away by joy or delight.
This is merely an effect of refining the self. Therefore it
is said, “Before you refine the restorative elixir, first refine
your  self.  When  you  have  thoroughly  refined  your  self,
then refine the elixir.”
RETURNING TO EMPTINESS AND HIBERNATING
IN THE CAVERN OF ENERGY
Master Shouyang said:
When you go into retreat to work on the path of return,
you  should  sit  straight  in  a  quiet  room  and  turn  your
awareness inward.
Congeal the spirit on the ground of the gateway of life,
aware  but  not  fixated,  conscious  of  it  at  first,  then
afterward forgetting it.
Empty  the  mind  and  solidify  the  spirit,  not  sticking  to
material form yet not falling into empty oblivion.
With  open  awareness  undimmed,  consciously  nurture
silent shining.
Do this for a period of three sticks of incense at a time.
