Not  killing,  not  stealing,  and  not  being  promiscuous
purify your action.
Not  lying,  not  embellishing  speech,  not  speaking
hypocritically,  and  not  speaking  viciously  purify  your
word.
Getting  rid  of  greed,  anger,  and  false  thought  purifies
your thought.
When  you  avoid  everything  improper  in  looking  and
listening,  in  speech,  and  in  action,  this  is  the
consummation  of  discipline.  Overcoming  hostility  and
desire is the origin of discipline.
Confucius  said  that  a  cultivated  person  has  three
disciplines.  He  meant  that  a  cultured  person  always
maintains  an  attitude  of  disciplined  caution,  never  acting
under the compulsion of blood energy.
Confucius  also  said  that  a  cultivated  person  has  nine
thoughts.  He  meant  that  a  cultivated  person’s  mind  is
always  alert,  spontaneously  disciplined  without  having  to
keep rules.
The Shurangama Sutra says, “Concentrating the mind is
discipline.  Stability  comes  from  discipline,  insight  comes
from stability.”
STABILITY
A  writing  on  the  nature  of  stability  says  that  stability
means  you  are  stable  even  when  active,  as  well  as  being
stable when quiet.
