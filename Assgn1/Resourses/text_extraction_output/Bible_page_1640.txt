  1641    Jeremiah 13 
look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross 
darkness. 
17  But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your 
pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, 
 
because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive. 
18  ¶ Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit 
down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of 
 
your glory. 
19  The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: 
 
Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly 
carried away captive. 
20  ¶ Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: 
 
where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? 
 
21  What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught 
 
them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take 
 
thee, as a woman in travail? 
 
22  And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon 
me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, 
 
and thy heels made bare. 
23  Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then 
 
may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. 
24  Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the 
wind of the wilderness. 
25  This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the 
Lord; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. 
 
26  Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame 
may appear. 
27  I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy 
whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe 
unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it 
   
once be?
