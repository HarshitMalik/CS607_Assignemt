  2142    Mark 14 
36  And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take 
 
away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what 
 
thou wilt. 
37  And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, 
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 
   
38  Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is 
ready, but the flesh is weak. 
39  And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. 
40  And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes 
were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. 
41  And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, 
and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son 
   
of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
42  Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. 
 
The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus 
43  Â¶ And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the 
twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, 
from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
44  And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, 
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him 
 
away safely. 
45  And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and 
saith, Master, Master; and kissed him. 
 
46  And they laid their hands on him, and took him. 
47  And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant 
of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
48  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as 
against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? 
 
49  I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: 
 
but the Scriptures must be fulfilled. 
50  And they all forsook him, and fled.
