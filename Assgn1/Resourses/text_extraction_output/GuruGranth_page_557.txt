In spite of all the decorations which you have made, O soul-bride, your Husband Lord is 
attuned to someone else. You don‟t have the bracelets of gold, nor the good crystal 
jewelry; you have not dealt with the true jeweller. Those arms, which do not embrace 
the neck of the Husband Lord, burn in anguish. All my companions have gone to enjoy 
their Husband Lord; which door should I, the wretched one, go to? O friend, I am very 
well-behaved, but I am not pleasing to my Husband Lord at all. I have woven my hair 
into lovely braids, and saturated their partings with vermillion; but when I go before 
Him,  I  am  not  accepted,  and  I  die,  suffering  in  sorrow.  I  weep  —  the  whole  world 
weeps; even the birds of the forest weep with me. The only thing which does not weep 
is my body‟s sense of separation, which has separated me from my Husband Lord. In a 
dream, He came, and went away again; I cried so many tears. I cannot come to You, O 
my Beloved, and I cannot send anyone to You. Come to me, O blessed sleep — perhaps 
I will see my Husband Lord again. One who brings me a message from my Lord and 
Master — says Nanak, what shall I give to Him? Cutting off my head, I give it to Him to 
sit upon; without my head, I shall still serve Him. Why haven‟t I died? Why hasn‟t my 
life just ended? My Husband Lord has become a stranger to me.  || 1 || 3 ||    
 
WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
When  the  mind  is  filthy,  everything  is  filthy;  by  washing  the  body,  the  mind  is  not 
cleansed. This world is deluded by doubt; hardly anyone understands this.  || 1 ||   O 
my mind, chant the One Name. The True Guru has given me this treasure.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   Even if one learns the Yogic postures of the Siddhas, and holds his sexual 
energy in check, still, the filth of the mind is not removed, and the filth of egotism is not 
eliminated.  || 2 ||   This mind is not controlled by any other discipline, except the 
Sanctuary  of  the  True  Guru.  Meeting  the  True  Guru,  one  is  transformed  beyond 
description.  || 3 ||   Prays Nanak, one who dies upon meeting the True Guru, shall be 
rejuvenated  through  the  Word  of  the  Guru‟s  Shabad.  The  filth  of  attachment  and 
possessiveness  shall  depart,  and  the  mind  shall  become  pure.    ||  4  ||  1  ||   
WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  By His Grace, one serves the True Guru; by His Grace, 
service is performed. By His grace, this mind comes under control; by His Grace, the 
mind becomes pure.  || 1 ||   O my mind, think of the True One. Think of the One, and 
you shall find peace; you shall never suffer in sorrow again.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   By His 
Grace, one dies while yet alive; by His Grace, the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in 
the  mind.  By  His  Grace,  one  understands  the  Hukam  of  God‟s  Command;  by  His 
Command,  one  merges  into  Him.    ||  2  ||      That  tongue,  which  does  not  savor  the 
sublime essence of the Lord — may that tongue be burned off! It remains attached to 
other pleasures, and through the love of duality, it suffers in pain.  || 3 ||   The One 
Lord grants His Grace to all; He Himself makes distinctions.
