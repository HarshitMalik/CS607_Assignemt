speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

Jesus Washes His Disciples’ Feet 
1  Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his 
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the 
Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved 
them unto the end. 
2  And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of 
Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him; 
 
3  Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, 
and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
 
4  he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a 
 
towel, and girded himself. 
5  After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the 
disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was 
girded. 
6  Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, 
 
dost thou wash my feet? 
 
7  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not 
now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
 
8  Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus 
answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
9  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my 
hands and my head. 
10  Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his 
feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
 
11  For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not 
 
all clean. 
12  ¶ So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, 
and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have 
done to you?
