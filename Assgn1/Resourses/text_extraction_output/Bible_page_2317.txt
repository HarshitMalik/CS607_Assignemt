  2318    Acts 5 
5 
Ananias and Sapphira 
1  But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a 
possession, 
2  and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and 
brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet. 
3  But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to 
the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? 
 
4  While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was 
 
it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in 
 
thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 
 
5  And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: 
 
and great fear came on all them that heard these things. 
6  And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and 
buried him. 
7  ¶ And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, 
not knowing what was done, came in. 
8  And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for 
so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 
 
9  Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to 
tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have 
 
buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. 
10  Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the 
ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, 
 
carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. 
11  And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as 
heard these things. 
Many Signs and Wonders Performed 
12  ¶ And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders 
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in 
 
Solomon’s porch.
