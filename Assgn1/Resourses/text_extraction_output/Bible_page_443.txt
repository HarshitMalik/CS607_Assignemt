  444    Deuteronomy 15 
The Law of the Tithe 
22  ¶ Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field 
bringeth forth year by year. 
23  And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he 
shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy 
wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy 
flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always. 
 
24  And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to 
carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the Lord thy 
 
God shall choose to set his name there, when the Lord thy God 
hath blessed thee: 
 
25  then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine 
hand, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall 
choose: 
 
26  and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth 
after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for 
whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the 
 
Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 
27  and the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him: 
   
for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee. 
28  ¶ At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of 
thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: 
 
29  and the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with 
thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which 
are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that 
 
the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand 
which thou doest.

The Year of Release 
1  At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
