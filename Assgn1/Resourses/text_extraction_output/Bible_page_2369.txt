  2370    Acts 22 
38  Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an 
uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that 
were murderers? 
 
39  But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, 
a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak 
 
unto the people. 
40  And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and 
beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was 
made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, 
saying, 
22 
1  Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense which I make now 
unto you. 
2  ¶ (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to 
them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,) 
 
3  ¶ I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, 
yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught 
according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was 
zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. 
4  And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering 
into prisons both men and women. 
5  As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of 
the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, 
 
and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound 
unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.  
Paul Tells of His Conversion 
6  ¶ And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come 
nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from 
heaven a great light round about me. 
7  And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, 
Saul, why persecutest thou me?
