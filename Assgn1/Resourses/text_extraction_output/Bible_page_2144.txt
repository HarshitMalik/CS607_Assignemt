  2145    Mark 15 
4  And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? 
 
behold how many things they witness against thee. 
5  But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled. 
 
Jesus Sentenced to Die 
6  ¶ Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, 
whomsoever they desired. 
7  And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that 
had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in 
the insurrection. 
8  And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had 
ever done unto them. 
9  But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you 
the King of the Jews? 
 
10  For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
11  But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather 
release Barabbas unto them. 
12  And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then 
that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
 
13  And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
14  Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And 
 
they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
15  And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto 
them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be 
crucified. 
16  ¶ And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Pretorium; 
 
and they call together the whole band. 
17  And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, 
and put it about his head, 
18  and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
 
19  And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon 
him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
