  856    2 Kings 9 
24  And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram 
between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk 
down in his chariot. 
25  Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the 
portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how 
 
that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the 
Lord laid this burden upon him; 
 
26  Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of 
his sons, saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith 
 
the Lord. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, 
according to the word of the Lord. 
Jehu Kills Ahaziah 
27  ¶ But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way 
of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite 
him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, 
which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. 
28  And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried 
him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 
29  ¶ And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah 
to reign over Judah. 
The Death of Jezebel 
30  ¶ And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she 
 
painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. 
31  And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who 
slew his master? 
 
32  And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my 
side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. 
   
33  And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some 
 
of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he 
 
trode her under foot.
