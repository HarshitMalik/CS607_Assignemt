  31    Genesis 14 
10  And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom 
 
and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to 
 
the mountain. 
11  And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their 
victuals, and went their way. 
12  And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, 
and his goods, and departed. 
13  ¶ And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the 
Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother 
 
of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with 
 
Abram. 
14  And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he 
armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred 
and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. 
15  And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, 
and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the 
left hand of Damascus. 
16  And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his 
brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. 
Melchizedek Blesses Abram 
17  ¶ And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return 
from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with 
him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale. 
18  And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and 
 
he was the priest of the most high God. 
19  And he blessed him, and said, 
Blessed be Abram of the most high God, 
possessor of heaven and earth: 
 
20  and blessed be the most high God, 
which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. 
And he gave him tithes of all.  
21  And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and 
take the goods to thyself.
