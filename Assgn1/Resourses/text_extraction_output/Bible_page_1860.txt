  1861    Ezekiel 46 
23  And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
Lord, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the 
seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering. 
 
24  And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and 
an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah. 
25  In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do 
the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, 
according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, 
and according to the oil. 
46 
1  Thus saith the Lord God; The gate of the inner court that looketh 
 
toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the 
 
sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall 
be opened. 
2  And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate 
without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests 
shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall 
worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the 
   
gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
3  Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this 
gate before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 
4  And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in 
the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram 
without blemish. 
5  And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat 
offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to 
an ephah. 
6  And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without 
blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. 
 
7  And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and 
an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall 
attain unto, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
