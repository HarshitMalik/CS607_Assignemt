  232    Leviticus 4 
12  ¶ And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the 
Lord. 
13  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the 
tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle 
 
the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 
14  And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire 
unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat 
 
that is upon the inwards, 
15  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the 
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he 
take away. 
16  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the 
 
offering made by fire for a sweet savor: all the fat is the Lord’s. 
 
17  It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all 
your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

Sin Offerings 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through 
ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord 
concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against 
any of them: 
 
3  if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the 
people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a 
 
young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering. 
4  And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of 
the congregation before the Lord; and shall lay his hand upon the 
 
bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the Lord. 
5  And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and 
bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
 
6  and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the 
blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
