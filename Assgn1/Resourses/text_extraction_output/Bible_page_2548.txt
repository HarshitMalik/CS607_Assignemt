  2549    Philemon 1 
12  whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine 
 
own bowels: 
 
13  whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might 
have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
 
14  but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should 
 
not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 
15  ¶ For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou 
shouldest receive him for ever; 
 
16  not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, 
specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, 
and in the Lord? 
 
17  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
18  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on mine 
account; 
 
19  I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I 
 
do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self 
besides. 
20  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels 
 
in the Lord. 
21  ¶ Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing 
that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
22  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your 
 
prayers I shall be given unto you.
