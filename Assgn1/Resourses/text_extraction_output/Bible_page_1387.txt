  1388    Psalms 139 
139 
God’s Omnipresence and Omniscience 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. 
2  Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; 
 
thou understandest my thought afar off. 
3  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, 
and art acquainted with all my ways. 
4  For there is not a word in my tongue, 
but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. 
5  Thou hast beset me behind and before, 
and laid thine hand upon me. 
6  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; 
 
it is high, I cannot attain unto it. 
7  Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? 
 
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
 
8  If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: 
 
if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 
9  If I take the wings of the morning, 
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 
 
10  even there shall thy hand lead me, 
and thy right hand shall hold me. 
11  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; 
 
even the night shall be light about me. 
12  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; 
 
but the night shineth as the day: 
 
the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 
13  For thou hast possessed my reins: 
 
thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb. 
14  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: 
   
marvelous are thy works;
