divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the 
 
same mind and in the same judgment. 
11  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them 
which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among 
you. 
12  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of 
 
Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
   
13  Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in 
   
the name of Paul? 
 
14  I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;  
 
15  lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
16  And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know 
 
not whether I baptized any other. 
17  For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not 
 
with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of 
none effect. 
Christ the Power and Wisdom of God 
18  Â¶ For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; 
 
but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. 
19  For it is written, 
I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, 
and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.  
20  Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this 
   
world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  
   
21  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not 
God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them 
that believe. 
22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
 
23  but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and 
unto the Greeks foolishness; 
 
24  but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the 
power of God, and the wisdom of God.
