  1316    Psalms 86 
5  Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? 
 
Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 
 
6  Wilt thou not revive us again: 
 
that thy people may rejoice in thee? 
 
7  Show us thy mercy, O Lord, 
and grant us thy salvation. 
8  I will hear what God the Lord will speak: 
 
for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: 
 
but let them not turn again to folly. 
9  Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; 
 
that glory may dwell in our land. 
10  Mercy and truth are met together; 
 
righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
11  Truth shall spring out of the earth; 
 
and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 
12  Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; 
 
and our land shall yield her increase. 
13  Righteousness shall go before him; 
 
and shall set us in the way of his steps.

3  Be merciful unto me, O Lord: 
 
for I cry unto thee daily. 
4  Rejoice the soul of thy servant: 
 
for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
5  For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive;
