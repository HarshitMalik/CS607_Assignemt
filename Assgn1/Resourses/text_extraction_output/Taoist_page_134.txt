remains in the aperture of nonvolatile energy, consciously
visualizing  the  energy  of  exhalation  and  inhalation  rise
along the active channel up the spine, like a red sun rising
up  to  the  top  of  the  sky  in  the  crown  of  the  head,  then
descend  along  the  passive  channel,  like  a  white  moon,
down to the furnace of the earth in the belly.
Count  your  breaths  this  way  to  ten  by  ones,  then  to  a
hundred  by  tens,  then  to  a  thousand,  to  ten  thousand,

From  mindfulness  you  turn  mindless.”  If  you  make  the
mind  empty  and  open,  nonresistant  and  receptive,  then  it
has no birth or death.
If  you  want  to  get  rid  of  random  thoughts,  first  keep

in having no dreams. When you have no dreams, then “the
mind dies and the spirit lives.”
This is very important in the here and now. After all, if
the mind is not refined, then the spirit is not stable, so the
