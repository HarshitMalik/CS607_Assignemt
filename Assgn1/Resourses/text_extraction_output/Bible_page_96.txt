  97    Genesis 41 
13  yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore 
thee unto thy place; and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his 
 
hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 
14  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show 
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto 
Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
 
15  for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and 
 
here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the 
dungeon. 
16  ¶ When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he 
said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three 
white baskets on my head: 
 
17  and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats 
for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my 
 
head. 
18  And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: 
 
The three baskets are three days: 
 
19  yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, 
and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from 
 
off thee. 
20  ¶ And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, 
that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head 
 
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
21  And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he 
 
gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 
 
22  but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
 
23  Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

1  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh 
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
