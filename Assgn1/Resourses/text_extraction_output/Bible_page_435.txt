  436    Deuteronomy 11 
11  but the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and 
valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 
 
12  a land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord 
 
thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even 
unto the end of the year. 
13  ¶ And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my 
commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord 
your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your 
soul, 
14  that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first 
rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and 
thy wine, and thine oil. 
15  And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest 
eat and be full. 
16  Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye 
turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
 
17  and then the Lord’s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up 
the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her 
fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the 
 
Lord giveth you.  
18  ¶ Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in 
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may 
be as frontlets between your eyes. 
19  And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when 
thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, 
when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
20  And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house, and 
upon thy gates:  
 
21  that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in 
the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as 
the days of heaven upon the earth. 
22  For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I 
command you, to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in 
all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
