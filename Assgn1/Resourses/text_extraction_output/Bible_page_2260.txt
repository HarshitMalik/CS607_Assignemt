  2261    John 7 
61  When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he 
said unto them, Doth this offend you? 
 
62  What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was 
before? 
 
63  It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the 
   
words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. 
64  But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the 
beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray 
him. 
65  And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto 
me, except it were given unto him of my Father. 
66  ¶ From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no 
more with him. 
67  Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 
 
68  Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou 
 
hast the words of eternal life. 
69  And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the 
living God.  
70  Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you 
is a devil? 
 
71  He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should 
 
betray him, being one of the twelve.

The Unbelief of Jesus’ Brethren 
1  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in 
 
Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
2  Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
3  His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into 
Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 
4  For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself 
seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, show thyself 
to the world.
