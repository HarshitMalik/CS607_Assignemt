  1072    Ezra 9 
33  Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels 
weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son 
of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; 
   
and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son 
of Binnui, Levites; 
 
34  by number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was 
 
written at that time. 
35  ¶ Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were 
come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of 
Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy 
and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a 
 
burnt offering unto the Lord. 
36  And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s 
lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they 
 
furthered the people, and the house of God.

Ezra’s Prayer of Confession 
1  Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, 
The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not 
separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according 
to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the 
Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the 
Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
2  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their 
sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the 
 
people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath 
 
been chief in this trespass. 
3  And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, 
and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down 
astonished. 
4  Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the 
words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those
