GITA MAHATMYA
21. He who fails to read this “Glory of the Gita” after having read the Gita, loses the benefit
thereby, and the effort alone remains.
COMMENTARY: This is to test and confirm the faith of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita,
which is not a mere philosophical book but the word of God and should therefore be studied with
great faith and devotion. The Gita Mahatmya generates this devotion in one’s heart.
Etanmaahaatmyasamyuktam geetaabhyaasam karoti yah;
Sa tatphalamavaapnoti durlabhaam gatim aapnuyaat.
22. One who studies the Gita, together with this “Glory of the Gita”, attains the fruits
mentioned above, and reaches the state which is otherwise very difficult to be attained.
Suta Uvaacha:
Maahaatmyam etad geetaayaah mayaa proktam sanaatanam;
Geetaante cha pathedyastu yaduktam tatphalam labhet.
Suta said:
23. This greatness or “Glory of the Gita”, which is eternal, as narrated by me, should be read
at the end of the study of the Gita, and the fruits mentioned therein will be obtained.
Iti srivaraahapuraane srigeetaamaahaatmyam sampoornam.
Thus ends the “Glory of the Gita” contained in the Varaha Purana.
Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti!
