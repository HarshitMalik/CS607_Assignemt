  1495    Isaiah 2 
23  thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one 
 
loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the 
 
fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
24  ¶ Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of 
Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of 
mine enemies. 
25  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy

26  and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at

righteousness, the faithful city. 
27  ¶ Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with 
righteousness. 
28  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be 
together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed. 
29  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye 
shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
30  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that 
hath no water. 
31  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and 
they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and 
shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. 
 
3  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he 
 
will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of
