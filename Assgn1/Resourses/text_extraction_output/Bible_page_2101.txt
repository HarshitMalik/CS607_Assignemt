  2102    Mark 3 
The Disciples Pluck Grain on the Sabbath 
23  Â¶ And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the 
sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears 
 
of corn.  
24  And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the 
sabbath day that which is not lawful? 
 
25  And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when 
he had need, and was ahungered, he, and they that were with him? 
 
26  How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the 
high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat 
but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 
 
27  And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not 
man for the sabbath: 
 
28  therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. 
3 
The Man with a Withered Hand 
1  And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man 
 
there which had a withered hand. 
2  And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath 
day; that they might accuse him. 
 
3  And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand 
forth. 
4  And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, 
or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace. 
   
5  And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being 
grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, 
Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was 
 
restored whole as the other. 
6  And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with 
the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
