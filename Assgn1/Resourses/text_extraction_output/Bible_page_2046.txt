  2047    Matthew 13 
Jesus’ Use of Parables 
34  ¶ All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and 
 
without a parable spake he not unto them: 
 
35  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, 
I will open my mouth in parables; 
 
I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation 
of the world.  
Jesus Explains the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares 
36  ¶ Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and 
 
his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of 
the tares of the field. 
37  He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is 
the Son of man; 
 
38  the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
 
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 
   
39  the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of 
 
the world; and the reapers are the angels. 
 
40  As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it 
 
be in the end of this world. 
41  The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather 
out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do 
iniquity; 
 
42  and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and 
 
gnashing of teeth. 
43  Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of 
their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
The Hidden Treasure 
44  ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; 
 
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof 
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
