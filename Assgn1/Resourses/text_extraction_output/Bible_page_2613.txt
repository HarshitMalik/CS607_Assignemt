  2614    Jude 1 
21  keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our 
Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
22  And of some have compassion, making a difference: 
 
23  and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even 
 
the garment spotted by the flesh. 
Concluding Doxology 
24  Â¶ Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to 
present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding 
joy, 
25  to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion 
and power, both now and ever. Amen.
