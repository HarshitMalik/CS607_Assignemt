  80    Genesis 33 
33 
Jacob and Esau Reconciled 
1  And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, 
and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto 
Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
2  And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah 
and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
3  And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground 
seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
4  ¶ And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his 
neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
 
5  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and 
said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which 
 
God hath graciously given thy servant. 
6  Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and 
they bowed themselves. 
7  And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: 
 
and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed 
themselves. 
8  And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And 
 
he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
9  And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast 
 
unto thyself. 
10  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy 
sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen 
 
thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast 
pleased with me. 
11  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God 
 
hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he 
urged him, and he took it. 
12  ¶ And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go 
before thee.
