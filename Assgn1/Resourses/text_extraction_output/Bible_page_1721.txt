The Prophecy concerning the Ammonites 
1  Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the Lord; Hath Israel no 
 
sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and 
   
his people dwell in his cities? 
 
2  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will cause 
an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it 
 
shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with 
fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith 
 
the Lord. 
3  ¶ Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, 
 
gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; 
   
for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes 
together. 
4  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O 
backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who 
 
shall come unto me? 
 
5  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, 
from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every 
 
man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. 
 
6  And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of 
Ammon, saith the Lord. 
The Prophecy concerning Edom 
7  ¶ Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord of hosts; Is wisdom no 
 
more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their 
   
wisdom vanished? 
 
8  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will 
 
bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. 
9  If grape gatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning 
grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
