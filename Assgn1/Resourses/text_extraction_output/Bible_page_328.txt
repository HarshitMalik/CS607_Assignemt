The Observance of the Passover 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land 
of Egypt, saying, 
2  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed 
season. 
3  In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his 
appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to 
 
all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. 
4  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep 
the passover. 
5  And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first 
month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the 
 
Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.  
6  And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of 
a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they 
 
came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. 
7  And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a 
man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering 
 
of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 
 
8  And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the 
Lord will command concerning you. 
9  Â¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
10  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of 
your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a 
journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord. 
11  The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, 
and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
12  They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone 
of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep 
 
it.
