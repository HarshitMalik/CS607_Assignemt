  1507    Isaiah 9 
13  Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let 
 
him be your dread. 
14  And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for 
 
a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a 
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
15  And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and 
be snared, and be taken. 
16  Â¶ Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
17  And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house 
of Jacob, and I will look for him.  
18  Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for 
signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which 
dwelleth in mount Zion. 
19  And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have 
familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should 
 
not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 
   
20  To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this 
 
word, it is because there is no light in them. 
21  And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it 
 
shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret 
themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. 
22  And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and 
 
darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

The Birth and Reign of the Prince of Peace 
1  Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, 
when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the 
land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by 
the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.  
2  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they 
 
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the 
light shined.
