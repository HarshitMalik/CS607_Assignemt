  1177    Job 30 
they have also let loose the bridle before me. 
12  Upon my right hand rise the youth; 
 
they push away my feet, 
and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
13  They mar my path, 
they set forward my calamity, 
they have no helper. 
14  They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: 
 
in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. 
15  Terrors are turned upon me: 
 
they pursue my soul as the wind: 
 
and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 
16  And now my soul is poured out upon me; 
 
the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 
17  My bones are pierced in me in the night season: 
 
and my sinews take no rest. 
18  By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: 
 
it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
19  He hath cast me into the mire, 
and I am become like dust and ashes. 
20  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: 
 
I stand up, and thou regardest me not. 
21  Thou art become cruel to me: 
 
with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 
22  Thou liftest me up to the wind; 
 
thou causest me to ride upon it, 
and dissolvest my substance. 
23  For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, 
and to the house appointed for all living. 
24  Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, 
though they cry in his destruction. 
25  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? 
 
Was not my soul grieved for the poor? 
 
26  When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: 
 
and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
