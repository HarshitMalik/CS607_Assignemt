empty,  you  are  clear;  when  clear,  you  are  penetrating.
When  action  is  straightforward  it  is  objective  and  fair;
when objective and fair, it is universal. This is to be hoped
for.”
Learning  the  Way  is  learning  sagehood.  The  Way  is
inherent in us and does not come from outside; sagehood
cannot be attained without virtue. Our human nature is the
same as that of sages; if we can perfect that nature, we will
be sages.
People  who  study  for  exams  can  pass  them—everyone
knows this. Why doesn’t everyone know that people who
study  sagehood  can  become  sages?  Confucius  studied
tirelessly precisely because he believed he could become a
sage himself, and he taught untiringly because he saw that
everyone  in  the  world  can  become  a  sage.  He  traveled
throughout the nation-states of his time because he wanted
to  civilize  the  world  with  the  Way  of  sages;  he  produced
editions  of  the  six  classics  because  he  wanted  to  educate
later generations in the Way of sages.
What Confucians call sages, Taoists and Buddhists call
wizards  and  buddhas.  Buddha  means  awakened;  wizards
are  immortalists.  These  are  standard  definitions,  but  I
think  there  is  another  explanation  for  the  word  buddha.
The  Chinese  character  for  buddha  is  composed  of
“human” and “not.” This has the meaning of not acting on
human desires. If you are human yet can do what humans
do not, then you can become a buddha.
