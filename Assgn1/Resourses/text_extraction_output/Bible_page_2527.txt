The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to 
Timothy 
[1 Timothy] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our 
Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; 
 
2  ¶ Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: 
 
¶ Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father, and Jesus Christ 
our Lord. 
Warning against False Doctrine 
3  ¶ As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into 
Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no 
other doctrine, 
4  neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister 
questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. 
 
5  Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, 
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: 
 
6  from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain 
jangling; 
 
7  desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they 
 
say, nor whereof they affirm. 
8  ¶ But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 
 
9  knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for 
the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for 
unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of 
mothers, for manslayers, 
10  for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, 
for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any 
other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
