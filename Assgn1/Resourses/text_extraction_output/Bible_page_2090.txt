  2091    Matthew 27 
19  When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto 
him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I 
 
have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
20  But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they 
should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
21  The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain 
will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 
 
22  Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is 
called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. 
 
23  And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they 
 
cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 
24  ¶ When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a 
tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the 
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: 
 
see ye to it. 
25  Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on 
our children. 
26  Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged 
 
Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. 
27  ¶ Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common 
hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. 
28  And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
29  And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his 
head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before 
 
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
 
30  And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the 
head. 
31  And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from 
him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify 
him. 
The Crucifixion 
32  ¶ And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by 
name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
