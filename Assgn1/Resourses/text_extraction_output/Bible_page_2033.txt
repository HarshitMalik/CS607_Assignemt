  2034    Matthew 10 
33  And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the 
 
multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. 
34  But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of 
the devils.  
The Harvest Is Plenteous 
35  Â¶ And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their 
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing 
every sickness and every disease among the people.  
36  But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion 
on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep 
having no shepherd.  
37  Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but 
the laborers are few; 
 
38  pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth 
laborers into his harvest.

Jesus Chooses the Twelve 
1  And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them 
power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all 
manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 
2  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, 
 
who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of 
 
Zebedee, and John his brother; 
 
3  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; 
   
James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was 
Thaddeus; 
 
4  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
