When it comes to whetting a sword, no one would lick
it with his own tongue or try it on his body—why is that?
The ability of true knowledge to wound people is such that
if those who shun evil had this attitude there would be no
worry that true knowledge would not be purified.
The  human  mind  is  originally  luminous,  but  it  is
covered by desires for things, so it becomes desire. If you
know this phenomenon is the veil of desires for things, this
is  a  point  of  enlightenment;  focus  your  energy  on  it  and
stabilize it.
Today you get rid of a little, tomorrow you get rid of a
little. Suddenly they arise, suddenly they vanish—are you
aware of this?
If you can be aware of this and can watch, then you can
be neither aroused nor oblivious.
When you reach the point where you are neither aroused
nor  oblivious,  your  mind  is  stable  and  your  nature  is
complete.
Now your breath is going out and in; are you aware of
it?
If you can be aware of it and can stay with it, you can
thereby not deliberately exhale or inhale.
When you arrive at the point of not exhaling or inhaling,
then energy is whole and life is established.
