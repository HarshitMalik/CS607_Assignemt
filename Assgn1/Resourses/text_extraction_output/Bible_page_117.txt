  118    Genesis 48 
6  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and 
shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 
7  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the 
land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to 
come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; 
   
the same is Bethlehem. 
8  ¶ And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these? 
 
9  And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath 
given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto 
me, and I will bless them. 
10  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. 
And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and 
 
embraced them. 
11  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, 
 
lo, God hath showed me also thy seed. 
12  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he 
bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
13  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward 
Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s 
right hand, and brought them near unto him. 
14  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s 
head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s 
head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
 
15  And he blessed Joseph, and said, 
God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, 
the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, 
16  the angel which redeemed me from all evil, 
bless the lads; 
 
and let my name be named on them, 
and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; 
 
and let them grow into a multitude 
in the midst of the earth. 
17  ¶ And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the 
head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s 
 
hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
