  2637    Revelation 14 
3  and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before 
the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song 
 
but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were 
redeemed from the earth. 
4  These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are 
 
virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he 
goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits 
unto God and to the Lamb. 
5  And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault 
 
before the throne of God. 
The Messages of the Three Angels 
6  ¶ And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and 
to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 
7  saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the 
 
hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, 
 
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 
8  ¶ And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is 
fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the 
wine of the wrath of her fornication. 
9  ¶ And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If 
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in 
his forehead, or in his hand, 
10  the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is 
poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he 
 
shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the 
holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
 
11  and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and 
 
they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his 
image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 
12  ¶ Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
 
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
