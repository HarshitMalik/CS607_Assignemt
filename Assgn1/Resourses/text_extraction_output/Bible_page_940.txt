  941    1 Chronicles 16 
28  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with 
shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and 
with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 
29  ¶ And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came 
to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at 
a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised 
 
him in her heart. 
16 
1  So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent 
that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and 
 
peace offerings before God. 
2  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings 
and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
Lord. 
3  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every 
one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. 
4  ¶ And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark 
of the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God 
of Israel: 
 
5  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and 
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, 
and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but 
   
Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
 
6  Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually 
before the ark of the covenant of God. 
David’s Psalm of Thanksgiving 
7  ¶ Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the 
Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
8  Give thanks unto the Lord, 
call upon his name, 
make known his deeds among the people.
