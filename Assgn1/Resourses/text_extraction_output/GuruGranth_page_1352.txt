Death has arrived; now where will you run?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You believed that this 
body was permanent, but it shall turn to dust. Why don‟t you chant the Name of the 
Lord, you shameless fool?  || 1 ||   Let devotional worship of the Lord enter into your 
heart, and abandon the intellectualism of your mind. O Servant Nanak, this is the way 
to live in the world.  || 2 || 4 ||

SHALOK SEHSKRITEE, FIRST MEHL:   
You study the scriptures, say your prayers and argue; you worship stones and sit like a 
crane,  pretending  to  meditate.  You  speak  lies  and  well-ornamented  falsehood,  and 
recite  your  daily  prayers  three  times  a  day.  The  mala  is  around your  neck, and the 
sacred tilak mark is on your forehead. You wear two loin cloths, and keep your head 
covered. If you know God and the nature of karma, you know that all these rituals and 
beliefs are useless. Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord with faith. Without the True Guru, 
no one finds the Way.  || 1 ||   The mortal‟s life is fruitless, as long as he does not 
know God. Only a few, by Guru‟s Grace, cross over the world-ocean. The Creator, the 
Cause  of  causes,  is  All-powerful.  Thus  speaks  Nanak,  after  deep  deliberation.  The 
Creation is under the control of the Creator. By His Power, He sustains and supports it.  
|| 2 ||   The Shabad is Yoga, the Shabad is spiritual wisdom; the Shabad is the Vedas 
for  the  Brahmin.  The  Shabad  is  heroic  bravery  for  the  Khshaatriya;  the  Shabad  is 
service to others for the Soodra. The Shabad for all is the Shabad, the Word of the One 
God, for one who knows this secret. Nanak is the slave of the Divine, Immaculate Lord.  
|| 3 ||   The One Lord is the Divinity of all divinities. He is the Divinity of the soul. 
Nanak is the slave of that one who knows the Secrets of the soul and the Supreme Lord 
God. He is the Divine Immaculate Lord Himself.  || 4 ||

Who is the mother, and who is the father? Who is the son, and what is the pleasure of 
marriage?  Who  is  the  brother,  friend,  companion  and  relative?  Who  is  emotionally 
attached to the family? Who is restlessly attached to beauty? It leaves, as soon as we 
see it. Only the meditative remembrance of God remains with us.
