  1657    Jeremiah 22 
he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare 
 
them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. 
8  ¶ And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; 
 
Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. 
9  He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the 
famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to 
 
the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be 
unto him for a prey. 
10  For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, 
saith the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of 
 
Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. 
11  ¶ And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the 
word of the Lord; 
 
12  O house of David, thus saith the Lord; Execute judgment in the 
 
morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the 
oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can 
quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
13  Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of 
the plain, saith the Lord; which say, Who shall come down against 
 
us? or who shall enter into our habitations? 
   
14  But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the 
Lord: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall 
 
devour all things round about it.

and speak there this word, 
2  and say, Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, that sittest 
upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people 
that enter in by these gates: 
 
3  thus saith the Lord; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and 
 
deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no
