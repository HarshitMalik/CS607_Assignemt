  2607    1 John 5 
15  and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that 
we have the petitions that we desired of him. 
16  If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall 
ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. 
There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 
 
17  All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 
 
18  ¶ We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that 
 
is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth 
him not. 
19  ¶ And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in 
wickedness. 
20  ¶ And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an 
understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in 
 
him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, 
and eternal life. 
21  Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
