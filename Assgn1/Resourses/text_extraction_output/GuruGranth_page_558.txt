O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, the fruits are obtained, and one is blessed with the 
Glorious Greatness of the Naam.  || 4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  Emotional 
attachment to Maya is darkness; without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom. Those 
who are attached to the Word of the Shabad understand; those in duality are ruined.  || 
1 ||   O my mind, under Guru‟s Instruction, do good deeds. Dwell forever and ever 
upon the Lord God, and you shall find the gate of galvation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He 
alone is the treasure of virtue; He Himself gives, and then one receives. Without the 
Name, all are separated from Him; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one meets 
Him.  || 2 ||   Acting in selfishness and egotism they lose, and nothing comes into their 
hands.  But  meeting  with  the  True  Guru,  they  find  Truth,  and  merge  into  the  True 
Name.  || 3 ||   Hope and desire abide in this body, but the Lord‟s Light shines within as 
well.  O  Nanak,  the  self-willed  manmukhs  are  in  bondage,  while  the  Gurmukhs  are 
liberated.  || 4 || 3 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  The faces of the happy soul-brides 
are radiant forever; through the Guru, they are peacefully poised. They constantly enjoy 
their Husband Lord, eradicating self-conceit from within.  || 1 ||   O my mind, meditate 
on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The True Guru has given me this understanding of 
the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The abandoned brides cry out in suffering; they do not 
attain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. In the love of duality, they look ugly; they 
suffer in pain as they go beyond.  || 2 ||   The virtuous soul-bride constantly chants the 
Glorious Praises of the Lord; she enshrines the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within her 
heart. The unvirtuous woman suffers and cries out in pain.  || 3 ||   The One Lord and 
Master  is  the  Husband  Lord  of  all;  He  cannot  be  described  at  all.  O  Nanak, He has 
separated some from Himself, while others are committed to His Name.  || 4 || 4 ||   
WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam always seems sweet; 
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I come to taste it. Through the True Word of 
the Guru‟s Bani, I am absorbed in peace and poise; the Dear Lord is enshrined in the 
mind.    ||  1  ||      The  Lord,  granting  His  Grace,  has  led  me  to  meet  the  True  Guru. 
Through the Perfect True Guru, I meditate on the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   
Through Brahma, the hymns of the Vedas were revealed, but the love of Maya spread. 
The wise one, Shiva, pervades his own home, but he is engrossed in dark passions and 
excessive egotism.  || 2 ||   Vishnu is always busy reincarnating himself, but who will 
save the world? The Gurmukhs are imbued with spiritual wisdom in this age; they are 
rid of the darkness of emotional attachment.  || 3 ||   Serving the True Guru, one is 
saved;  the  Gurmukh  crosses  over  the  world-ocean.  The  detached  renunciates  are 
attuned to the True Name; they attain the gate of salvation.  || 4 ||   The True One is 
pervading everywhere, deep within; He cherishes all. O Nanak, except for the One, I do 
not know any other; He is the Merciful Master of all.  || 5 || 5 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD 
MEHL:  The Gurmukh practices true self-discipline, and attains the essence of wisdom. 
The Gurmukh focuses his meditation on the True One.  || 1 ||
