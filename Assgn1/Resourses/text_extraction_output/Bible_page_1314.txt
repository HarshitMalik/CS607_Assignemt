  1315    Psalms 85 
5  Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; 
 
in whose heart are the ways of them. 
6  Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; 
 
the rain also filleth the pools. 
7  They go from strength to strength, 
every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 
8  O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: 
 
give ear, O God of Jacob. 
Selah. 
9  Behold, O God our shield, 
and look upon the face of thine anointed. 
10  For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. 
I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, 
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11  For the Lord God is a sun and shield: 
 
the Lord will give grace and glory: 
 
no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
12  O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

A Prayer for Godâ€™s Mercy on Israel 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
1  Lord, thou hast been favorable unto thy land: 
 
thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
2  Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; 
 
thou hast covered all their sin. 
Selah. 
3  Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: 
 
thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 
4  Turn us, O God of our salvation, 
and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
