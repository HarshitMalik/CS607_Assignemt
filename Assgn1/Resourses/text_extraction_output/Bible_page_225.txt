  226    Exodus 40 
24  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over 
against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
25  And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses. 
26  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before 
the veil: 
 
27  and he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses. 
28  And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. 
29  And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle 
of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt 
offering and the meat offering; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
30  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the 
altar, and put water there, to wash withal. 
31  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their 
feet thereat: 
 
32  when they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they 
came near unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses. 
33  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the 
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished 
the work. 
The Cloud over the Tabernacle 
34  Â¶ Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory 
of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 
35  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, 
because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled 
the tabernacle. 
36  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the 
children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
 
37  but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the 
day that it was taken up.
