  1071    Ezra 8 
21  ¶ Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we 
might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way 
for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 
22  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and 
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had 
 
spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them 
for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all 
 
them that forsake him. 
23  So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of 
 
us. 
24  ¶ Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, 
Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
25  and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, 
even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his 
counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: 
 
26  I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of 
silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred 
talents; 
 
27  also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of 
 
fine copper, precious as gold. 
28  And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the Lord; the vessels are 
 
holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto 
 
the Lord God of your fathers. 
29  Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the 
priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at 
Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord. 
30  So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the 
gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of 
our God. 
31  ¶ Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of 
the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was 
 
upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of 
such as lay in wait by the way. 
32  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
