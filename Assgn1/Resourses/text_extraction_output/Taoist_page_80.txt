Seeing means looking inwardly; independently refers to
independence  of  mind.  If  you  look  inwardly  for  a  long
time,  not  only  will  your  mind  be  present,  your  mind  will
ultimately stabilize.
Spirit  and  energy  united  and  stabilized,  in  ecstasy  you
first  awaken.  The  heaven  and  earth  of  reality  commune,
with subtleties beyond the power of words to express.
The  Mind  Scripture  says,  “I  have  seen  the  mind  and
attained  the  Way  for  infinite  eons.”  Now  when  the  sun
sets,  who  knows  where  the  darkness  in  the  room  comes
from? Then when we light a lamp, who knows where the
darkness goes?
We  must  realize  the  lamp  has  no  reason  to  chase  the
darkness,  and  the  darkness  has  no  feeling  of  fear  of  the
lamp. There is no effort expended on either side.
The lamp can represent awakened awareness, while the
darkness  can  represent  ignorance.  Look  upon  past
phenomena as dreamlike, present phenomena as lightning-
swift, and future phenomena as completely obscure.
Also look upon all contrived phenomena in the world as
changing from moment to moment, troublesome no end, to
be put at a distance as soon as possible.
Whatever  you  may  be  doing,  you  should  practice  both
stopping and seeing. Stopping is silent calm; seeing is alert
awakeness.
Some ask what the clear mind is. The empty mind is the
clear mind. This clear mind has no images of self, person,
being, or liver of life; all things are empty.
