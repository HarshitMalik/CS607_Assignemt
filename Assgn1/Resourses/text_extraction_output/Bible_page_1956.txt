  1957    Micah 5 
12  But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand 
they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the 
 
floor. 
13  Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn 
 
iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces 
 
many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and 
 
their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. 
5 
The Rule of the Deliverer from Bethlehem 
1  Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid 
 
siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon 
 
the cheek. 
2  ¶ But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the 
thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that 
is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, 
 
from everlasting. 
3  Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which 
travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren 
 
shall return unto the children of Israel. 
4  And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the 
majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide: for 
   
now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. 
5  ¶ And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come 
into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we 
 
raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 
6  And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the 
land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us 
 
from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he 
treadeth within our borders. 
7  ¶ And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as 
a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth 
not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
