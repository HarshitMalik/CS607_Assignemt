  2328    Acts 8 
12  But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the 
kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, 
both men and women. 
13  Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he 
 
continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and 
signs which were done. 
14  ¶ Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that 
Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter 
and John: 
 
15  who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they 
might receive the Holy Ghost: 
 
16  (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were 
 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
17  Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy 
Ghost. 
18  And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands 
the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
19  saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, 
he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
20  But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou 
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
21  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not 
 
right in the sight of God.  
22  Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps 
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
23  For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond 
of iniquity. 
24  Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that 
none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
25  ¶ And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the 
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many 
villages of the Samaritans.
