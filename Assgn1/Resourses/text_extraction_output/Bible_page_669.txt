  670    1 Samuel 21 
three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with 
 
another, until David exceeded. 
42  And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have 
sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be 
between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. 
And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

David Flees from Saul 
1  Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech 
 
was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art 
thou alone, and no man with thee? 
 
2  And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath 
commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man 
know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I 
have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such 
 
and such a place. 
3  Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of 
 
bread in mine hand, or what there is present. 
4  And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread 
under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men 
 
have kept themselves at least from women. 
5  And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth 
women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came 
out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a 
manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the 
vessel. 
6  So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there 
 
but the showbread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put 
hot bread in the day when it was taken away. 
7  Â¶ Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, 
detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, 
 
the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
