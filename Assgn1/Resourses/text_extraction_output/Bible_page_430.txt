  431    Deuteronomy 9 
8  Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord 
was angry with you to have destroyed you. 
9  When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, 
even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, 
then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I neither did 
 
eat bread nor drink water: 
 
10  and the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with 
the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the 
 
words which the Lord spake with you in the mount, out of the 
midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly. 
11  And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that 
the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the 
covenant. 
12  And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from 
hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt 
 
have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the 
 
way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten 
 
image. 
13  Â¶ Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this 
people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
 
14  let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name 
from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and 
 
greater than they. 
15  So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount 
burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two 
 
hands. 
16  And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your 
God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly 
 
out of the way which the Lord had commanded you. 
17  And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and 
brake them before your eyes. 
18  And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and 
forty nights: I did neither eat bread nor drink water, because of all 
 
your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the 
Lord, to provoke him to anger.
