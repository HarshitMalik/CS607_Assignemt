This  is  how  the  Gurmukhs  eliminate  their  self-conceit,  and  come  to  rule  the  whole 
world. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.  
|| 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Blessed and approved is the coming into the world, of those 
Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, they save their 
families, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Guru 
unites  His  Sikhs,  the  Gurmukhs,  with  the  Lord.  The  Guru  keeps  some  of  them  with 
Himself, and engages others in His Service. Those who cherish their Beloved in their 
conscious  minds,  the  Guru  blesses  them  with  His  Love.  The  Guru  loves  all  of  His 
Gursikhs equally well, like friends, children and siblings. So chant the Name of the Guru, 
the  True  Guru,  everyone!  Chanting  the  Name  of  the  Guru,  Guru,  you  shall  be 
rejuvenated.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, the blind, ignorant fools do 
not  remember  the  Naam,  the  Name  of  the  Lord;  they  involve  themselves  in  other 
activities. They are bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death; they are 
punished, and in the end, they rot away in manure.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, 
those humble beings are true and approved, who serve their True Guru. They remain 
absorbed  in  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  and  their  comings  and  goings  cease.    ||  2  ||   
PAUREE:    Gathering  the  wealth  and  property  of  Maya,  brings  only  pain  in  the  end. 
Homes, mansions and adorned palaces will not go with anyone. He may breed horses of 
various  colors,  but  these  will  not  be  of  any  use  to  him.  O  human,  link  your 
consciousness  to  the  Lord‟s  Name,  and  in  the  end,  it  shall  be  your  companion  and 
helper. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh is 
blessed with peace.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Without the karma of good 
actions, the Name is not obtained; it can be obtained only by perfect good karma. O 
Nanak,  if  the  Lord  casts  His  Glance  of  Grace,  then  under  Guru‟s  Instruction,  one  is 
united in His Union.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  Some are cremated, and some are buried; 
some  are eaten  by dogs. Some  are thrown  into water, while others are thrown into 
wells. O  Nanak, it is not known, where they  go and into what they  merge.  || 2 ||   
PAUREE:    The  food  and  clothes,  and  all  the  worldly  possessions  of  those  who  are 
attuned  to  the  Lord‟s  Name  are  sacred.  All  the  homes,  temples,  palaces  and  way-
stations  are  sacred,  where  the  Gurmukhs,  the  selfless  servants,  the  Sikhs  and  the 
renouncers  of  the  world,  go  and  take  their  rest.  All  the  horses,  saddles  and  horse 
blankets  are  sacred,  upon  which  the  Gurmukhs,  the  Sikhs,  the  Holy  and  the  Saints, 
mount and ride. All the rituals and Dharmic practices and deeds are sacred, for those 
who  utter  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har,  the  True  Name  of  the  Lord.  Those 
Gurmukhs, those Sikhs, who have purity as their treasure, go to their Guru.  || 16 ||   
SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, forsaking the Name, he loses everything, in this 
world and the next. Chanting, deep meditation and austere self-disciplined practices are 
all wasted; he is deceived by the love of duality. He is bound and gagged at the door of 
the Messenger of Death.
