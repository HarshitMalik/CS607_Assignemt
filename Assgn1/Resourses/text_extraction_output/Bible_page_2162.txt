  2163    Luke 4 
4 
The Temptation of Jesus 
1  And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and 
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
2  being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat 
nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 
 
3  And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command 
this stone that it be made bread. 
4  And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not 
live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 
5  And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto 
him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the 
glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I 
   
will, I give it. 
7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 
8  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: 
 
for it is written, 
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, 
and him only shalt thou serve.  
9  And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the 
temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself 
down from hence: 
 
10  for it is written, 
He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:  
 
11  and in their hands they shall bear thee up, 
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
12  And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt 
the Lord thy God.  
13  And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed 
from him for a season.
