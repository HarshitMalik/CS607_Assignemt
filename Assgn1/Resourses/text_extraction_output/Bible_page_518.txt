done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he 
 
had done also to Libnah, and to her king. 
40  ¶ So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and 
of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none 
 
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord 
God of Israel commanded. 
41  And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and 
all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
42  And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, 
because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. 
43  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to 
Gilgal.

The Defeat of Jabin’s Alliance 
1  And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those 
things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of 
Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
2  and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of 
the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the 
borders of Dor on the west, 
3  and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the 
Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the 
mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
4  And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much 
people, even as the sand that is upon the seashore in multitude, 
with horses and chariots very many. 
5  And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched 
together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. 
6  ¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: 
 
for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before 
Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with 
 
fire.
