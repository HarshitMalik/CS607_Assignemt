  1799    Ezekiel 22 
discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I 
 
say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the 
hand. 
25  And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, 
when iniquity shall have an end, 
26  thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the 
 
crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him

he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

29  while they see vanity unto thee, while they divine a lie unto thee,

32  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of 
 
the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the Lord have 
   
spoken it.
