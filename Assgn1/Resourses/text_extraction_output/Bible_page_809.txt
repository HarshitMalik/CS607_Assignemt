  810    1 Kings 16 
9  And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired 
against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the 
house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. 
10  And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty 
and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 
11  ¶ And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on 
his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one 
 
that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolk, nor of his 
friends. 
12  Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the 
word of the Lord, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the 
prophet, 
13  for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which 
they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the 
Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
14  Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
15  ¶ In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri 
reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against 
Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
16  And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath 
conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made 
 
Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
17  And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and 
they besieged Tirzah. 
18  And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that 
he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s 
house over him with fire, and died, 
19  for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord, 
in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to 
make Israel to sin. 
20  Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, 
are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of 
Israel?
