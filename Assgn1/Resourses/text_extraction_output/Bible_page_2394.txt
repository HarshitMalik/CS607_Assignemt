  2395    Romans 3 
3 
1  What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of 
 
circumcision? 
 
2  Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed 
 
the oracles of God. 
3  For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the 
 
faith of God without effect? 
 
4  God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is 
   
written, 
That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, 
and mightest overcome when thou art judged.  
5  But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, 
what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I 
   
speak as a man) 
6  God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
   
7  For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto 
his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 
   
8  and not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm 
that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation 
 
is just. 
There Is None Righteous 
9  Â¶ What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have 
     
before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; 
 
10  as it is written, 
There is none righteous, no, not one: 
 
11  there is none that understandeth, 
there is none that seeketh after God. 
12  They are all gone out of the way, 
they are together become unprofitable; 
 
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  
13  Their throat is an open sepulchre; 
 
with their tongues they have used deceit;
