  2441    1 Corinthians 11 
Do All to the Glory of God 
23  ¶ All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all 
 
things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 
24  Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth. 
25  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for 
conscience’ sake: 
 
26  for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.  
27  If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed 
to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for 
 
conscience’ sake. 
28  But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, 
eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake: for the 
 
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof: 
 
29  conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my 
 
liberty judged of another man’s conscience? 
 
30  For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for 
which I give thanks? 
 
31  ¶ Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to 
the glory of God. 
32  Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to 
the church of God: 
 
33  even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, 
but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

1  Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

2  ¶ Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, 
and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
