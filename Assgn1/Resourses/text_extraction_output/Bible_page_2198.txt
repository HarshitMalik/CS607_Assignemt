  2199    Luke 12 
28  If then God so clothe the grass, which is today in the field, and 
tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, 
 
O ye of little faith? 
 
29  And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be 
ye of doubtful mind. 
30  For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your 
 
Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. 
31  But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be 
 
added unto you. 
Treasure in Heaven 
32  ¶ Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give 
 
you the kingdom. 
33  Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax 
 
not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief 
approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. 
34  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
Watchful Servants 
35  ¶ Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;  
 
36  and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he 
will return from the wedding; that, when he cometh and knocketh, 
 
they may open unto him immediately. 
37  Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall 
find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and 
 
make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve 
them. 
38  And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third 
watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. 
39  And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what 
hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have 
suffered his house to be broken through.
