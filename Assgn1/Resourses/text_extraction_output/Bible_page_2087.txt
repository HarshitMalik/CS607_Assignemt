  2088    Matthew 26 
55  In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as 
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily 
 
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
56  But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be 
fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. 
Jesus before the Council 
57  ¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the 
high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 
58  But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and 
went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 
59  Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false 
witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 
 
60  but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found 
 
they none. At the last came two false witnesses, 
61  and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, 
and to build it in three days.  
62  And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou 
nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
   
63  But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said 
unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether 
thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
64  Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, 
 
Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of 
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  
65  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken 
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now 
   
ye have heard his blasphemy. 
66  What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  
 
67  Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote 
 
him with the palms of their hands,  
68  saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
