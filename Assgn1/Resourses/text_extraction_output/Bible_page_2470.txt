  2471    2 Corinthians 11 
13  ¶ But we will not boast of things without our measure, but 
according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to 
us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
14  For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we 
reached not unto you; for we are come as far as to you also in 
 
preaching the gospel of Christ: 
 
15  not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s 
labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall 
 
be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
16  to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in 
another man’s line of things made ready to our hand. 
17  But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  
18  For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the 
Lord commendeth. 
11 
1  Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed 
 
bear with me. 
2  For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused 
 
you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to 
Christ. 
3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through 
his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity 
that is in Christ. 
4  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not 
preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not 
received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might 
well bear with him. 
5  For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
6  But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have 
 
been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things. 
7  ¶ Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that ye might be 
exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
 
8  I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
