  1445    Proverbs 24 
30  They that tarry long at the wine; 
 
they that go to seek mixed wine. 
31  Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, 
when it giveth his color in the cup, 
when it moveth itself aright. 
32  At the last it biteth like a serpent, 
and stingeth like an adder. 
33  Thine eyes shall behold strange women, 
and thine heart shall utter perverse things. 
34  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, 
or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 
35  They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; 
 
they have beaten me, and I felt it not: 
 
when shall I awake? 
 
I will seek it yet again. 
24 
1  Be not thou envious against evil men, 
neither desire to be with them: 
 
2  for their heart studieth destruction, 
and their lips talk of mischief. 
3  Through wisdom is a house builded; 
 
and by understanding it is established: 
 
4  and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled 
with all precious and pleasant riches. 
5  A wise man is strong; 
 
yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 
6  For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: 
 
and in multitude of counselors there is safety. 
7  Wisdom is too high for a fool: 
 
he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 
8  He that deviseth to do evil 
shall be called a mischievous person. 
9  The thought of foolishness is sin:
