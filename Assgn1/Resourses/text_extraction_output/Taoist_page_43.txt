The  human  body  has  twelve  main  energy  channels  and
eight extra energy channels, but only the two known as the
passive and the active channels are connected with human
life and death.
In  ordinary  people,  the  passive  channel  is  in  the
abdomen going upward, while the active channel is in the
back  going  downward.  Front  and  back  are  separated,  so
the mechanism of transformation has no basis. Thus their
length  of  life  depends  on  the  extent  of  the  energy  they
were born with.
Practitioners of wizardry recognize the passive channel
is where all the yin channels meet and the active channel is
what  unifies  all  the  yang  channels.  If  these  two  channels
are  free-flowing,  the  hundred  channels  will  flow  freely.
Therefore  they  repel  convergence  of  negative  energy  and
promote the fire of positive energy, practicing the method
of the turning of the waterwheel.
This method is freezing the spirit in the energy opening.
This is called returning to the root. With spirit and energy
keeping  to  each  other,  embrace  unity  without  parting.
When  stillness  climaxes  followed  by  movement,  this  is
spirit  again  rising  up  the  energy  root  to  nirvana.  At  this
point  the  course  of  the  waterwheel  goes  through  for  the
first time.
If you want to know the course of the waterwheel, it is
the  passive  and  active  energy  channels  in  our  bodies.
When  energy  first  arises,  it  steams  between  the  kidneys
and genitals, then overflows above the small of the back,
