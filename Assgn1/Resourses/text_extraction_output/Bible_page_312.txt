  313    Numbers 4 
23  from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou 
number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the 
 
work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
24  This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and 
for burdens: 
 
25  and they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the 
tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of 
the badgers’ skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
26  and the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the 
gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round 
about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and 
all that is made for them: so shall they serve. 
 
27  At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of 
the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their 
service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. 
 
28  This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the 
tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the 
 
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
29  ¶ As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their 
families, by the house of their fathers; 
 
30  from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt 
thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do 
the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
31  And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service 
in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, 
 
and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, 
32  and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and 
their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all 
their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the 
 
charge of their burden. 
33  This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to 
all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the 
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
