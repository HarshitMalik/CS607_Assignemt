  1218    Psalms 18 
18 
Thanksgiving for Deliverance 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who spake unto 
the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord 
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the 
hand of Saul: And he said, 
 
1  I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. 
2  The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 
 
my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; 
 
my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. 
3  I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: 
 
so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 
4  The sorrows of death compassed me, 
and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. 
5  The sorrows of hell compassed me about: 
 
the snares of death prevented me. 
6  In my distress I called upon the Lord, 
and cried unto my God: 
 
he heard my voice out of his temple, 
and my cry came before him, even into his ears. 
7  Then the earth shook and trembled; 
 
the foundations also of the hills moved 
and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
8  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, 
and fire out of his mouth devoured: 
 
coals were kindled by it. 
9  He bowed the heavens also, and came down: 
 
and darkness was under his feet. 
10  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: 
 
yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
11  He made darkness his secret place;
