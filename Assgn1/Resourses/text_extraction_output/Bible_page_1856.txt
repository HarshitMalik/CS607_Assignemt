  1857    Ezekiel 44 
12  Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused 
the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up 
 
mine hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear 
their iniquity. 
13  And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest 
unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most 
holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations 
 
which they have committed. 
14  But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the 
service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. 
15  Â¶ But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge 
of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, 
they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall 
stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the 
Lord God: 
 
16  they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my 
table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. 
17  And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the 
inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no 
 
wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the 
inner court, and within. 
18  They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have 
linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with 
 
any thing that causeth sweat. 
19  And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer 
court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they 
ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put 
on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with 
 
their garments. 
20  Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow 
long; they shall only poll their heads. 
 
21  Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner 
court.
