  1004    2 Chronicles 17 
10  Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; 
 
for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa 
oppressed some of the people the same time. 
11  ¶ And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in 
the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
12  And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his 
feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he 
 
sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians. 
13  And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year 
of his reign. 
14  And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for 
himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was 
filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the 
apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.

Jehoshaphat’s Kingdom Established 
1  And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened 
himself against Israel. 
2  And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set 
garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which 
Asa his father had taken. 
3  And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the 
first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 
 
4  but sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his 
commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 
5  Therefore the Lord stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all 
 
Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and 
 
honor in abundance. 
6  And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord: moreover he 
 
took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
