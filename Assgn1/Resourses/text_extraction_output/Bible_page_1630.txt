  1631    Jeremiah 9 
9 
1  Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, 
that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my 
people! 
 
2  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; 
 
that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all 
 
adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. 
3  And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not 
 
valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to 
 
evil, and they know not me, saith the Lord. 
4  Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any 
brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every 
 
neighbor will walk with slanders. 
5  And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak 
the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary 
 
themselves to commit iniquity. 
6  Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they 
 
refuse to know me, saith the Lord. 
7  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, 
and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? 
   
8  Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one 
   
speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he 
layeth his wait. 
9  Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my 
   
soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
 
10  ¶ For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for 
the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are 
burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men 
 
hear the voice of the cattle: both the fowl of the heavens and the 
 
beast are fled; they are gone. 
 
11  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will 
 
make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
