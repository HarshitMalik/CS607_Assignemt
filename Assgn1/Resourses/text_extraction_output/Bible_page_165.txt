  166    Exodus 18 
13  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the 
sword. 
14  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a 
book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out 
 
the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.  
15  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi 
[the Lord my banner]: 
 
16  for he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have 
war with Amalek from generation to generation.
