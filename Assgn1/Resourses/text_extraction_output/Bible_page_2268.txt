  2269    John 9 
52  Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. 
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep 
 
my saying, he shall never taste of death. 
53  Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the 
 
prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

59  Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and 
 
went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so 
passed by.

night cometh, when no man can work. 
5  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  
6  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of 
the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
