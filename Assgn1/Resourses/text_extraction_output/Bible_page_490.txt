  491    Deuteronomy 33 
from his right hand went a fiery law for them. 
3  Yea, he loved the people; 
 
all his saints are in thy hand: 
 
and they sat down at thy feet; 
 
every one shall receive of thy words. 
4  Moses commanded us a law, 
even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. 
5  And he was king in Jeshurun, 
when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered 
together. 
6  Let Reuben live, and not die; 
 
and let not his men be few. 
7  ¶ And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, 
 
Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, 
and bring him unto his people: 
 
let his hands be sufficient for him; 
 
and be thou a help to him from his enemies. 
8  ¶ And of Levi he said, 
Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, 
whom thou didst prove at Massah,  
and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;  
 
9  who said unto his father and to his mother, 
I have not seen him; 
 
neither did he acknowledge his brethren, 
nor knew his own children: 
 
for they have observed thy word, 
and kept thy covenant. 
10  They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, 
and Israel thy law: 
 
they shall put incense before thee, 
and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. 
11  Bless, Lord, his substance, 
and accept the work of his hands: 
 
smite through the loins of them that rise against him, 
and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
