  1231    Psalms 27 
5  I have hated the congregation of evildoers; 
 
and will not sit with the wicked. 
6  I will wash mine hands in innocency: 
 
so will I compass thine altar, O Lord: 
 
7  that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, 
and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
8  Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, 
and the place where thine honor dwelleth. 
9  Gather not my soul with sinners, 
nor my life with bloody men: 
 
10  in whose hands is mischief, 
and their right hand is full of bribes. 
11  But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: 
 
redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 
12  My foot standeth in an even place: 
 
in the congregations will I bless the Lord.

The Lord Is My Light and My Salvation 
A Psalm of David. 
1  The Lord is my light and my salvation; 
 
whom shall I fear? 
 
The Lord is the strength of my life; 
 
of whom shall I be afraid? 
 
2  When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, 
came upon me to eat up my flesh, 
they stumbled and fell. 
3  Though a host should encamp against me, 
my heart shall not fear: 
 
though war should rise against me, 
in this will I be confident. 
4  One thing have I desired of the Lord,
