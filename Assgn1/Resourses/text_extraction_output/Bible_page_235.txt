  236    Leviticus 5 
5  And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that 
he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 
 
6  and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin 
which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb, or a kid of 
the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement 
 
for him concerning his sin. 
7  ¶ And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his 
trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin offering, and the other for a 
 
burnt offering. 
8  And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which 
is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but 
shall not divide it asunder: 
 
9  and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side 
of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the 
 
bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering. 
 
10  And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the 
manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin 
 
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. 
11  ¶ But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth 
part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil 
 
upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin 
 
offering. 
12  Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his 
handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, 
according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: it is a sin 
 
offering. 
13  And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin 
that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: 
 
and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as a meat offering.
