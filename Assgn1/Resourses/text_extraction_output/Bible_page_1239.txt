  1240    Psalms 34 
he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 
11  The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, 
the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 
12  Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; 
 
and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
13  The Lord looketh from heaven; 
 
he beholdeth all the sons of men. 
14  From the place of his habitation he looketh 
upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 
15  He fashioneth their hearts alike; 
 
he considereth all their works. 
16  There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: 
 
a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
17  A horse is a vain thing for safety: 
 
neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 
18  Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, 
upon them that hope in his mercy; 
 
19  to deliver their soul from death, 
and to keep them alive in famine. 
20  Our soul waiteth for the Lord: 
 
he is our help and our shield. 
21  For our heart shall rejoice in him, 
because we have trusted in his holy name. 
22  Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, 
according as we hope in thee.

Praise for Deliverance from Troubles 
A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before 
Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. 
 
1  I will bless the Lord at all times: 
 
his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
