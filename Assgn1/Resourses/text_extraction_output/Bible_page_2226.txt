  2227    Luke 21 
12  But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and 
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into 
prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake. 
13  And it shall turn to you for a testimony. 
14  Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye 
shall answer: 
 
15  for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries 
shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  
16  And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and 
kinsfolk, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to 
 
death. 
17  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake. 
18  But there shall not a hair of your head perish. 
19  In your patience possess ye your souls. 
20  ¶ And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then 
know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 
21  Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let 
 
them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that 
 
are in the countries enter thereinto. 
22  For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written 
may be fulfilled. 
23  But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, 
in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath 
 
upon this people. 
24  And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away 
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the 
 
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 
The Coming of the Son of Man 
25  ¶ And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the 
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the 
   
sea and the waves roaring;
