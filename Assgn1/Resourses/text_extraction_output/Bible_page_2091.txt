  2092    Matthew 27 
33  And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to 
say, a place of a skull, 
34  they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had 
 
tasted thereof, he would not drink. 
35  And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that 
 
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, 
They parted my garments among them, 
and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  
36  And sitting down they watched him there; 
 
37  and set up over his head his accusation written, This is jesus the 
king of the jews. 
38  Then were there two thieves crucified with him; one on the right 
 
hand, and another on the left. 
39  And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  
40  and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three 
days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the 
cross. 
41  Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and 
elders, said, 
42  He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, 
 
let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
43  He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for 
   
he said, I am the Son of God. 
44  The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in 
his teeth. 
45  Â¶ Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land 
unto the ninth hour. 
46  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, 
Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast 
 
thou forsaken me?  
 
47  Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This 
man calleth for Elijah. 
48  And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it 
with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
