threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and 
 
threescore daughters.) 
22  And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be 
ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king. 
 
23  And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all 
the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and 
 
he gave them victuals in abundance. And he desired many wives.

Shishakâ€™s Invasion of Judah 
1  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, 
and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and 
all Israel with him. 
2  And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, 
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had 
transgressed against the Lord, 
3  with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: 
 
and the people were without number that came with him out of 
Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. 
 
4  And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to 
Jerusalem. 
5  Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes 
of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of 
Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Ye have 
forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of 
Shishak. 
6  Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; 
 
and they said, The Lord is righteous. 
7  And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word 
of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled 
themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them 
 
some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon 
 
Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
