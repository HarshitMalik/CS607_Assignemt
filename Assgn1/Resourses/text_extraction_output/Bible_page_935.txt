  936    1 Chronicles 13 
39  And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: 
 
for their brethren had prepared for them. 
40  Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and 
Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and 
on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches 
of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for 
 
there was joy in Israel.

David Proposes to Bring the Ark to Jerusalem 
1  And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, 
and with every leader. 
2  And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good 
unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad 
unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, 
and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities 
and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: 
 
3  and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not 
 
at it in the days of Saul. 
4  And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing 
 
was right in the eyes of all the people. 
David Goes to Get the Ark 
5  Â¶ So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even 
unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-
jearim.  
6  And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-
jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God 
the Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubim, whose name is 
called on it. 
7  And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of 
Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
