a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became 
Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

The Jews Destroy Their Enemies 
1  Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the 
thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his 
decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies 
of the Jews hoped to have power over them; (though it was turned 
 
to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them,) 
2  the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all 
the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought 
their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them 
   
fell upon all people. 
3  And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the 
deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear 
 
of Mordecai fell upon them. 
4  For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out 
throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater 
 
and greater. 
5  Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, 
and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto 
those that hated them. 
6  And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five 
hundred men. 
7  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
8  and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 
9  and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 
10  the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the 
Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. 
 
11  ¶ On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the 
palace was brought before the king.
