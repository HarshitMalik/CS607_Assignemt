THE YOGA OF LIBERATION BY RENUNCIATION
62. Fly unto Him for refuge with all thy being, O Arjuna! By His Grace thou shalt obtain
supreme peace and the eternal abode.
Iti te jnaanamaakhyaatam guhyaad guhyataram mayaa;
Vimrishyaitadasheshena yathecchasi tathaa kuru.
63. Thus has wisdom more secret than secrecy itself been declared unto thee by Me; having
reflected over it fully, then act thou as thou wishest.
Sarvaguhyatamam bhooyah shrinu me paramam vachah;
Ishto’si me dridhamiti tato vakshyaami te hitam.
64. Hear thou again My supreme word, most secret of all; because thou art dearly beloved of
Me, I will tell thee what is good.
Manmanaa bhava madbhakto madyaajee maam namaskuru;
Maamevaishyasi satyam te pratijaane priyo’si me.
65. Fix thy mind on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Thou shalt
come even to Me; truly do I promise unto thee, (for) thou art dear to Me.
Sarvadharmaan parityajya maamekam sharanam vraja;
Aham twaa sarvapaapebhyo mokshayishyaami maa shuchah.
66. Abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me alone; I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve
not.
Idam te naatapaskaaya naabhaktaaya kadaachana;
Na chaashushrooshave vaachyam na cha maam yo’bhyasooyati.
67. This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities, to one who is not
devoted, nor to one who does not render service, nor who does not desire to listen, nor to one who
cavils at Me.
Ya imam paramam guhyam madbhakteshvabhidhaasyati;
Bhaktim mayi paraam kritwaa maamevaishyatyasamshayah.
68. He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this supreme secret to My devotees,
shall doubtless come to Me.
Na cha tasmaanmanushyeshu kashchinme priyakrittamah;
Bhavitaa na cha me tasmaadanyah priyataro bhuvi.
69. Nor is there any among men who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on
earth dearer to Me than he.
