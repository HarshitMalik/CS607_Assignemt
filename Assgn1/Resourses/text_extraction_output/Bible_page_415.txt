  416    Deuteronomy 4 
4 
Moses Exhorts Israel to Obedience 
1  Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the 
judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and 
go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers 
giveth you. 
2  Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall 
ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of 
the Lord your God which I command you. 
3  Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for all 
 
the men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed 
them from among you.  
4  But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one 
of you this day. 
5  Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the 
Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land 
whither ye go to possess it. 
6  Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your 
 
understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these 
statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and 
understanding people. 
7  For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, 
as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? 
 
8  And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments 
so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 
 
Israel’s Experience at Horeb 
9  ¶ Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou 
forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart 
from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and 
 
thy sons’ sons;
