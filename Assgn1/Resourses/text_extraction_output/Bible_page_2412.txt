  2413    Romans 11 
19  Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be 
graffed in. 
20  Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest 
 
by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: 
 
21  for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also 
spare not thee. 
22  Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which 
 
fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his 
 
goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 
 
23  And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: 
 
for God is able to graff them in again. 
24  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, 
and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how 
 
much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed 
into their own olive tree? 
 
The Restoration of Israel 
25  ¶ For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this 
mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness 
in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be 
come in. 
26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, 
 
There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, 
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  
 
27  for this is my covenant unto them, 
when I shall take away their sins.  
28  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as 
 
touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes. 
29  For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 
30  For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now 
obtained mercy through their unbelief: 
 
31  even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy 
they also may obtain mercy.
