  850    2 Kings 8 
(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: 
 
behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Isrealites that 
are consumed:) and let us send and see. 
 
14  They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the 
 
host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 
15  And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full 
 
of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their 
haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. 
16  ¶ And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So 
a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of 
barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord. 
17  And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have 
the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, 
 
and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king 
came down to him. 
18  And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, 
saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine 
flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of 
Samaria: 
 
19  and that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if 
the Lord should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? 
 
And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not 
eat thereof. 
20  And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the 
 
gate, and he died.

The Shunammite Woman’s Land Restored 
1  Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to 
life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn 
wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the Lord hath called for a 
 
famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
