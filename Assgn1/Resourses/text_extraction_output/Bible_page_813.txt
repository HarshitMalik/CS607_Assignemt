  814    1 Kings 18 
21  And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried 
unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this 
child’s soul come into him again. 
22  And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child 
 
came into him again, and he revived. 
23  And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the 
chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and 
 
Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
24  And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a 
man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.

Elijah Returns to Ahab 
1  And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord 
came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto 
Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 
 
2  And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore 
famine in Samaria. 
3  And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. 
(Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly: 
 
4  for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that 
Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, 
and fed them with bread and water.) 
5  And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains 
of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to 
 
save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
6  So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab 
 
went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by 
himself. 
7  ¶ And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he 
 
knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord 
Elijah? 
 
8  And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
