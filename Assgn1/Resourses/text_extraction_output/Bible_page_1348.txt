  1349    Psalms 107 
26  They mount up to the heaven, 
they go down again to the depths: 
 
their soul is melted because of trouble. 
27  They reel to and fro, 
and stagger like a drunken man, 
and are at their witâ€™s end. 
28  Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, 
and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
29  He maketh the storm a calm, 
so that the waves thereof are still. 
30  Then are they glad because they be quiet; 
 
so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
31  Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, 
and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
 
32  Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, 
and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
33  He turneth rivers into a wilderness, 
and the watersprings into dry ground; 
 
34  a fruitful land into barrenness, 
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 
35  He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, 
and dry ground into watersprings. 
36  And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, 
that they may prepare a city for habitation; 
 
37  and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, 
which may yield fruits of increase. 
38  He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; 
 
and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 
39  Again, they are minished and brought low 
through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
40  He poureth contempt upon princes, 
and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no 
way. 
41  Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, 
and maketh him families like a flock.
