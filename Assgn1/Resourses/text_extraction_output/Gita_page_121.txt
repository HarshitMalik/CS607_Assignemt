THE YOGA OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD & THE KNOWER OF THE FIELD
Vinashyatswavinashyantam yah pashyati sa pashyati.
28. He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing equally in all beings, the unperishing
within the perishing.
COMMENTARY: Birth is the root cause of the modifications of change, growth, decay
and death. The other changes of state manifest after the birth of the body. But the Lord is changeless
and He is birthless, decayless and deathless.
Samam pashyan hi sarvatra samavasthitameeshwaram;
Na hinastyaatmanaa’tmaanam tato yaati paraam gatim.
29. Because he who sees the same Lord dwelling equally everywhere does not destroy the
Self by the self, he goes to the highest goal.
Prakrityaiva cha karmaani kriyamaanaani sarvashah;
Yah pashyati tathaa’tmaanam akartaaram sa pashyati.
30. He sees, who sees that all actions are performed by Nature alone and that the Self is
actionless.
Yadaa bhootaprithagbhaavam ekastham anupashyati;
Tata eva cha vistaaram brahma sampadyate tadaa.
31. When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth
from That alone, he then becomes Brahman.
COMMENTARY: A man attains to unity with the Supreme when he knows or realises
through intuition that all these manifold forms are rooted in the One. Like waves in water, like rays
in the sun, so also all forms are rooted in the One.
Anaaditwaan nirgunatwaat paramaatmaayam avyayah;
Shareerastho’pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate.
32. Being without beginning and devoid of (any) qualities, the Supreme Self, imperishable,
though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted!
Yathaa sarvagatam saukshmyaadaakaasham nopalipyate;
Sarvatraavasthito dehe tathaatmaa nopalipyate.
33. As the all-pervading ether is not tainted because of its subtlety, so the Self seated
everywhere in the body, is not tainted.
Yathaa prakaashayatyekah kritsnam lokamimam ravih;
Kshetram kshetree tathaa kritsnam prakaashayati bhaarata.
