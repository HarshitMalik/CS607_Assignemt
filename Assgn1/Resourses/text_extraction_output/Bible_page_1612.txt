  1613    Jeremiah 2 
3  Israel was holiness unto the Lord, and the firstfruits of his 
increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon 
   
them, saith the Lord. 
4  ¶ Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the 
families of the house of Israel: 
 
5  thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, 
that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and 
are become vain? 
 
6  Neither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the 
land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of 
deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of 
death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no 
man dwelt? 
 
7  And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof 
and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, 
 
and made mine heritage an abomination. 
8  The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the 
 
law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the 
 
prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not 
profit. 
9  ¶ Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with 
your children’s children will I plead. 
10  For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, 
 
and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. 
11  Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my 
 
people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. 
12  Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye 
very desolate, saith the Lord. 
13  For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me 
 
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken 
cisterns, that can hold no water. 
14  ¶ Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled? 
     
15  The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his 
land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
