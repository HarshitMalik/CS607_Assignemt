THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
Na tu maam shakyase drashtum anenaiva swachakshushaa;
Divyam dadaami te chakshuh pashya me yogamaishwaram.
8. But thou art not able to behold Me with these, thine own eyes; I give thee the divine eye;
behold My lordly Yoga.
COMMENTARY: No fleshy eye can behold Me in My Cosmic Form. One can see Me
only through the eye of intuition or the divine eye. It should not be confused with seeing through the
physical eye or through the mind. It is an inner divine experience attained through intense devotion
and concentration.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Evamuktwaa tato raajan mahaayogeshwaro harih;
Darshayaamaasa paarthaaya paramam roopamaishwaram.
Sanjaya said:
9. Having thus spoken, O king, the great Lord of Yoga, Hari (Krishna), showed to Arjuna
His supreme form as the Lord!
Anekavaktra nayanam anekaadbhuta darshanam;
Anekadivyaabharanam divyaanekodyataayudham.
10. With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wonderful sights, with numerous
divine ornaments, with numerous divine weapons uplifted (such a form He showed).
Divyamaalyaambaradharam divyagandhaanulepanam;
Sarvaashcharyamayam devam anantam vishwatomukham.
11. Wearing divine garlands and apparel, anointed with divine unguents, the all-wonderful,
resplendent (Being), endless, with faces on all sides,
Divi sooryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitaa;
Yadi bhaah sadrishee saa syaadbhaasastasya mahaatmanah.
12. If the splendour of a thousand suns were to blaze out at once (simultaneously) in the sky,
that would be the splendour of that mighty Being (great soul).
Tatraikastham jagatkritsnam pravibhaktamanekadhaa;
Apashyaddevadevasya shareere paandavastadaa.
13. There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the whole universe resting in the
one, with its many groups.
Tatah sa vismayaavishto hrishtaromaa dhananjayah;
Pranamya shirasaa devam kritaanjalirabhaashata.
