  1145    Job 10 
34  Let him take his rod away from me, 
and let not his fear terrify me: 
 
35  then would I speak, and not fear him; 
 
but it is not so with me.

Job Bemoans His Condition

I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
2  I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; 
 
show me wherefore thou contendest with me.

and searchest after my sin? 
 
7  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; 
 
and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
8  Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round

yet thou dost destroy me. 
9  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; 
 
and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 
 
10  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, 
and curdled me like cheese? 
 
11  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, 
and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 
12  Thou hast granted me life and favor,
