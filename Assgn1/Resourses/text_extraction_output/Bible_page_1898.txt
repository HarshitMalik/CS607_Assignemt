  1899    Daniel 11 
The King of the North and the King of the South 
2  ¶ And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up 
yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they 
 
all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against 
 
the realm of Grecia. 
3  And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great 
dominion, and do according to his will. 
4  And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall 
be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his 
 
posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his 
 
kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides those. 
5  ¶ And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; 
 
and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his 
 
dominion shall be a great dominion. 
6  And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the 
 
king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to 
make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; 
   
neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and 
 
they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that 
strengthened her in these times. 
7  ¶ But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, 
which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of 
the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall 
prevail: 
 
8  and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their 
princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he 
 
shall continue more years than the king of the north. 
9  So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall 
return into his own land. 
10  ¶ But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of 
great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass 
 
through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress. 
 
11  And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall 
come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and
