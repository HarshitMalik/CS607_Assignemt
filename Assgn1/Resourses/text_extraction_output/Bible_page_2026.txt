  2027    Matthew 7 
A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit 
15  ¶ Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, 
but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
16  Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 
 
17  Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 
18  A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree 
bring forth good fruit. 
19  Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and 
cast into the fire.  
20  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  
I Never Knew You 
21  ¶ Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which 
 
is in heaven. 
22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not 
prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and 
   
in thy name done many wonderful works? 
 
23  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from 
 
me, ye that work iniquity.  
The Two Foundations 
24  ¶ Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth 
them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon 
a rock: 
 
25  and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a 
   
rock.
