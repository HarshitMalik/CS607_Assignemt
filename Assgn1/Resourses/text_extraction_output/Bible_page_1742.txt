  1743    Lamentations 2 
he hath destroyed his strongholds, 
and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and 
lamentation. 
6  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a 
garden; 
 
he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: 
 
the Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be 
forgotten in Zion, 
and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the 
priest. 
7  The Lord hath cast off his altar, 
he hath abhorred his sanctuary, 
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her 
palaces; 
 
they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, 
as in the day of a solemn feast. 
8  The Lord hath purposed to destroy 
the wall of the daughter of Zion: 
 
he hath stretched out a line, 
he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: 
 
therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; 
 
they languished together. 
9  Her gates are sunk into the ground; 
 
he hath destroyed and broken her bars: 
 
her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: 
 
the law is no more; 
 
her prophets also find no vision from the Lord. 
10  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep 
silence: 
 
they have cast up dust upon their heads; 
 
they have girded themselves with sackcloth: 
 
the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 
11  Mine eyes do fail with tears, 
my bowels are troubled, 
my liver is poured upon the earth,
