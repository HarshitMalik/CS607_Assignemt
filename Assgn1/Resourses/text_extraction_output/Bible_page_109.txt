  110    Genesis 45 
33  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a 
bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
 
34  For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest 
 
peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

Joseph Makes Himself Known to His Brethren 
1  Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by 
him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there 
 
stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto 
his brethren.  
2  And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh 
 
heard. 
3  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet 
 
live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were 
   
troubled at his presence. 
4  Â¶ And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. 
And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom 
ye sold into Egypt. 
5  Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye 
sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
 
6  For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there 
 
are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. 
7  And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the 
earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
8  So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath 
 
made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler 
throughout all the land of Egypt. 
9  Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy 
son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto 
 
me, tarry not:
