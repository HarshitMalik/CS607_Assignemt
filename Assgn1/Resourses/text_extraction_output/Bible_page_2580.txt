  2581    James 4 
7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will 
flee from you. 
8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your 
hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. 
 
9  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to 
 
mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 
10  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. 
Judging a Brother 
11  ¶ Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of 
his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and 
judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the 
 
law, but a judge. 
12  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art 
 
thou that judgest another? 
 
Boast Not of Tomorrow 
13  ¶ Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a 
city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: 
 
14  whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your 
life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then 
 
vanisheth away. 
15  For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, 
or that. 
16  But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 
 
17  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him 
it is sin.
