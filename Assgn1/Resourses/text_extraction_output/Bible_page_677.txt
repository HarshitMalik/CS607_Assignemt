  678    1 Samuel 25 
18  And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with 
me: forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine 
 
hand, thou killedst me not. 
19  For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? 
 
wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto 
me this day. 
20  And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and 
that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 
21  Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut 
off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out 
of my father’s house. 
22  And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and 
 
his men gat them up unto the hold.

David and Abigail 
1  And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and 
 
lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. 
¶ And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
2  And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; 
 
and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and 
a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
 
3  Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife 
Abigail; and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a 
 
beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his 
 
doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. 
 
4  And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. 
5  And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young 
men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my 
name: 
 
6  and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to 
thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou 
hast.
