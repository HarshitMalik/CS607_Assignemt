have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread 
 
alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the 
king’s sons.

Mephibosheth. 
13  So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at 
 
the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.

5  When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the 
men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until 
 
your beards be grown, and then return. 
6  ¶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
