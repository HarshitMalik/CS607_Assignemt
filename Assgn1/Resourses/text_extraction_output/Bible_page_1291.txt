  1292    Psalms 70 
70 
A Prayer for Deliverance 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. 
1  Make haste, O God, to deliver me; 
 
make haste to help me, O Lord. 
2  Let them be ashamed and confounded 
that seek after my soul: 
 
let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, 
that desire my hurt. 
3  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame 
that say, Aha, aha. 
4  Let all those that seek thee 
rejoice and be glad in thee: 
 
and let such as love thy salvation 
say continually, Let God be magnified. 
5  But I am poor and needy; 
 
make haste unto me, O God: 
 
thou art my help and my deliverer; 
 
O Lord, make no tarrying.

The Prayer of an Old Man 
1  In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust: 
 
let me never be put to confusion. 
2  Deliver me in thy righteousness, 
and cause me to escape: 
 
incline thine ear unto me, 
and save me. 
3  Be thou my strong habitation,
