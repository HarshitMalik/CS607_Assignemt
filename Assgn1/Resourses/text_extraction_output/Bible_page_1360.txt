  1361    Psalms 118 
they are quenched as the fire of thorns: 
 
for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 
13  Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: 
 
but the Lord helped me. 
14  The Lord is my strength and song, 
and is become my salvation.  
15  The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the 
righteous: 
 
the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. 
16  The right hand of the Lord is exalted: 
 
the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. 
17  I shall not die, but live, 
and declare the works of the Lord. 
18  The Lord hath chastened me sore: 
 
but he hath not given me over unto death. 
19  Open to me the gates of righteousness: 
 
I will go into them, 
and I will praise the Lord: 
 
20  this gate of the Lord, 
into which the righteous shall enter. 
21  I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, 
 
and art become my salvation. 
22  The stone which the builders refused 
is become the head stone of the corner.  
23  This is the Lordâ€™s doing; 
 
it is marvelous in our eyes.  
24  This is the day which the Lord hath made; 
 
we will rejoice and be glad in it. 
25  Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: 
 
O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. 
26  Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord:  
 
we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord. 
27  God is the Lord, which hath showed us light: 
 
bind the sacrifice with cords, 
even unto the horns of the altar.
