the laver and his foot; 
 
40  the hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the 
hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the 
vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the 
congregation; 
 
41  the clothes of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy 
garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister 
in the priest’s office. 
42  According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children 
of Israel made all the work. 
43  And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done 
it as the Lord had commanded, even so had they done it: and 
 
Moses blessed them.

The Setting Up of the Tabernacle 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle 
of the tent of the congregation. 
3  And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the 
ark with the veil. 
4  And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that 
are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the 
 
candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
5  And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of 
the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
6  And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of 
the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
7  And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation 
and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
8  And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the 
hanging at the court gate.
