name we go against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let 
 
not man prevail against thee. 
12  So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; 
 
and the Ethiopians fled. 
13  And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto 
Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not 
 
recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the Lord, and 
 
before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. 
 
14  And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the 
 
Lord came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there 
   
was exceeding much spoil in them. 
15  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and 
camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

Asaâ€™s Reforms 
1  And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
 
2  and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, 
and all Judah and Benjamin; The Lord is with you, while ye be 
 
with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye 
   
forsake him, he will forsake you. 
3  Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and 
without a teaching priest, and without law. 
4  But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of 
Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. 
5  And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to 
him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants 
of the countries. 
6  And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did 
 
vex them with all adversity. 
7  Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your 
 
work shall be rewarded.
