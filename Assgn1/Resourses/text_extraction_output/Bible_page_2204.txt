  2205    Luke 14 
14 
Jesus Heals the Man Who Had Dropsy 
1  And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief 
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. 
2  And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the 
dropsy. 
3  And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, 
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 
 
4  And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and 
let him go; 
 
5  and answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox 
fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the 
sabbath day?  
 
6  And they could not answer him again to these things.

7  ¶ And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he 
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, 
 
8  When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the 
highest room; lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of 
 
him; 
 
9  and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man 
place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. 
 
10  But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that 
 
when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go 
up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them 
 
that sit at meat with thee.  
11  For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that 
 
humbleth himself shall be exalted.  
12  ¶ Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a 
dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither
