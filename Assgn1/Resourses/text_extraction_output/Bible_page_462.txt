  463    Deuteronomy 23 
Laws of Sanitation 
9  ¶ When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee 
from every wicked thing. 
10  ¶ If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of 
uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad 
out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 
 
11  but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with 
water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp 
 
again. 
12  ¶ Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt 
go forth abroad: 
 
13  and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, 
 
when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and 
shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: 
 
14  for the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver 
thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy 
 
camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away 
 
from thee. 
Laws of Human Relations 
15  ¶ Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is 
escaped from his master unto thee: 
 
16  he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he 
shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt 
 
not oppress him. 
17  ¶ There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite 
of the sons of Israel. 
18  Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into 
the house of the Lord thy God for any vow: for even both these are 
 
abomination unto the Lord thy God. 
19  ¶ Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, 
 
usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
