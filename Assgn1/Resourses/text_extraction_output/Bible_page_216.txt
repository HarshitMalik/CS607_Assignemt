  217    Exodus 37 
12  Also he made thereunto a border of a handbreadth round about; 
 
and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 
13  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four 
corners that were in the four feet thereof. 
14  Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to 
bear the table. 
15  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with 
gold, to bear the table. 
16  And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and 
his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure 
gold. 
17  ¶ And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he 
 
the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and 
 
his flowers, were of the same: 
 
18  and six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of 
 
the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of 
the candlestick out of the other side thereof: 
 
19  three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a 
knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another 
 
branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going 
 
out of the candlestick. 
20  And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his 
knops, and his flowers: 
 
21  and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two 
branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, 
according to the six branches going out of it. 
22  Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one 
 
beaten work of pure gold. 
23  And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, 
of pure gold. 
24  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. 
25  ¶ And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it 
 
was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two 
   
cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.
