  2137    Mark 13 
8  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
 
and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be 
famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. 
 
9  ¶ But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to 
 
councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be 
   
brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against 
them. 
10  And the gospel must first be published among all nations. 
11  But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought 
beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but 
 
whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is 
 
not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  
12  Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father 
the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall 
 
cause them to be put to death. 
13  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that 
 
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  
14  ¶ But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of 
by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that 
readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judea flee to the 
mountains: 
 
15  and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, 
neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: 
 
16  and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his 
garment.  
17  But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in 
those days! 
 
18  And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. 
19  For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the 
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, 
neither shall be. 
20  And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should 
be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath 
 
shortened the days.
