  2176    Luke 7 
20  When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath 
sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we 
 
for another? 
 
21  And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and 
plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave 
 
sight. 
22  Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John 
what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the 
 
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are 
raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.  
23  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. 
24  ¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to 
speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the 
wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
   
25  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? 
   
Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, 
are in kings’ courts. 
26  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, 
   
and much more than a prophet. 
27  This is he, of whom it is written, 
Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, 
which shall prepare thy way before thee.  
28  For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is 
not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in 
 
the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
29  And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, 
being baptized with the baptism of John. 
30  But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against 
themselves, being not baptized of him.  
31  ¶ And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this 
generation? and to what are they like? 
   
32  They are like unto children sitting in the market place, and calling 
one to another, and saying, 
We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; 
 
we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
