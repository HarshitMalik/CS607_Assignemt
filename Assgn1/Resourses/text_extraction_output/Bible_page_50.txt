  51    Genesis 24 
24 
A Wife Obtained for Isaac 
1  And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had 
 
blessed Abraham in all things. 
2  And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled 
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
 
3  and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and 
the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of 
the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 
 
4  but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a 
wife unto my son Isaac. 
5  And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not 
be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son 
 
again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
 
6  And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my 
son thither again. 
7  The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, 
and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and 
that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he 
 
shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my 
son from thence. 
8  And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou 
shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither 
 
again. 
9  And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his 
master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 
10  ¶ And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and 
departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he 
   
arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 
11  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of 
water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out 
to draw water.
