dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the 
land. 
28  Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria 
came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear 
the Lord. 
29  Â¶ Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in 
the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, 
every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 
30  And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of 
Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
31  and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt 
their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods 
of Sepharvaim. 
32  So they feared the Lord, and made unto themselves of the lowest 
of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the 
houses of the high places. 
33  They feared the Lord, and served their own gods, after the manner 
of the nations whom they carried away from thence. 
34  Unto this day they do after the former manners. They fear not the 
Lord, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, 
or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded 
the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;  
 
35  with whom the Lord had made a covenant, and charged them, 
saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, 
nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:  
 
36  but the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with 
great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him 
shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice. 
37  And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the 
commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for 
evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. 
 
38  And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; 
 
neither shall ye fear other gods. 
39  But the Lord your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of 
 
the hand of all your enemies.
