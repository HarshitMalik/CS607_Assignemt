  1561    Isaiah 40 
5  ¶ Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of 
hosts: 
 
6  Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that 
which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be 
carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. 
 
7  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, 
shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the 
 
king of Babylon.  
8  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which 
thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and 
truth in my days.

The Lord’s Comforting Words to Zion 
1  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 
2  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her 
warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath 
 
received of the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. 
3  ¶ The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way 
of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.  
4  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be 
made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough 
 
places plain: 
 
5  and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it 
together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.  
 
6  ¶ The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is 
 
grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: 
 
7  the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the spirit of the 
 
Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. 
 
8  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God 
 
shall stand for ever.  
9  ¶ O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high 
mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice
