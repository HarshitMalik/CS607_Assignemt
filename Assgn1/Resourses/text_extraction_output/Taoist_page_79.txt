stopping in action.
Master  Cheng  said,  “The  human  mind  must  be  able  to
stop.  If  there  is  no  stopping  it,  then  it  follows  things
obediently, astray wherever it goes.”
Stopping has two meanings. One is abiding in a certain
state  without  moving  away  from  it.  The  other  is  cutting
something off and not returning to it. These two senses of
stopping are complementary means of entering the Way.
SEEING
People get up and work all day long, not knowing where
their  minds  go.  Some  people  may  consciously  keep
presence of mind, but most of them use forceful restraint.
Forceful restraint is damaging to the mind.
The  human  mind  is  very  lively;  the  spirit  should  be
peaceful.  Its  nature  should  be  developed  in  accordance
with  its  potential,  not  allowing  heedlessness,  or
forcefulness,  or  interruption.  These  are  the  minimum
requirements  for  what  could  be  called  guidelines  for
developing the mind.
What Confucius called “stopping at the highest good” is
Lao-tzu’s  “seeming  to  be  there”  and  Buddha’s  “seeing
independently.” The spirit of a human being is in the mind,
while the trigger of the mind is in the eyes. When the eyes
are  used  inwardly,  the  mind  is  accordingly  inside;  hence
the term “seeing independently.”
