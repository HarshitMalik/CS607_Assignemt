  2535    1 Timothy 6 
6 
1  Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters 
worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not 
blasphemed. 
2  And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, 
because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they 
 
are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. 
¶ These things teach and exhort. 
Godliness with Contentment 
3  If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, 
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is 
according to godliness; 
 
4  he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and 
strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil 
surmisings, 
5  perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the 
truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. 
 
6  But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
7  For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can 
carry nothing out. 
8  And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. 
9  But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into 
many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction 
and perdition. 
10  For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some 
 
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced 
themselves through with many sorrows. 
The Good Fight of Faith 
11  ¶ But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after 
 
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
