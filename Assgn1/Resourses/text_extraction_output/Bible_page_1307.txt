  1308    Psalms 79 
and their widows made no lamentation. 
65  Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, 
and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
66  And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: 
 
he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
67  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, 
and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
 
68  but chose the tribe of Judah, 
the mount Zion which he loved. 
69  And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, 
like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
70  He chose David also his servant, 
and took him from the sheepfolds: 
 
71  from following the ewes great with young 
he brought him to feed Jacob his people, 
and Israel his inheritance.  
72  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; 
 
and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

A Lament over the Destruction of Jerusalem 
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; 
 
thy holy temple have they defiled; 
 
they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.  
2  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the 
fowls of the heaven, 
the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
3  Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; 
 
and there was none to bury them. 
4  We are become a reproach to our neighbors, 
a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
