  865    2 Kings 13 
3  And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he 
delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the 
hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days. 
4  And Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto 
him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria 
 
oppressed them. 
5  (And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from 
under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in 
 
their tents, as beforetime. 
6  Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of 
Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there 
 
remained the grove also in Samaria.) 
7  Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, 
and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria 
 
had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing. 
8  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his 
might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the 
kings of Israel? 
 
9  And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in 
 
Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead. 
 
The Reign of Jehoash of Israel 
10  Â¶ In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began 
Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and 
reigned sixteen years. 
11  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed 
 
not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel 
sin: but he walked therein. 
 
12  And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might 
wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
13  And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: 
   
and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
