  563    Judges 4 
out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten 
 
thousand men after him. 
15  And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his 
host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted 
 
down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet. 
16  But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto 
Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the 
 
edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. 
 
17  ¶ Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of 
Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of 
 
Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
18  And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my 
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her 
 
into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 
19  And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; 
 
for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him 
drink, and covered him. 
20  Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall 
be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there 
any man here? that thou shalt say, No. 
 
21  Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer 
in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his 
temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and 
 
weary. So he died. 
22  And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, 
and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom 
thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay 
dead, and the nail was in his temples. 
23  ¶ So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the 
children of Israel. 
24  And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed 
against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin 
king of Canaan.
