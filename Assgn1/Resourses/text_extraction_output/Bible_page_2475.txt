  2476    2 Corinthians 13 
6  But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. 
7  Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear 
 
approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be 
as reprobates. 
8  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
9  For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also 
 
we wish, even your perfection. 
10  Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I 
should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath 
given me to edification, and not to destruction. 
Final Greetings 
11  ¶ Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of 
one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with 
 
you. 
12  Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
13  All the saints salute you. 
14  ¶ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the 
communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
