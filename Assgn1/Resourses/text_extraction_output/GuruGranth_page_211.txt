GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who forgets the Lord‟s Name, suffers in pain. Those who 
join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and dwell upon the Lord, find the 
Ocean  of virtue.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Those Gurmukhs whose hearts are filled with 
wisdom, hold the nine treasures, and the miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas in 
the palms of their hands.  || 1 ||   Those who know the Lord God as their Master, do 
not lack anything.  || 2 ||   Those who realize the Creator Lord, enjoy all peace and 
pleasure.  || 3 ||  Those whose inner homes are filled with the Lord‟s wealth — says 
Nanak, in their company, pain departs.  || 4 || 9 || 147 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  
Your pride is so great, but what about your origins? You cannot remain, no matter how 
much you try to hold on.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   That which is forbidden by the Vedas and 
the Saints — with that, you are in love. Like the gambler losing the game of chance, 
you are held in the power of sensory desires.  || 1 ||   The One who is All-powerful to 
empty out and fill up — you have no love for His Lotus Feet. O Nanak, I have been 
saved,  in  the  Saadh  Sangat,  the  Company  of  the  Holy.  I  have  been  blessed  by  the 
Treasure of Mercy.  || 2 || 10 || 148 ||   GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I am the slave of my 
Lord and Master. I eat whatever God gives me.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Such is my Lord and 
Master.  In  an  instant,  He  creates  and  embellishes.    ||  1  ||      I  do  that  work  which 
pleases my Lord and Master. I sing the songs of God‟s glory, and His wondrous play.  || 
2 ||   I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Prime Minister; beholding Him, my mind is 
comforted and consoled.  || 3 ||   The One Lord is my support, the One is my steady 
anchor. Servant Nanak is engaged in the Lord‟s work.  || 4 || 11 || 149 ||   GAUREE,  
FIFTH MEHL:  Is there anyone, who can shatter his ego, and turn his mind away from 
this sweet Maya?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Humanity is in spiritual ignorance; people see 
things that do not exist. The night is dark and gloomy; how will the morning dawn?  || 
1 ||   Wandering, wandering all around, I have grown weary; trying all sorts of things, I 
have  been  searching.  Says  Nanak,  He  has  shown  mercy  to  me;  I  have  found  the 
treasure of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.  || 2 || 12 || 150 ||   GAUREE,  
FIFTH MEHL:  He is the Wish-fulfilling Jewel, the Embodiment of Mercy.  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   The Supreme Lord God is Merciful to the meek; meditating in remembrance on Him, 
peace  is  obtained.    ||  1  ||      The  Wisdom  of  the  Undying  Primal  Being  is  beyond 
comprehension.  Hearing  His  Praises,  millions  of  sins  are  erased.    ||  2  ||      O  God, 
Treasure  of  Mercy,  please  bless  Nanak  with  Your  kindness,  that  he  may  repeat  the 
Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 || 13 || 151 ||   GAUREE POORBEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  O 
my mind, in the Sanctuary of God, peace is found. That day, when the Giver of life and 
peace is forgotten — that day passes uselessly.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have come as a 
guest  for  one  short  night,  and  yet  you  hope  to  live  for  many  ages.  Households, 
mansions and wealth — whatever is seen, is like the shade of a tree.  || 1 ||   My body, 
wealth, and all my gardens and property shall all pass away. You have forgotten your 
Lord and Master, the Great Giver.
