  1640    Jeremiah 13 
7  Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the 
place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was

Captivity Threatened for Judah’s Impenitence 
15  ¶ Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the Lord hath spoken. 
   
16  Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and 
before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye
