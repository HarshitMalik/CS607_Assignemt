BHAGAVAD GITA
astray from the right path. Faith ultimately confers divine knowledge, which removes ignorance
once and for all.
Mere intellectual knowledge does not lead to liberation. It cannot grant one supreme peace
and freedom. When one has achieved complete self-mastery and self-control, when one has intense
faith and devotion, then true knowledge dawns within and one attains liberation and freedom from
all weaknesses and sins.
The Lord concludes by emphasising that the soul that doubts goes to destruction. Without
faith in oneself, in the scriptures and in the words of the preceptor, one cannot make any headway
on the spiritual path. It is doubt that prevents one from engaging in spiritual Sadhana and realising
the highest knowledge and bliss. By following the instructions of the Guru and through sincere
service, one’s doubts are rent asunder and divine knowledge manifests itself within. Spiritual
progress then goes on at a rapid pace.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Imam vivaswate yogam proktavaan aham avyayam;
Vivaswaan manave praaha manur ikshwaakave’braveet.
The Blessed Lord said:
1. I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to
Ikshvaku.
Evam paramparaa praaptam imam raajarshayo viduh;
Sa kaaleneha mahataa yogo nashtah parantapa.
2. This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by a long
lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of foes)!
COMMENTARY: The royal sages were kings who at the same time possessed divine
knowledge. They learnt this Yoga.
Sa evaayam mayaa te’dya yogah proktah puraatanah;
Bhakto’si me sakhaa cheti rahasyam hyetad uttamam.
3. That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for, thou art My devotee
and friend; it is the supreme secret.
COMMENTARY: This ancient Yoga consists of profound and subtle teachings. Hence it
is the supreme secret which the Lord reveals to Arjuna.

Aparam bhavato janma param janma vivaswatah;
