  2348    Acts 15 
21  And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught 
many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, 
22  confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to 
continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation 
enter into the kingdom of God. 
23  And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had 
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom 
they believed. 
The Return to Antioch in Syria 
24  Â¶ And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to 
Pamphylia. 
25  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down 
into Attalia: 
 
26  and thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been 
recommended to the grace of God for the work which they 
fulfilled. 
27  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, 
they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had 
opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
28  And there they abode long time with the disciples.

The Council at Jerusalem 
1  And certain men which came down from Judea taught the 
brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of 
Moses, ye cannot be saved. 
2  When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and 
disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, 
and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the 
apostles and elders about this question.
