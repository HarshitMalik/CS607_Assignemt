  1017    2 Chronicles 23 
12  And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and 
 
Athaliah reigned over the land. 
23 
1  And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took 
the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael 
the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah 
the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant 
with him. 
2  And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all 
the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they 
came to Jerusalem. 
3  And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the 
house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall 
reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of David.  
4  This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the 
 
sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the 
doors; 
 
5  and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the 
 
gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of 
 
the house of the Lord. 
6  But let none come into the house of the Lord, save the priests, and 
they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: 
   
but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord. 
7  And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man 
with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the 
 
house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he 
 
cometh in, and when he goeth out. 
8  ¶ So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that 
Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men 
that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out 
on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
