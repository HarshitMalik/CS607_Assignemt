  550    Joshua 24 
3  And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, 
and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his 
seed, and gave him Isaac.  
4  And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount 
 
Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.  
 
5  I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that 
which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. 
 
6  And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; 
   
and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and 
horsemen unto the Red sea. 
7  And when they cried unto the Lord, he put darkness between you 
and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered 
them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye 
   
dwelt in the wilderness a long season. 
8  And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on 
the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them 
   
into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed 
 
them from before you.  
9  Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred 
against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse 
you: 
 
10  but I would not hearken unto Balaam, therefore he blessed you 
still: so I delivered you out of his hand. 
 
11  And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of 
 
Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and 
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, 
and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. 
 
12  And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from 
before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy 
 
sword, nor with thy bow. 
13  And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities 
which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and 
 
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
