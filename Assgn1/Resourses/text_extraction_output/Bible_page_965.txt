  966    1 Chronicles 27 
23  But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and 
under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to 
 
the stars of the heavens.  
24  Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, 
because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the 
 
number put in the account of the Chronicles of king David. 
25  ¶ And over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and 
 
over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, 
and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: 
 
26  and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the 
ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
 
27  and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase 
 
of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: 
 
28  and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the low 
plains was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was 
 
Joash: 
 
29  and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: 
 
and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of 
Adlai: 
 
30  over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was 
 
Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
 
31  and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers 
of the substance which was king David’s. 
32  ¶ Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a 
scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons: 
   
33  and Ahithophel was the king’s counselor: and Hushai the Archite 
 
was the king’s companion: 
 
34  and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and 
Abiathar: and the general of the king’s army was Joab.
