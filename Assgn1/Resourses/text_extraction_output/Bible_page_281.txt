  282    Leviticus 22 
sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish 
 
therein. 
22  Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or 
scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, nor make an 
offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord. 
23  Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or 
lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; 
 
but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 
24  Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed, 
or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your 
 
land. 
25  Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God 
of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes 
 
be in them: they shall not be accepted for you. 
 
26  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
27  When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall 
be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and 
 
thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto 
the Lord. 
28  And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both 
in one day. 
29  And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, 
offer it at your own will. 
30  On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until 
 
the morrow: I am the Lord. 
 
31  ¶ Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am 
 
the Lord. 
32  Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed 
 
among the children of Israel: I am the Lord which hallow you, 
 
33  that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the 
 
Lord.
