  1249    Psalms 39 
and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
12  They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; 
 
and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, 
and imagine deceits all the day long. 
13  But I, as a deaf man, heard not; 
 
and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
14  Thus I was as a man that heareth not, 
and in whose mouth are no reproofs. 
15  For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: 
 
thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
16  For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: 
 
when my foot slippeth, 
they magnify themselves against me. 
17  For I am ready to halt, 
and my sorrow is continually before me. 
18  For I will declare mine iniquity; 
 
I will be sorry for my sin. 
19  But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: 
 
and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
20  They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; 
 
because I follow the thing that good is. 
21  Forsake me not, O Lord: 
 
O my God, be not far from me. 
22  Make haste to help me, 
O Lord my salvation.

1  I said, I will take heed to my ways, 
that I sin not with my tongue:
