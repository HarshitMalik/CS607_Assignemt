  778    1 Kings 7 
12  And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed 
stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the 
house of the Lord, and for the porch of the house. 
Solomon Employs Hiram of Tyre 
13  ¶ And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
14  He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a 
man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and 
 
understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he 
came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
15  ¶ For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and 
 
a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. 
16  And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of 
the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the 
 
height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 
 
17  and nets of checkerwork, and wreaths of chainwork, for the 
chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one 
 
chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 
18  And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one 
network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with 
pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. 
 
19  And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily 
work in the porch, four cubits. 
20  And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, 
over against the belly which was by the network: and the 
 
pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the 
other chapiter. 
21  And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up 
 
the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin [he shall 
establish]: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof 
 
Boaz [in it is strength]. 
22  And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of 
 
the pillars finished.
