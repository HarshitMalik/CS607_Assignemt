  1474    Ecclesiastes 9 
13  but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his 
days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. 
 
14  ¶ There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just 
 
men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; 
 
again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the 
work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. 
 
15  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing 
under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that 
 
shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God 
giveth him under the sun. 
16  ¶ When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the 
business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither 
 
day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
 
17  then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the 
work that is done under the sun: because though a man labor to 
 
seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man 
   
think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. 
9 
1  For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the 
righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no 
 
man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. 
2  All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to 
 
the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to 
   
him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, 
 
so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. 
 
3  This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that 
there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is 
 
full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after 
that they go to the dead. 
4  For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living 
 
dog is better than a dead lion.
