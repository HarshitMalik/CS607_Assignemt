  756    2 Samuel 24 
15  ¶ So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even 
to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even 
 
to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 
16  And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to 
destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel 
that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And 
 
the angel of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the 
Jebusite. 
17  And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote 
the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: 
 
but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, 
 
be against me, and against my father’s house. 
18  ¶ And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear 
an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the 
Jebusite. 
19  And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the Lord 
commanded. 
20  And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on 
toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the 
 
king on his face upon the ground. 
21  And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his 
servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to 
 
build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from 
the people. 
22  And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer 
up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt 
 
sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the 
oxen for wood. 
23  All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And 
Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee. 
24  And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of 
 
thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord 
 
my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the 
threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
