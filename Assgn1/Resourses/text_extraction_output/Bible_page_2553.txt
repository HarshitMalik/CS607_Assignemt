  2554    Hebrews 4 
9  when your fathers tempted me, proved me, 
and saw my works forty years. 
10  Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, 
and said, They do always err in their heart; 
 
and they have not known my ways. 
11  So I sware in my wrath, 
They shall not enter into my rest.  
12  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of 
unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
13  But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of 
 
you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
14  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of 
our confidence steadfast unto the end; 
 
15  while it is said, 
Today if ye will hear his voice, 
harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  
16  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that 
 
came out of Egypt by Moses. 
17  But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them 
 
that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
 
18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but 
to them that believed not?  
 
19  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into 
his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. 
2  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the 
 
word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in 
them that heard it. 
3  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, 
As I have sworn in my wrath, 
if they shall enter into my rest:
