  751    2 Samuel 23 
44  Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, 
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: 
 
a people which I knew not shall serve me. 
45  Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: 
 
as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. 
46  Strangers shall fade away, 
and they shall be afraid out of their close places. 
47  The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; 
   
and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 
48  It is God that avengeth me, 
and that bringeth down the people under me, 
49  and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: 
 
thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against 
me: 
 
thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
50  Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the 
heathen, 
and I will sing praises unto thy name.  
51  He is the tower of salvation for his king: 
 
and showeth mercy to his anointed, 
unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

the anointed of the God of Jacob, 
and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 
2  The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, 
and his word was in my tongue. 
3  The God of Israel said, 
the Rock of Israel spake to me,
