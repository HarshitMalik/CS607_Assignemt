THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
49. Be not afraid nor bewildered on seeing such a terrible form of Mine as this; with thy fear
entirely dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Ityarjunam vaasudevastathoktwaa
Swakam roopam darshayaamaasa bhooyah;
Aashwaasayaamaasa cha bheetamenam
Bhootwaa punah saumyavapurmahaatmaa.
Sanjaya said:
50. Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form; and the great soul
(Krishna), assuming His gentle form, consoled him who was terrified (Arjuna).
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Drishtwedam maanusham roopam tava saumyam janaardana;
Idaaneemasmi samvrittah sachetaah prakritim gatah.
Arjuna said:
51. Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and restored
to my own nature!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Sudurdarshamidam roopam drishtavaanasi yanmama;
Devaa apyasya roopasya nityam darshanakaangkshinah.
The Blessed Lord said:
52. Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are
ever longing to behold it.
Naa ham vedairna tapasaa na daanena na chejyayaa;
Shakya evamvidho drashtum drishtavaanasi maam yathaa.
53. Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice, can I be seen in this
form as thou hast seen Me (so easily).
Bhaktyaa twananyayaa shakyam aham evamvidhoâ€™rjuna;
Jnaatum drashtum cha tattwena praveshtum cha parantapa.
54. But by single-minded devotion can I, of this form, be known and seen in reality and also
entered into, O Arjuna!
Matkarmakrinmatparamo madbhaktah sangavarjitah;
Nirvairah sarvabhooteshu yah sa maameti paandava.
