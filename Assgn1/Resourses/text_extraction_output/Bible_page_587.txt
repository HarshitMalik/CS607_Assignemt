  588    Judges 13 
13 
The Birth of Samson 
1  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; 
 
and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty 
years. 
2  ¶ And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the 
Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and 
 
bare not. 
3  And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said 
unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou 
 
shalt conceive, and bear a son. 
4  Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong 
drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 
 
5  for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come 
 
on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the 
 
womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the 
 
Philistines. 
6  Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God 
came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an 
angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, 
 
neither told he me his name: 
 
7  but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; 
 
and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean 
thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the 
 
day of his death. 
8  ¶ Then Manoah entreated the Lord, and said, O my Lord, let the 
man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach 
us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. 
9  And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God 
 
came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her 
 
husband was not with her.
