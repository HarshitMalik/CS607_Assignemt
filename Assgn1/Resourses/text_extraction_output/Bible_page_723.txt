  724    2 Samuel 14 
29  And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had 
commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him 
up upon his mule, and fled. 
30  ¶ And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came 
to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there 
is not one of them left. 
31  Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; 
 
and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 
32  And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and 
said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men 
the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of 
   
Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his 
sister Tamar. 
33  Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, 
to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. 
 
34  ¶ But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted 
up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by 
the way of the hillside behind him. 
35  And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as 
 
thy servant said, so it is. 
36  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, 
that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and 
wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. 
 
37  ¶ But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king 
of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. 
38  So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
39  And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he 
 
was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

Joab’s Scheme for Absalom’s Return 
1  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was 
toward Absalom.
