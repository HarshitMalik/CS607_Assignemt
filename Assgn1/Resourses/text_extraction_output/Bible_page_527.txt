5  And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. 
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at 
the uttermost part of Jordan: 
 
6  and the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the 
north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of 
 
Bohan the son of Reuben: 
 
7  and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and 
so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to 
Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border 
 
passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out 
thereof were at En-rogel: 
 
8  and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto 
the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border 
   
went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of 
Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants 
northward: 
 
9  and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the 
fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of 
mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is 
 
Kirjath-jearim: 
 
10  and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, 
and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, 
on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on 
to Timnah: 
 
11  and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the 
 
border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, 
and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at 
 
the sea. 
12  And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This 
is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their 
families.
