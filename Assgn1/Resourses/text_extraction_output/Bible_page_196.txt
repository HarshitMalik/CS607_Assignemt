  197    Exodus 30 
30 
The Altar of Incense 
1  And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim 
 
wood shalt thou make it. 
2  A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; 
 
foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the 
   
horns thereof shall be of the same. 
3  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the 
sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt 
 
make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
4  And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, 
by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make 
it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
 
5  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them 
with gold. 
6  And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the 
testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I 
will meet with thee. 
7  And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when 
 
he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 
8  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense 
upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your 
generations. 
9  Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor 
meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 
 
10  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a 
year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements; once in the 
 
year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your 
generations: it is most holy unto the Lord.
