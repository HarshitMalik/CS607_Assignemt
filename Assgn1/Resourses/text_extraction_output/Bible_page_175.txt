  176    Exodus 22 
8  If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be 
brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto 
his neighbor’s goods. 
9  ¶ For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, 
for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another 
challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before 
the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay 
 
double unto his neighbor. 
10  ¶ If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or 
any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man 
 
seeing it: 
 
11  then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath 
not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; and the owner of it 
 
shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good. 
12  And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the 
owner thereof. 
13  If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall 
not make good that which was torn. 
14  ¶ And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, 
the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. 
15  But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be 
 
a hired thing, it came for his hire.
