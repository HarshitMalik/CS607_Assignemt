  1964    Nahum 3 
6  The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be 
dissolved. 
7  And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and 
her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, taboring upon 
their breasts.

young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the 
 
voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

departeth not; 
 
2  the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and 
of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots. 
3  The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering 
spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of 
 
carcasses; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon 
   
their corpses:
