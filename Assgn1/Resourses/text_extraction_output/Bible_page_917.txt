The Cities of the Levites 
54  ¶ Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in 
their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: 
 
for theirs was the lot. 
55  And they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the suburbs 
thereof round about it. 
56  But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb 
the son of Jephunneh. 
57  And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah, namely, 
Hebron, the city of refuge, and Libnah with her suburbs, and Jattir, 
and Eshtemoa, with their suburbs, 
58  and Hilen with her suburbs, Debir with her suburbs, 
59  and Ashan with her suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with her suburbs:
