  418    Deuteronomy 4 
20  But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the 
iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of 
inheritance, as ye are this day. 
21  Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and 
sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in 
unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an 
inheritance:  
 
22  but I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall 
 
go over, and possess that good land. 
23  Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord 
your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, 
or the likeness of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath 
forbidden thee. 
24  For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. 
25  ¶ When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye 
shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, 
and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do 
evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger; 
 
26  I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall 
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan 
to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly 
 
be destroyed. 
27  And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be 
left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall 
lead you. 
28  And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and 
stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
29  But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt 
find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.  
30  When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon 
thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and 
shalt be obedient unto his voice; 
 
31  (for the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, 
 
neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which 
he sware unto them.
