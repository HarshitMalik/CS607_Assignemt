aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines 
 
went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. 
13  And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the 
valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced 
 
to see it. 
14  And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and 
stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood 
 
of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord. 
15  And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that 
was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the 
great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings 
 
and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord. 
16  And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned 
to Ekron the same day. 
17  ¶ And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned 
for a trespass offering unto the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza 
 
one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 
 
18  and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the 
Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of 
country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set 
down the ark of the Lord: which stone remaineth unto this day in 
 
the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite. 
19  ¶ And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked 
into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty 
thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, 
 
because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great 
slaughter. 
20  And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this 
holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go up from us? 
   
21  And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, 
saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; 
 
come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
