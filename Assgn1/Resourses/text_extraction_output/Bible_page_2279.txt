  2280    John 12 
The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem 
12  ¶ On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when 
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
13  took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, 
Hosanna:  
 
Blessed is the King of Israel 
that cometh in the name of the Lord.  
14  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is 
 
written, 
15  Fear not, daughter of Zion: 
 
behold, thy King cometh, 
sitting on an ass’s colt.  
16  These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when 
 
Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were 
written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
17  The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out 
of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
18  For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he 
had done this miracle. 
19  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye 
prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 
 
Some Greeks Seek Jesus 
20  ¶ And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to 
worship at the feast: 
 
21  the same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of 
Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
22  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip 
 
tell Jesus. 
23  And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son 
of man should be glorified.
