BHAIRAO,  THE WORD OF THE DEVOTEES,  KABEER JEE,  FIRST HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The Name of the Lord — this alone is my wealth. I do not tie it up to hide it, nor do I 
sell it to make my living.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Name is my crop, and the Name is my 
field.  As  Your  humble  servant,  I  perform  devotional  worship  to  You;  I  seek  Your 
Sanctuary.  || 1 ||   The Name is Maya and wealth for me; the Name is my capital. I do 
not forsake You; I do not know any other at all.  || 2 ||   The Name is my family, the 
Name is my brother. The Name is my companion, who will help me in the end.  || 3 ||   
One whom the Lord keeps detached from Maya — says Kabeer, I am his slave.  || 4 || 
1 ||   Naked we come, and naked we go.
