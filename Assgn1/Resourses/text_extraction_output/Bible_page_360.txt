  361    Numbers 21 
21 
The Canaanites Attack Israel 
1  And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, 
heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought 
 
against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. 
2  And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt 
indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy 
their cities. 
3  And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up 
the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: 
   
and he called the name of the place Hormah [utter destruction]. 
The Fiery Serpents 
4  Â¶ And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, 
to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much 
 
discouraged because of the way. 
5  And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore 
have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for 
 
there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth 
 
this light bread. 
6  And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit 
the people; and much people of Israel died. 
 
7  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for 
we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the 
 
Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed 
for the people. 
8  And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set 
it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is 
 
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. 
9  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it 
 
came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld 
the serpent of brass, he lived.
