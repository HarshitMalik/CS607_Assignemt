  2412    Romans 11 
7  ¶ What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; 
   
but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded 
8  (according as it is written, 
God hath given them the spirit of slumber, 
eyes that they should not see, 
and ears that they should not hear;) 
 
unto this day.  
9  And David saith, 
Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, 
and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: 
 
10  let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, 
and bow down their back alway.  
The Salvation of the Gentiles 
11  ¶ I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: 
   
but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for 
to provoke them to jealousy. 
12  Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the 
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more 
 
their fulness? 
 
13  ¶ For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the 
Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 
 
14  if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my 
flesh, and might save some of them. 
15  For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, 
what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 
 
16  For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be 
 
holy, so are the branches. 
17  ¶ And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild 
olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of 
the root and fatness of the olive tree; 
 
18  boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not 
the root, but the root thee.
