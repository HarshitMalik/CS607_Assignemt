BHAGAVAD GITA
42. Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to
obtain in this world.
Tatra tam buddhisamyogam labhate paurvadehikam;
Yatate cha tato bhooyah samsiddhau kurunandana.
43. There he comes in touch with the knowledge acquired in his former body and strives
more than before for perfection, O Arjuna!
Poorvaabhyaasena tenaiva hriyate hyavasho’pi sah;
Jijnaasurapi yogasya shabdabrahmaativartate.
44. By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely
wishes to know Yoga transcends the Brahmic word.
COMMENTARY: One who had fallen from Yoga is carried to the goal (which he intended
to reach in his previous birth), by the force of the impressions of his past Yogic practices, though he
may be unconscious of it and may not be willing to adopt the course of Yogic discipline due to the
force of some evil Karma.
Prayatnaadyatamaanastu yogee samshuddhakilbishah;
Anekajanmasamsiddhas tato yaati paraam gatim.
45. But, the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually
through many births, reaches the highest goal.
Tapaswibhyo’dhiko yogee jnaanibhyo’pi mato’dhikah;
Karmibhyashchaadhiko yogee tasmaad yogee bhavaarjuna.
46. The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge
(obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore, be thou a
Yogi, O Arjuna!
Yoginaamapi sarveshaam madgatenaantaraatmanaa;
Shraddhaavaan bhajate yo maam sa me yuktatamo matah.
47. And among all the Yogis, he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me,
worships Me, he is deemed by Me to be the most devout.
