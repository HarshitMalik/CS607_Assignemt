  637    1 Samuel 9 
7  Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we 
bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not 
 
a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
   
8  And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here 
at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the 
 
man of God, to tell us our way. 
9  (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he 
spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a 
 
Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
10  Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they 
 
went unto the city where the man of God was. 
11  ¶ And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young 
maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer 
here? 
 
12  And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: 
   
make haste now, for he came today to the city; for there is a sacrifice 
 
of the people today in the high place: 
 
13  as soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, 
before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat 
 
until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterward 
 
they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this 
 
time ye shall find him. 
14  And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the 
 
city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high 
place. 
15  ¶ Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, 
saying, 
16  Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of 
Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people 
Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the 
Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is 
 
come unto me. 
17  And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, Behold the 
man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.
