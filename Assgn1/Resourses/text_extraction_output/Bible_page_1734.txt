  1735    Jeremiah 52 
the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And 
this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 
60  So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon 
Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. 
61  And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and 
shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 
 
62  then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to 
cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but 
that it shall be desolate for ever. 
63  And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, 
that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of 
Euphrates: 
 
64  and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from 
the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. 
 
¶ Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. 
52 
The Reign of Zedekiah 
1  Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, 
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name 
was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2  And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to 
all that Jehoiakim had done. 
3  For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and 
Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah 
rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
The Fall of Jerusalem 
4  ¶ And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth 
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of 
Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched 
against it, and built forts against it round about.
