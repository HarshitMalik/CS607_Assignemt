sweet savor: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the 
 
fourth part of a hin. 
14  And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, 
until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your 
God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all 
 
your dwellings.
