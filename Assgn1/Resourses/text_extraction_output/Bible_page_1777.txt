  1778    Ezekiel 14 
5  that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they 
are all estranged from me through their idols. 
6  ¶ Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; 
 
Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your 
 
faces from all your abominations. 
7  For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that 
sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth 
up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his 
iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him 
concerning me; I the Lord will answer him by myself: 
   
8  and I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign 
and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; 
 
and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
9  And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the 
Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand 
upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
10  And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the 
 
punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him 
that seeketh unto him; 
 
11  that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be 
polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may 
 
be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord God. 
The Justice of God’s Punishment of Jerusalem 
12  ¶ The word of the Lord came again to me, saying, 
13  Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing 
grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will 
break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, 
and will cut off man and beast from it: 
 
14  though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they 
should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the 
Lord God.
