  1637    Jeremiah 12 
16  The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly 
fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, 
 
and the branches of it are broken. 
17  For the Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil 
against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of 
Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to 
anger in offering incense unto Baal.

thou showedest me their doings. 
19  But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I

destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from 
the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. 
20  But, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins 
and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee 
 
have I revealed my cause. 
21  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth, that seek 
thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that thou 
die not by our hand: 
 
22  therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: 
 
the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their 
 
daughters shall die by famine: 
 
23  and there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon 
 
the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
