  987    2 Chronicles 7 
10  And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent 
the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the 
goodness that the Lord had showed unto David, and to Solomon, 
and to Israel his people. 
The Lord’s Covenant with Solomon 
11  ¶ Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king’s 
house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house 
 
of the Lord, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. 
12  And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I 
have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a 
house of sacrifice. 
13  If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the 
locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 
 
14  if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble 
themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked 
ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and 
 
will heal their land. 
15  Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer 
that is made in this place. 
16  For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name 
may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there 
 
perpetually. 
17  And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father 
walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and 
shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 
 
18  then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have 
covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee 
a man to be ruler in Israel.  
19  ¶ But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my 
commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and 
serve other gods, and worship them; 
 
20  then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have 
given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name,
