  1549    Isaiah 33 
8  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken 
 
the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 
9  The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and 
 
hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel 
   
shake off their fruits. 
10  ¶ Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I be exalted; now will I 
   
lift up myself. 
11  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as 
 
fire, shall devour you. 
12  And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up 
 
shall they be burned in the fire. 
13  ¶ Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, 
 
acknowledge my might. 
14  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the 
 
hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? 
 
who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 
 
15  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that 
 
despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from 
holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and 
shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 
 
16  he shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the munitions of 
 
rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. 
   
17  ¶ Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty: they shall behold the 
 
land that is very far off. 
18  Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the 
 
receiver? where is he that counted the towers? 
   
19  Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than 
thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not 
 
understand. 
20  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see 
 
Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken 
down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither 
 
shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
