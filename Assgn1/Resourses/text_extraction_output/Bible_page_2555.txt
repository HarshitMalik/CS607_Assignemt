  2556    Hebrews 5 
16  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may 
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. 
5 
1  For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men 
in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and 
sacrifices for sins: 
 
2  who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are 
out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 
 
3  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for 
himself, to offer for sins.  
4  And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of 
God, as was Aaron.  
5  ¶ So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but 
 
he that said unto him, 
Thou art my Son, 
today have I begotten thee.  
6  As he saith also in another place, 
Thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of Melchizedek.  
7  ¶ Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and 
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able 
to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 
 
8  though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things 
which he suffered; 
 
9  and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation 
unto all them that obey him; 
 
10  called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. 
The Danger of Slothfulness and Apostasy 
11  ¶ Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, 
seeing ye are dull of hearing.
