  846    2 Kings 6 
6  And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the 
 
place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron 
 
did swim. 
7  Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and 
took it. 
Elisha and the Syrians 
8  ¶ Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel 
with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. 
9  And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware 
that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come 
 
down. 
10  And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told 
him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor 
twice. 
11  ¶ Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this 
thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not 
 
show me which of us is for the king of Israel? 
 
12  And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the 
 
prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that 
thou speakest in thy bedchamber. 
13  And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. 
And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
14  Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and 
 
they came by night, and compassed the city about. 
15  ¶ And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and 
gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and 
chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall 
 
we do? 
 
16  And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than 
 
they that be with them. 
17  And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that 
he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and
