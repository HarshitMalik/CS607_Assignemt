  2207    Luke 15 
The Cost of Discipleship 
25  ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and 
 
said unto them, 
26  If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and 
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life 
also, he cannot be my disciple.  
27  And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot 
be my disciple.  
28  For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, 
and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? 
 
29  Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to 
finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, 
30  saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
31  Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not 
down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to 
meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 
 
32  Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an 
ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. 
33  So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he 
hath, he cannot be my disciple. 
Tasteless Salt 
34  ¶ Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it 
 
be seasoned? 
 
35  It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it 
 
out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep

him.
