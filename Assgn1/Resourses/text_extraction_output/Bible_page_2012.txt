The Visit of the Wise Men 
1  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of 
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to 
Jerusalem, 
2  saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen 
 
his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
3  When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and 
all Jerusalem with him. 
4  And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the 
people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be 
born. 
5  And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is 
 
written by the prophet, 
6  And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, 
art not the least among the princes of Judah: 
 
for out of thee shall come a Governor, 
that shall rule my people Israel.  
7  Â¶ Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired 
of them diligently what time the star appeared. 
8  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently 
for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word 
 
again, that I may come and worship him also. 
9  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, 
 
which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood 
over where the young child was. 
10  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 
11  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child 
with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and 
 
when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him 
gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 
 
12  And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to 
Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
