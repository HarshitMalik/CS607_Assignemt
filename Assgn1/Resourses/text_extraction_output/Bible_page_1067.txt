  1068    Ezra 7 
14  Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counselors, 
to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of 
thy God which is in thine hand; 
 
15  and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors 
have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in 
Jerusalem, 
16  and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of 
Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, 
offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: 
 
17  that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, 
lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and 
offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in 
Jerusalem. 
18  And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do 
with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your 
God. 
19  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of 
thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 
20  And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, 
which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the 
king’s treasure house. 
21  ¶ And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the 
treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the 
priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of 
you, it be done speedily, 
22  unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of 
wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of 
oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 
23  Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be 
diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should 
 
there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
 
24  Also we certify you, that, touching any of the priests and Levites, 
singers, porters, Nethinim, or ministers of this house of God, it 
shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
