measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty 
thousand baths of oil. 
11  ¶ Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent 
to Solomon, Because the Lord hath loved his people, he hath 
made thee king over them. 
12  Huram said moreover, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, that 
made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise 
son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build a 
house for the Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 
13  ¶ And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with 
understanding, of Huram my father’s, 
14  the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a 
man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, 
in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in 
crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every 
 
device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with 
the cunning men of my lord David thy father. 
15  Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, 
which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 
 
16  and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: 
 
and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt 
 
carry it up to Jerusalem. 
17  ¶ And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of 
Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had 
numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty 
 
thousand and three thousand and six hundred. 
18  And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of 
burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and 
three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people awork.
