  1431    Proverbs 16 
12  It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: 
 
for the throne is established by righteousness. 
13  Righteous lips are the delight of kings; 
 
and they love him that speaketh right. 
14  The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: 
 
but a wise man will pacify it. 
15  In the light of the kingâ€™s countenance is life; 
 
and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. 
16  How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! 
 
and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! 
 
17  The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: 
 
he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 
18  Pride goeth before destruction, 
and a haughty spirit before a fall. 
19  Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, 
than to divide the spoil with the proud. 
20  He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: 
 
and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he. 
21  The wise in heart shall be called prudent: 
 
and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 
22  Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: 
 
but the instruction of fools is folly. 
23  The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, 
and addeth learning to his lips. 
24  Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, 
sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 
25  There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; 
 
but the end thereof are the ways of death.  
26  He that laboreth, laboreth for himself; 
 
for his mouth craveth it of him. 
27  An ungodly man diggeth up evil: 
 
and in his lips there is as a burning fire. 
28  A froward man soweth strife: 
 
and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 
29  A violent man enticeth his neighbor,
