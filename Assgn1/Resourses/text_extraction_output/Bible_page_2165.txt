  2166    Luke 5 
Jesus Heals Simon’s Mother-in-Law 
38  ¶ And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s 
house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and 
 
they besought him for her. 
39  And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and 
   
immediately she arose and ministered unto them. 
Jesus Heals Many at Evening 
40  ¶ Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with 
divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on 
 
every one of them, and healed them. 
41  And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art 
Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to 
speak: for they knew that he was Christ. 
 
Jesus Departs on a Preaching Tour 
42  ¶ And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: 
 
and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, 
that he should not depart from them. 
43  And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other 
cities also: for therefore am I sent. 
 
44  And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

The Great Catch of Fish 
1  And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear 
the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 
2  and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were 
 
gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
