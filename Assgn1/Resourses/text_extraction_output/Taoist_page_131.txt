When  the  energy  ocean  is  pure,  wrong  desires  cannot
affect it, so vitality is complete and the belly is full.
So  clarify  mind  as  you  would  clarify  water;  nurture
nonvolatile energy as you would nurture an infant.
When  nonvolatile  energy  blossoms,  the  spirit  is
effective.  When  the  spirit  is  effective,  nonvolatile  energy
transmutes.
This  is  effected  by  clarity  and  purity.  If  you  practice
conscious,  deliberate  exercises,  these  are  limited
techniques.  If  you  practice  the  principle  of  mindless
noncontrivance, this is unlimited clear emptiness.
NONCONTRIVANCE
Noncontrivance means not musing or mulling.
Though you may act in the midst of love, desire, anger,
accumulation, gain, and loss, be always uncontrived.
Even when involved in things, be always unconcerned.
If  you  concentrate  totally,  moreover,  clarify  your  mind
and purify your will, nourish your energy and make your
spirit complete, you will drift into the land of freedom and
enter the village of nothing-whatsoever.
MINDLESSNESS
Mindlessness, or no mind, does not mean being mindless
like cats or dogs or bugs.
It means striving to keep the mind in the realm of clear
purity, and having no warped mind.
