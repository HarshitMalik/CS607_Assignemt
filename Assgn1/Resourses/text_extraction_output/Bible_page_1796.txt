  1797    Ezekiel 21 
49  Then said I, Ah Lord God! they say of me, Doth he not speak 
 
parables? 
 
21 
The Lord’s Sharpened Sword 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word 
toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
3  and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am 
 
against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and 
will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. 
4  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the 
wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against 
all flesh from the south to the north: 
 
5  that all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my 
sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. 
 
6  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and 
 
with bitterness sigh before their eyes. 
7  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? 
 
that thou shalt answer, For the tidings, because it cometh: and 
 
every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit 
shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, 
 
and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord God. 
8  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying, 
9  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, A sword, 
 
a sword is sharpened, and also furbished: 
 
10  it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may 
 
glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my 
   
son, as every tree. 
11  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this 
 
sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of 
the slayer.
