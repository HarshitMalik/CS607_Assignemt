  68    Genesis 29 
that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, 
and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 
11  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
12  And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he 
was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father. 
 
13  ¶ And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his 
sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed 
him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these 
things. 
14  And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And 
he abode with him the space of a month. 
15  ¶ And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, 
shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall 
 
thy wages be? 
 
16  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and 
 
the name of the younger was Rachel. 
17  Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored. 
 
18  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for 
 
Rachel thy younger daughter. 
19  And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should 
give her to another man: abide with me. 
 
20  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto 
 
him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 
21  ¶ And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are 
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 
22  And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a 
feast. 
23  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, 
and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
 
24  And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for a 
handmaid. 
25  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and 
 
he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I 
 
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
