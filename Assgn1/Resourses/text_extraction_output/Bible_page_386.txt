The Law concerning Vows 
1  And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the 
children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath 
commanded. 
2  If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his 
soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according 
 
to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.  
3  If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a 
bond, being in her father’s house in her youth; 
 
4  and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath 
bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all 
 
her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound 
her soul shall stand. 
5  But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, not any of 
her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall 
stand; and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father 
 
disallowed her. 
6  And if she had at all a husband, when she vowed, or uttered aught 
out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
 
7  and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that 
he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith 
 
she bound her soul shall stand. 
8  But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it, then 
he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she 
uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect; 
 
and the Lord shall forgive her. 
9  But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith 
they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. 
10  And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a 
bond with an oath;
