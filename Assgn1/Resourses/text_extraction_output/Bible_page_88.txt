  89    Genesis 37 
37 
Joseph Sold into Egypt 
1  And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in 
the land of Canaan. 
2  These are the generations of Jacob. 
¶ Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his 
brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the 
 
sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his 
 
father their evil report. 
3  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was 
the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors. 
 
4  And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than 
all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably 
unto him. 
5  ¶ And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and 
 
they hated him yet the more. 
6  And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have 
dreamed: 
 
7  for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf 
arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood 
 
round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
8  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or 
 
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet 
 
the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
9  And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and 
said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun 
 
and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
10  And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father 
 
rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast 
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to 
 
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 
 
11  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 
 
12  ¶ And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
