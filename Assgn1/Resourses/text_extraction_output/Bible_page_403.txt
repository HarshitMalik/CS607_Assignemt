The Law concerning the Marriage of Heiresses 
1  And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the 
son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of 
Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, 
the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 
 
2  and they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for 
an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was 
 
commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad 
our brother unto his daughters.  
3  And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the 
children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the 
inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the 
tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot 
 
of our inheritance. 
4  And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall 
their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe 
whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken 
 
away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. 
5  Â¶ And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the 
word of the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said 
well. 
6  This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the 
daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they 
think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they 
 
marry. 
7  So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from 
tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep 
 
himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
8  And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of 
the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the 
tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man 
the inheritance of his fathers.
