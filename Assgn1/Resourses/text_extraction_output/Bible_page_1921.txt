  1922    Hosea 14 
8  Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have 
 
heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is 
 
thy fruit found. 
9  Â¶ Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and 
 
he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the 
 
just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
