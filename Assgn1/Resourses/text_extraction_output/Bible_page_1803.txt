  1804    Ezekiel 23 
22  ¶ Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will 
 
raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, 
and I will bring them against thee on every side; 
 
23  the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, 
and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, 
 
captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding 
upon horses. 
24  And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and 
wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee 
buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment 
 
before them, and they shall judge thee according to their 
judgments. 
25  And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal 
furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; 
   
and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons 
 
and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 
 
26  They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair 
jewels. 
27  Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy 
whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not 
 
lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 
28  For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will deliver thee into the 
 
hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom 
thy mind is alienated: 
 
29  and they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy 
labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of 
 
thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy 
whoredoms. 
30  I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring 
after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols. 
31  Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her 
 
cup into thine hand. 
32  Thus saith the Lord God; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep 
 
and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it 
   
containeth much.
