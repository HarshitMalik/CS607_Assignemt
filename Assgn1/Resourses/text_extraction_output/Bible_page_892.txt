  893    2 Kings 23 
23 
1  And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of 
Judah and of Jerusalem. 
2  And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men 
of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the 
priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: 
 
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant 
which was found in the house of the Lord. 
3  And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the 
Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments and 
his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, 
to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this 
book. And all the people stood to the covenant.

4  ¶ And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests 
of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out 
of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, 
and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned 
 
them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the 
ashes of them unto Beth-el. 
5  And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah 
had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of 
Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that 
 
burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the 
planets, and to all the host of heaven. 
6  And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord, without 
Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook 
Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder 
thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.  
7  And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the 
house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
