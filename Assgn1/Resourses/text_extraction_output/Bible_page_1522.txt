  1523    Isaiah 19 
4  ¶ For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will 
consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like 
a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. 
5  For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is 
ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning 
hooks, and take away and cut down the branches. 
6  They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to 
the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and 
 
all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. 
7  ¶ In that time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts 
of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from 
their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under 
 
foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of 
the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion.

The Oracle concerning Egypt 
1  The burden of Egypt.  
¶ Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into 
Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and 
 
the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. 
2  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall 
 
fight every one against his brother, and every one against his 
neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. 
 
3  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will 
 
destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to 
 
the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the 
wizards. 
4  And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and 
 
a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Lord of 
hosts. 
5  ¶ And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be 
wasted and dried up.
