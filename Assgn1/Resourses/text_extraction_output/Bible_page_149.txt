  150    Exodus 12 
2  This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be 
 
the first month of the year to you. 
3  Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth 
day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, 
according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house: 
 
4  and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his 
neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the 
souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for 
 
the lamb. 
5  Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye 
 
shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 
 
6  and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: 
 
and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in 
the evening. 
7  And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts 
and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 
8  And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and 
unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 
 
9  Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; 
 
his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 
10  And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that 
 
which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
11  And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your 
 
feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the 
   
Lordâ€™s passover.  
12  For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite 
all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and 
 
against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the 
 
Lord. 
13  And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye 
are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague 
 
shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of 
Egypt.
