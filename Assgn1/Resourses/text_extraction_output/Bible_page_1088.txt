  1089    Nehemiah 6 
9  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened 
from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, 
strengthen my hands. 
10  ¶ Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah 
the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet 
 
together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the 
doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the 
   
night will they come to slay thee. 
11  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being 
 
as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. 
 
12  And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he 
 
pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat 
 
had hired him. 
13  Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, 
and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might 
reproach me. 
14  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these 
their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the 
prophets, that would have put me in fear. 
15  ¶ So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month 
Elul, in fifty and two days. 
16  And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all 
the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast 
down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was 
 
wrought of our God. 
17  Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto 
Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. 
18  For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the 
son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had 
 
taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
19  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words 
to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
