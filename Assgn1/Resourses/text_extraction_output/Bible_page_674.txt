  675    1 Samuel 23 
12  Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men 
into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee 
 
up. 
13  Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and 
departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And 
it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare 
 
to go forth. 
14  And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained 
in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him 
every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 
15  ¶ And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David 
 
was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 
16  And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, 
and strengthened his hand in God. 
17  And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father 
 
shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be 
 
next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
 
18  And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode 
 
in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. 
19  ¶ Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not 
David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood, in the hill 
of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? 
 
20  Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of 
thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the 
 
king’s hand. 
21  And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have compassion 
 
on me. 
22  Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his 
haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he 
 
dealeth very subtilely. 
23  See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where 
he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and 
I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, 
 
that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
