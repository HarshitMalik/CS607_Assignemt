  1380    Psalms 131 
4  But there is forgiveness with thee, 
that thou mayest be feared. 
5  I wait for the Lord, 
my soul doth wait, 
and in his word do I hope. 
6  My soul waiteth for the Lord 
more than they that watch for the morning: 
 
I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 
7  Let Israel hope in the Lord: 
 
for with the Lord there is mercy, 
and with him is plenteous redemption. 
8  And he shall redeem Israel 
from all his iniquities.  
131 
Childlike Repose in the Lord 
A Song of degrees of David. 
1  Lord, my heart is not haughty, 
nor mine eyes lofty: 
 
neither do I exercise myself in great matters, 
or in things too high for me. 
2  Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, 
as a child that is weaned of his mother: 
 
my soul is even as a weaned child. 
3  Let Israel hope in the Lord 
from henceforth and for ever.
