  1161    Job 20 
20 
Zophar Depicts the Portion of the Wicked 
1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
2  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, 
and for this I make haste. 
3  I have heard the check of my reproach, 
and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
4  Knowest thou not this of old, 
since man was placed upon earth, 
5  that the triumphing of the wicked is short, 
and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 
 
6  Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, 
and his head reach unto the clouds; 
 
7  yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: 
 
they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? 
 
8  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: 
 
yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 
9  The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; 
 
neither shall his place any more behold him. 
10  His children shall seek to please the poor, 
and his hands shall restore their goods. 
11  His bones are full of the sin of his youth, 
which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
12  Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, 
though he hide it under his tongue; 
 
13  though he spare it, and forsake it not, 
but keep it still within his mouth; 
 
14  yet his meat in his bowels is turned, 
it is the gall of asps within him. 
15  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: 
 
God shall cast them out of his belly. 
16  He shall suck the poison of asps: 
 
the viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him.
