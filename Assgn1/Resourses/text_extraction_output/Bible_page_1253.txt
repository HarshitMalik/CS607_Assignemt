  1254    Psalms 42 
from everlasting, and to everlasting.  
Amen, and Amen. 
42 
Thirsting for God 
To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. 
1  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, 
so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 
2  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: 
 
when shall I come and appear before God? 
 
3  My tears have been my meat day and night, 
while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 
 
4  When I remember these things, 
I pour out my soul in me: 
 
for I had gone with the multitude, 
I went with them to the house of God, 
with the voice of joy and praise, 
with a multitude that kept holyday. 
5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? 
 
And why art thou disquieted in me? 
 
Hope thou in God: 
 
for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. 
6  O my God, my soul is cast down within me: 
 
therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, 
and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. 
7  Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: 
 
all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 
8  Yet the Lord will command his loving-kindness in the daytime, 
and in the night his song shall be with me, 
and my prayer unto the God of my life. 
9  I will say unto God my rock, 
Why hast thou forgotten me?
