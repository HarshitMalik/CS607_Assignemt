  988    2 Chronicles 8 
will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a 
byword among all nations. 
21  And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every 
one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the Lord 
 
done thus unto this land, and unto this house? 
 
22  And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of 
their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, 
and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served 
them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.

Solomon’s Further Activities 
1  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon 
had built the house of the Lord, and his own house, 
2  that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon 
built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. 
3  ¶ And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it. 
4  And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, 
which he built in Hamath. 
5  Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, 
fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
 
6  and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the 
chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon 
desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all 
the land of his dominion. 
7  As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, 
and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were 
not of Israel, 
8  but of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom 
the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to 
pay tribute until this day.
