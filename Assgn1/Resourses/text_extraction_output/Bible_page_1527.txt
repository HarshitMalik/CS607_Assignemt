  1528    Isaiah 22 
2  Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain 
 
men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 
3  All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all 
 
that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far. 
4  Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not 
 
to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my 
people. 
5  ¶ For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity 
by the Lord God of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the 
walls, and of crying to the mountains. 
6  And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and 
Kir uncovered the shield. 
7  And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of 
chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate. 
8  And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in 
that day to the armor of the house of the forest. 
9  Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are 
many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
 
10  And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses 
have ye broken down to fortify the wall. 
11  Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old 
pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had 
 
respect unto him that fashioned it long ago. 
12  ¶ And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to 
mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 
 
13  and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating 
flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we 
   
shall die.  
14  And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts, Surely this 
iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord 
God of hosts.
