  459    Deuteronomy 22 
16  then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he 
hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before 
the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn: 
 
17  but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by 
giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the 
 
beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. 
 
18  ¶ If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey 
the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when 
they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 
 
19  then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring 
him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
 
20  and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is 
stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, 
 
and a drunkard. 
21  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: 
 
so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall 
 
hear, and fear. 
22  ¶ And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to 
be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 
 
23  his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in 
any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of 
 
God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth 
 
thee for an inheritance. 
22 
1  Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide 
thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy 
 
brother. 
2  And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, 
then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with 
thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him 
again. 
3  In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with 
 
his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother’s, which he hath
