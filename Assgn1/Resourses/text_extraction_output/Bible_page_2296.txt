  2297    John 18 
29  Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye 
against this man? 
 
30  They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we 
would not have delivered him up unto thee. 
31  Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according 
to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us 
to put any man to death: 
 
32  that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, 
signifying what death he should die.  
33  ¶ Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called 
Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
 
34  Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others 
tell it thee of me? 
 
35  Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief 
 
priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 
   
36  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom 
 
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not 
be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
 
37  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus 
 
answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and 
for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto 
the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
38  Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? 
 
¶ And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and 
saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. 
Jesus Sentenced to Die 
39  But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the 
passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the 
 
Jews? 
 
40  Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now 
Barabbas was a robber.
