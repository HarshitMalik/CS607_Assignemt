  1609    Isaiah 66 
10  ¶ Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love 
her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 
   
11  that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her 
consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the 
 
abundance of her glory. 
12  For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a 
river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall 
 
ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her 
knees. 
13  As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye 
 
shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
14  And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall 
flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known 
 
toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies. 
15  ¶ For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots 
like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with 
flames of fire. 
16  For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and 
 
the slain of the Lord shall be many. 
17  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens 
behind one tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the 
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the 
Lord. 
18  ¶ For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I 
 
will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see 
 
my glory. 
19  And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape 
of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the 
bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my 
fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory 
 
among the Gentiles. 
20  And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the 
Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, 
and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain
