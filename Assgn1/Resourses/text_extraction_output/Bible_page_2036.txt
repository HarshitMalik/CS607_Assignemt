  2037    Matthew 11 
Not Peace, but a Sword 
34  ¶ Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to 
 
send peace, but a sword. 
35  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the 
daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her 
mother-in-law. 
36  And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.  
37  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: 
 
and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of 
me. 
38  And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not 
worthy of me.  
39  He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for 
 
my sake shall find it.  
Rewards 
40  ¶ He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that receiveth me 
 
receiveth him that sent me.  
41  He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a 
prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the 
 
name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. 
42  And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a 
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto 
you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in 
their cities.
