The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Colossians 
[Colossians] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our 
brother, 
2  ¶ To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at 
Colossae: 
 
¶ Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
Prayer for Spiritual Wisdom 
3  ¶ We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
praying always for you, 
4  since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye 
have to all the saints, 
5  for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard 
before in the word of the truth of the gospel; 
 
6  which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth 
 
fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the 
grace of God in truth: 
 
7  as ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for 
you a faithful minister of Christ; 
 
8  who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. 
9  ¶ For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to 
pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the 
knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
 
10  that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being 
fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of 
God;
