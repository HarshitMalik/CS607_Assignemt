  1451    Proverbs 27 
26  Whose hatred is covered by deceit, 
his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation. 
27  Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: 
 
and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. 
28  A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; 
 
and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. 
27 
1  Boast not thyself of tomorrow; 
 
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.  
2  Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; 
 
a stranger, and not thine own lips. 
3  A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; 
 
but a fool’s wrath is heavier than them both. 
4  Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; 
 
but who is able to stand before envy? 
 
5  Open rebuke is better than secret love. 
6  Faithful are the wounds of a friend; 
 
but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. 
7  The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; 
 
but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 
8  As a bird that wandereth from her nest, 
so is a man that wandereth from his place. 
9  Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: 
 
so doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel. 
10  Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; 
 
neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: 
 
for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. 
11  My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, 
that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 
12  A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; 
 
but the simple pass on, and are punished. 
13  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, 
and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
