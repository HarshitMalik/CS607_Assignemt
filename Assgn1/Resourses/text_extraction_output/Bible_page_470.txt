a loud voice, 
15  Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an 
abomination unto the Lord, the work of the hands of the 
craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place:

fatherless, and widow:  
 
and all the people shall say, 
Amen.

uncovereth his father’s skirt: 
 
and all the people shall say, 
Amen.

and all the people shall say, 
Amen. 
22  Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or 
the daughter of his mother: 
 
and all the people shall say,
