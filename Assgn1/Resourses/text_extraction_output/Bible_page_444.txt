  445    Deuteronomy 15 
2  And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth 
 
aught unto his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his 
 
neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the Lord’s release. 
 
3  Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine 
 
with thy brother thine hand shall release; 
 
4  save when there shall be no poor among you; for the Lord shall 
 
greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee 
for an inheritance to possess it: 
 
5  only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, 
to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee 
this day. 
6  For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou 
 
shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou 
 
shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee. 
Lending to the Poor 
7  ¶ If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within 
any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, 
thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy 
poor brother: 
 
8  but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely 
lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.  
9  Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The 
seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil 
 
against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry 
 
unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee. 
10  Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved 
when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the Lord 
 
thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest 
thine hand unto. 
11  For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command 
 
thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to 
thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
