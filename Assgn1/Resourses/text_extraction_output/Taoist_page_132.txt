Vulgar people have no clear pure mind, while people of
the Way have no polluted dirty mind. That does not mean
they are totally mindless like trees, rocks, cats, or dogs.
PRACTICE
Students of the Way should have their minds on the Way at
all times, no matter what they are doing.
When they walk, they set foot on the path of evenness.
When  they  stand  still,  they  freeze  their  feelings  in
cosmic space.
When they sit, they tune the breathing in the nose.
When  they  recline,  they  embrace  the  jewel  below  the
navel.
Eventually  the  tune  of  the  breathing  is  unbroken,  and
you  are  like  an  imbecile  all  day  long.  This  is  correct
practiceâ€”it has nothing to do with contrived observances.
ENERGY AND SPIRIT
The energy in the body should not be scattered, the spirit
in the mind should not be dimmed.
How do you avoid scattering energy?
By not acting compulsively.
How do you avoid dimming the spirit?
By not keeping things on your mind.
