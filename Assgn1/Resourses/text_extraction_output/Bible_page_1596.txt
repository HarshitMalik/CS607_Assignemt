  1597    Isaiah 59 
8  The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their 
 
goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth 
   
therein shall not know peace. 
9  ¶ Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake 
us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we 
   
walk in darkness. 
10  We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no 
eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate 
   
places as dead men. 
11  We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for 
 
judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. 
 
12  For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins 
testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our 
   
iniquities, we know them; 
 
13  in transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away 
from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and 
uttering from the heart words of falsehood. 
14  And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar 
off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. 
 
15  Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a 
 
prey. 
¶ And the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no 
judgment. 
16  And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no 
intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his 
   
righteousness, it sustained him.  
17  For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of 
salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance 
 
for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. 
18  According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his 
adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay 
 
recompense. 
19  So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his 
glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
