  81    Genesis 34 
13  And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are 
tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me; and if 
 
men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 
14  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will lead 
 
on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the 
children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
15  ¶ And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that 
are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the 
 
sight of my lord. 
16  So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
17  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made 
booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called 
 
Succoth [booths]. 
18  ¶ And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the 
land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his 
 
tent before the city. 
19  And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at 
the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a 
hundred pieces of money. 
20  And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel [God the 
God of Israel].

The Defilement of Dinah Avenged 
1  And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went 
out to see the daughters of the land. 
2  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the 
country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
3  And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved 
the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
4  And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this 
damsel to wife.
