  384    Numbers 29 
29 
1  And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall 
have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of 
   
blowing the trumpets unto you. 
2  And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord; 
 
one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year 
without blemish: 
 
3  and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three 
tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram, 
4  and one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 
 
5  and one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement 
for you: 
 
6  beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and 
the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink 
offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savor, a sacrifice 
made by fire unto the Lord. 
7  ¶ And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month a holy 
convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any 
   
work therein: 
 
8  but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord for a sweet savor; 
 
one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they 
 
shall be unto you without blemish. 
9  And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three 
tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one ram, 
10  a several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 
 
11  one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin offering of 
 
atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat 
offering of it, and their drink offerings. 
12  ¶ And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have a 
holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a 
 
feast unto the Lord seven days:  
 
13  and ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a 
sweet savor unto the Lord; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and 
 
fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish:
