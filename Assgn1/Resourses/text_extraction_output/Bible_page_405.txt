The Fifth Book of Moses, Called 
Deuteronomy 
[Deuteronomy] 
1 
Moses Recounts the Lord’s Promise to Israel at Horeb 
1  These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side 
Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, 
between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and 
Dizahab. 
2  (There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount 
Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.) 
3  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on 
the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of 
Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in 
commandment unto them; 
 
4  after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in 
Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in 
Edrei: 
 
5  on this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare 
this law, saying, 
6  The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt 
long enough in this mount: 
 
7  turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the 
Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the 
hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the 
land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the 
river Euphrates. 
8  Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land 
 
which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
