  2419    Romans 15 
5  Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be 
likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: 
 
6  that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
The Gospel to the Gentiles 
7  ¶ Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to 
the glory of God. 
8  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for 
the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: 
 
9  and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is 
 
written, 
For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, 
and sing unto thy name.  
10  And again he saith, 
Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.  
11  And again, 
Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; 
 
and laud him, all ye people.  
12  And again, Isaiah saith, 
There shall be a root of Jesse, 
and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; 
 
in him shall the Gentiles trust.  
13  Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, 
that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. 
14  ¶ And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also 
are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to 
admonish one another. 
15  Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in 
some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given 
to me of God, 
16  that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, 
ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles 
might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
