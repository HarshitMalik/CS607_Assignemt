  1593    Isaiah 57 
57 
Condemnation of Israel’s Idolatry 
1  The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and 
 
merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous 
is taken away from the evil to come. 
2  He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one 
 
walking in his uprightness. 
3  ¶ But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the 
adulterer and the whore. 
4  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a 
 
wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of 
 
transgression, a seed of falsehood, 
5  inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the 
children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks? 
 
6  Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are 
 
thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast 
 
offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these? 
 
7  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither 
 
wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. 
8  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy 
remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, 
 
and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a 
 
covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. 
 
9  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy 
perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase 
thyself even unto hell. 
10  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, 
 
There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore 
   
thou wast not grieved. 
11  ¶ And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, 
and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I 
 
held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
