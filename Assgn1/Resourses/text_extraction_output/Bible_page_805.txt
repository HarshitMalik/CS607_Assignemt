  806    1 Kings 15 
31  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an 
Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

The Reign of Abijam 
1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat 
reigned Abijam over Judah. 
2  Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
3  And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done 
before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, 
 
as the heart of David his father. 
4  Nevertheless for David’s sake did the Lord his God give him a 
lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish 
Jerusalem: 
 
5  because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and 
turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the 
days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.  
6  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days 
of his life.  
7  Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? And 
 
there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
8  And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city 
 
of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 
 
The Reign of Asa 
9  ¶ And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa 
over Judah. 
10  And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s 
name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
