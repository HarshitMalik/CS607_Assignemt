  958    1 Chronicles 24 
sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the 
Lord.

1  Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; 
 
Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
2  But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: 
 
therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. 
3  And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and 
Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their 
service. 
4  And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of 
the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of 
 
Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, 
and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of 
their fathers. 
5  Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the 
 
governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were 
of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
6  And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, 
wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, 
and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the 
fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being 
 
taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 
7  ¶ Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
8  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
9  the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
10  the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
11  the ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
12  the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
13  the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
14  the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
15  the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, 
16  the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,
