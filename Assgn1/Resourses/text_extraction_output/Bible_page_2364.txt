  2365    Acts 20 
15  And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; 
 
and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; 
 
and the next day we came to Miletus. 
16  For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not 
spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to 
 
be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 
Paul’s Address to the Ephesian Elders 
17  ¶ And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the 
church. 
18  And when they were come to him, he said unto them, 
¶ Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what 
manner I have been with you at all seasons, 
19  serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, 
and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 
 
20  and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have 
showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to 
house, 
21  testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance 
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
22  And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not 
knowing the things that shall befall me there: 
 
23  save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds 
and afflictions abide me. 
24  But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear 
unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the 
ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the 
gospel of the grace of God. 
25  And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone 
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 
26  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the 
blood of all men. 
27  For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
