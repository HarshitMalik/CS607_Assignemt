  208    Exodus 34 
Israel Warned of the Idolatry of Canaan 
11  ¶ Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I 
 
drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the 
Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
12  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the 
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in 
the midst of thee: 
 
13  but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down 
their groves:  
 
14  for thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is 
 
Jealous, is a jealous God. 
15  Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and 
they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, 
and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
 
16  and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters 
go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after 
their gods. 
17  ¶ Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.  
The Three Appointed Feasts 
18  ¶ The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou 
shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the 
month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
 
19  All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy 
 
cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. 
20  But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if 
 
thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the 
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear 
before me empty. 
21  ¶ Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: 
 
in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 
22  And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat 
harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
