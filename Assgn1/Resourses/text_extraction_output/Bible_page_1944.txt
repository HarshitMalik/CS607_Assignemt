into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one 
of them. 
12  But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the 
day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced 
 
over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither 
 
shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. 
13  Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the 
day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their 
 
affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their 
substance in the day of their calamity; 
 
14  neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those 
of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up 
 
those of his that did remain in the day of distress. 
The Exalting of Israel 
15  Â¶ For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast 
 
done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine 
 
own head. 
16  For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the 
heathen drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and they shall 
 
swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. 
17  But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be 
holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. 
 
18  And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a 
flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in 
them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of 
 
the house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken it. 
 
19  And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of 
 
the plain, the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of 
 
Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess 
 
Gilead. 
20  And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess 
that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of
