  1748    Lamentations 3 
for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
49  Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any 
intermission, 
50  till the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. 
51  Mine eye affecteth mine heart, 
because of all the daughters of my city. 
52  Mine enemies chased me sore, 
like a bird, without cause. 
53  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, 
and cast a stone upon me. 
54  Waters flowed over mine head; 
 
then I said, I am cut off. 
55  I called upon thy name, O Lord, 
out of the low dungeon. 
56  Thou hast heard my voice: 
 
hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 
57  Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: 
 
thou saidst, Fear not. 
58  O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; 
 
thou hast redeemed my life. 
59  O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong: 
 
judge thou my cause. 
60  Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations 
against me. 
61  Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, 
and all their imaginations against me; 
 
62  the lips of those that rose up against me, 
and their device against me all the day. 
63  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; 
 
I am their music. 
64  Render unto them a recompense, O Lord, 
according to the work of their hands. 
65  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 
66  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the 
Lord.
