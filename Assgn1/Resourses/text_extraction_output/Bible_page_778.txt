  779    1 Kings 7 
The Furnishings for the Temple 
23  ¶ And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the 
other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a 
   
line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 
24  And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing 
it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were 
 
cast in two rows, when it was cast. 
25  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and 
three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, 
and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon 
 
them, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
26  And it was a handbreadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought 
like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two 
 
thousand baths. 
27  ¶ And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one 
 
base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the 
height of it. 
28  And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, 
 
and the borders were between the ledges: 
 
29  and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, 
and cherubim: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and 
   
beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin 
work. 
30  And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the 
 
four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were 
 
undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. 
31  And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but 
 
the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and 
a half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their 
 
borders, foursquare, not round. 
32  And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the 
 
wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit 
 
and half a cubit.
