  2026    Matthew 7 
3  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but 
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
 
4  Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out 
of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 
   
5  Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and 
 
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s 
eye. 
6  ¶ Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your 
pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and 
turn again and rend you. 
Ask, Seek, Knock 
7  ¶ Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and 
   
it shall be opened unto you: 
 
8  for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; 
   
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
9  Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he 
give him a stone? 
 
10  Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? 
 
11  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your 
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give 
good things to them that ask him? 
 
12  Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to 
you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. 
 
The Narrow Gate 
13  ¶ Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the 
 
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in 
thereat: 
 
14  because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto 
life, and few there be that find it.
