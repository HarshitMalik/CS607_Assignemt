  2194    Luke 11 
25  And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. 
26  Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked 
than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state 
   
of that man is worse than the first. 
True Blessedness 
27  ¶ And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of 
the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the 
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. 
28  But he said, Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, 
and keep it. 
An Evil Generation Seeks a Sign 
29  ¶ And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to 
say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no 
   
sign be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet. 
30  For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of 
man be to this generation. 
31  The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men 
of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the 
 
utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, 
 
behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 
32  The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this 
generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the 
 
preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here. 
 
The Light of the Body 
33  ¶ No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret 
place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which 
come in may see the light.
