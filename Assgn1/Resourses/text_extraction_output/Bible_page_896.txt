  897    2 Kings 24 
34  And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the 
room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and 
took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.  
 
35  And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he 
 
taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment 
of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the 
 
land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto 
Pharaoh-nechoh. 
The Reign of Jehoiakim 
36  ¶ Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; 
 
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name 
was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
37  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to 
all that his fathers had done. 
24 
1  In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and 
Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and 
 
rebelled against him. 
2  And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands 
of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the 
children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, 
according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servants 
the prophets. 
3  Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to 
remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to 
all that he did; 
 
4  and also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem 
 
with innocent blood; which the Lord would not pardon. 
 
5  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they 
not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
