  500    Joshua 4 
12  Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out 
of every tribe a man. 
13  And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the 
priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall 
rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off 
from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand 
 
upon a heap. 
14  ¶ And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, 
to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant 
before the people; 
 
15  and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of 
the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, 
(for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) 
16  that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up 
upon a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; 
 
and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt 
sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right 
 
against Jericho. 
17  And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood 
firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites 
passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean 
over Jordan. 
4 
The Twelve Stones Taken from the Jordan 
1  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over 
Jordan, that the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, 
2  Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
3  and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of 
Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve 
stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in 
the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
