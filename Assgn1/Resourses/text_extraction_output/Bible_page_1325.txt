15  He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: 
 
I will be with him in trouble; 
 
I will deliver him, and honor him. 
16  With long life will I satisfy him, 
and show him my salvation.

Praise for the Lordâ€™s Goodness 
A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. 
1  It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, 
and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: 
 
2  to show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, 
and thy faithfulness every night,

upon the harp with a solemn sound. 
4  For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: 
 
I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
5  O Lord, how great are thy works! 
 
And thy thoughts are very deep. 
6  A brutish man knoweth not; 
 
neither doth a fool understand this. 
7  When the wicked spring as the grass, 
and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; 
 
it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 
 
8  but thou, Lord, art most high for evermore. 
9  For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, 
for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; 
 
all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
10  But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn: 
 
I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 
11  Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies,
