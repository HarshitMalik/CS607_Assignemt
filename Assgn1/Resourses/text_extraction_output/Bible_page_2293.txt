  2294    John 18 
20  Â¶ Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall 
believe on me through their word; 
 
21  that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, 
 
that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that 
 
thou hast sent me. 
22  And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they 
 
may be one, even as we are one: 
 
23  I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; 
 
and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast 
loved them, as thou hast loved me. 
24  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me 
where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given 
 
me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
 
25  O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have 
 
known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. 
26  And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it; that 
 
the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in 
them.

The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus 
1  When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his 
disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the 
which he entered, and his disciples. 
2  And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus 
 
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
3  Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the 
chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and 
torches and weapons. 
4  Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, 
went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? 
 
5  They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am 
he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
