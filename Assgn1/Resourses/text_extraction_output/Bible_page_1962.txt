  1963    Nahum 2 
12  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, 
 
yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. 
Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. 
13  For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy 
bonds in sunder. 
14  And the Lord hath given a commandment concerning thee, that 
no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I 
 
cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy 
 
grave; for thou art vile. 
 
The Tidings of Nineveh’s Fall 
15  ¶ Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good 
tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, 
 
perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; 
   
he is utterly cut off. 
2 
1  He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the 
 
munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power 
mightily. 
2  For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the 
excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and 
 
marred their vine branches. 
3  ¶ The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in 
scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his 
 
preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. 
4  The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against 
another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall 
 
run like the lightnings. 
5  He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; 
   
they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be 
prepared.
