  944    1 Chronicles 17 
39  and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the 
tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, 
40  to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt 
offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to 
all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded 
Israel; 
 
41  and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were 
chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord, 
because his mercy endureth for ever; 
 
42  and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals 
for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments 
of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. 
43  ¶ And all the people departed every man to his house: and David 
 
returned to bless his house.

God’s Covenant with David 
1  Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to 
Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of 
the covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains. 
2  Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God 
 
is with thee. 
3  ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to 
Nathan, saying, 
4  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not 
build me a house to dwell in: 
 
5  for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel 
unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one 
 
tabernacle to another. 
6  Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of 
the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, 
Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
