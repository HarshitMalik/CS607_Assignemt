  1336    Psalms 102 
9  For I have eaten ashes like bread, 
and mingled my drink with weeping, 
10  because of thine indignation and thy wrath: 
 
for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
11  My days are like a shadow that declineth; 
 
and I am withered like grass. 
12  But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever; 
 
and thy remembrance unto all generations. 
13  Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: 
 
for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come. 
14  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, 
and favor the dust thereof. 
15  So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, 
and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
16  When the Lord shall build up Zion, 
he shall appear in his glory. 
17  He will regard the prayer of the destitute, 
and not despise their prayer. 
18  This shall be written for the generation to come: 
 
and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. 
19  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; 
 
from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; 
 
20  to hear the groaning of the prisoner; 
 
to loose those that are appointed to death; 
 
21  to declare the name of the Lord in Zion, 
and his praise in Jerusalem; 
 
22  when the people are gathered together, 
and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord. 
23  He weakened my strength in the way; 
 
he shortened my days. 
24  I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: 
 
thy years are throughout all generations. 
25  Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: 
 
and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
26  They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
