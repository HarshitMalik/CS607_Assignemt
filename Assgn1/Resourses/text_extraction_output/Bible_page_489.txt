  490    Deuteronomy 33 
45  And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 
 
46  and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I 
testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children 
to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
47  For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through 
   
this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over 
Jordan to possess it. 
Moses Permitted to See the Land of Canaan 
48  Â¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 
49  Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is 
in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the 
 
land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a 
possession: 
 
50  and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto 
thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was 
 
gathered unto his people: 
 
51  because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the 
waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye 
 
sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. 
52  Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither 
 
unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

Moses Blesses the Tribes of Israel 
1  And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed 
the children of Israel before his death. 
2  And he said, 
The Lord came from Sinai, 
and rose up from Seir unto them; 
 
he shined forth from mount Paran, 
and he came with ten thousands of saints:
