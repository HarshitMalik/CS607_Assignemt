  65    Genesis 28 
43  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to 
 
Laban my brother to Haran; 
 
44  and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away; 
 
45  until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that 
which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from 
 
thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
   
46  ¶ And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the 
daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, 
 
such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall 
my life do me? 
 
28 
1  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said 
unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
2  Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s 
father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban 
 
thy mother’s brother. 
3  And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply 
thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 
 
4  and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with 
thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, 
 
which God gave unto Abraham. 
5  And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, 
 
son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and 
Esau’s mother. 
6  ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away 
to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he 
 
blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a 
wife of the daughters of Canaan; 
 
7  and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to 
Padan-aram; 
 
8  and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his 
father;
