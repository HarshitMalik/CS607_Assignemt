  1194    Job 39 
Or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
38  when the dust groweth into hardness, 
and the clods cleave fast together? 
 
39  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? 
 
or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
40  when they couch in their dens, 
and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
 
41  Who provideth for the raven his food? 
 
When his young ones cry unto God, 
they wander for lack of meat. 
39 
1  Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring 
forth? 
 
Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
 
2  Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? 
 
Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
 
3  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, 
they cast out their sorrows. 
4  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; 
 
they go forth, and return not unto them. 
5  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? 
 
Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
 
6  whose house I have made the wilderness, 
and the barren land his dwellings. 
7  He scorneth the multitude of the city, 
neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 
8  The range of the mountains is his pasture, 
and he searcheth after every green thing. 
9  Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, 
or abide by thy crib? 
 
10  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? 
 
Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 
 
11  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
