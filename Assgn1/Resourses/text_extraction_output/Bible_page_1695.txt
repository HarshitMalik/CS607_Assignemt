  1696    Jeremiah 36 
23  And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, 
he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the 
hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the 
hearth. 
24  Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, 
nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 
25  Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made 
intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he 
 
would not hear them. 
26  But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and 
Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take 
Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord hid 
 
them. 
27  ¶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king 
had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the 
mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 
28  Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words 
that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath 
burned. 
29  And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the 
Lord; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written 
 
therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and 
destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and 
beast? 
 
30  Therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall 
 
have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall 
 
be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
31  And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their 
iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of 
 
Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have 
pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. 
 
32  ¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, 
the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah 
 
all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had
