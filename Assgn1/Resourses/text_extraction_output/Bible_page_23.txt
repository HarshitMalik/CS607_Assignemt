  24    Genesis 11 
19  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest 
to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and 
 
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 
20  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, 
in their countries, and in their nations. 
21  ¶ Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother 
of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. 
22  The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, 
 
and Aram. 
23  And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
 
24  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
 
25  And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg 
 
[division]; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s 
   
name was Joktan. 
26  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and 
Jerah, 
27  and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
28  and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
29  and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of 
 
Joktan. 
30  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar, a 
mount of the east. 
31  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, 
in their lands, after their nations. 
32  ¶ These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, 
in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth 
 
after the flood.

The Tower of Babel 
1  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 
2  And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they 
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
