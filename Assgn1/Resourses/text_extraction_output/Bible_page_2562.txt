  2563    Hebrews 9 
11  ¶ But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a 
greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is 
to say, not of this building; 
 
12  neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he 
entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal 
redemption for us. 
13  For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer 
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; 
 
14  how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal 
Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience 
from dead works to serve the living God? 
 
15  ¶ And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that 
by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that 
were under the first testament, they which are called might receive 
the promise of eternal inheritance. 
16  For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death 
of the testator. 
17  For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no 
 
strength at all while the testator liveth. 
18  Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. 
19  For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people 
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with 
water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book 
and all the people, 
20  saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined 
unto you.  
21  Moreover he sprinkled likewise with blood both the tabernacle, 
and all the vessels of the ministry.  
22  And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and 
 
without shedding of blood is no remission.
