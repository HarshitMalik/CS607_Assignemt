  809    1 Kings 16 
The Reign of Baasha 
33  ¶ In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of 
Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
34  And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of 
Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 
16 
1  Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against 
Baasha, saying, 
2  Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince 
over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of 
 
Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to 
anger with their sins; 
 
3  behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity 
of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam 
 
the son of Nebat. 
4  Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him 
 
that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 
5  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his 
might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the 
kings of Israel? 
 
6  So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah 
 
his son reigned in his stead. 
7  And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came 
the word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his house, even 
for all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord, in provoking 
him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of 
Jeroboam; and because he killed him. 
 
The Reigns of Elah and Zimri 
8  ¶ In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the 
son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
