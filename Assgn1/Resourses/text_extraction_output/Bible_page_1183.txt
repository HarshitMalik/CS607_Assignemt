  1184    Job 34 
an interpreter, one among a thousand, 
to show unto man his uprightness; 
 
24  then he is gracious unto him, and saith, 
Deliver him from going down to the pit: 
 
I have found a ransom. 
25  His flesh shall be fresher than a childâ€™s: 
 
he shall return to the days of his youth: 
 
26  he shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him: 
 
and he shall see his face with joy: 
 
for he will render unto man his righteousness. 
27  He looketh upon men, and if any say, 
I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, 
and it profited me not; 
 
28  he will deliver his soul from going into the pit, 
and his life shall see the light. 
29  Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 
30  to bring back his soul from the pit, 
to be enlightened with the light of the living. 
31  Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: 
 
hold thy peace, and I will speak. 
32  If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: 
 
speak, for I desire to justify thee. 
33  If not, hearken unto me: 
 
hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.

Elihu Justifies God 
1  Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
2  Hear my words, O ye wise men; 
 
and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 
3  For the ear trieth words, 
as the mouth tasteth meat.
