  2094    Matthew 28 
The Guard at the Tomb 
62  Â¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the 
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 
63  saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet 
alive, After three days I will rise again.  
64  Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third 
day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say 
unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be 
 
worse than the first. 
65  Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure 
 
as ye can. 
66  So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and 
setting a watch.

The Resurrection 
1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day 
of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the 
sepulchre. 
2  And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the 
 
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone 
from the door, and sat upon it. 
3  His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as 
snow: 
 
4  and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. 
5  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for 
 
I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
6  He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where 
 
the Lord lay. 
7  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; 
 
and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see 
 
him: lo, I have told you.
