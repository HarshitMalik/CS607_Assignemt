  1428    Proverbs 15 
but he that honoreth him hath mercy on the poor. 
32  The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: 
 
but the righteous hath hope in his death. 
33  Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: 
 
but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. 
34  Righteousness exalteth a nation: 
 
but sin is a reproach to any people. 
35  The king’s favor is toward a wise servant: 
 
but his wrath is against him that causeth shame. 
15 
1  A soft answer turneth away wrath: 
 
but grievous words stir up anger. 
2  The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: 
 
but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. 
3  The eyes of the Lord are in every place, 
beholding the evil and the good. 
4  A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: 
 
but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. 
5  A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: 
 
but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. 
6  In the house of the righteous is much treasure: 
 
but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 
7  The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: 
 
but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. 
8  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: 
 
but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 
9  The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord: 
 
but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. 
10  Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: 
 
and he that hateth reproof shall die. 
11  Hell and destruction are before the Lord: 
 
how much more then the hearts of the children of men? 
 
12  A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him:
