  174    Exodus 21 
19  if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that 
smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and 
 
shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. 
20  ¶ And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die 
under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 
 
21  Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be 
punished: for he is his money. 
 
22  ¶ If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit 
depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely 
 
punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; 
 
and he shall pay as the judges determine. 
23  And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 
24  eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
25  burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 
Laws concerning Responsibility of Owners 
26  ¶ And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, 
that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake. 
 
27  And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s 
tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake. 
 
28  ¶ If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall 
 
be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of 
 
the ox shall be quit. 
29  But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it 
hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but 
that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and 
 
his owner also shall be put to death. 
30  If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the 
ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
31  Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according 
to this judgment shall it be done unto him. 
32  If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give 
 
unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be 
stoned.
