  2509    Colossians 1 
11  strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto 
all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness; 
 
12  giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be 
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 
 
13  who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath 
translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. 
Reconciliation through Christ’s Death 
14  ¶ In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the 
forgiveness of sins:

creature: 
 
16  for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are 
in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or 
dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by 
 
him, and for him: 
 
17  and he is before all things, and by him all things consist: 
 
18  and he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, 
 
the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the 
 
preeminence. 
19  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; 
 
20  and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to 
reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be 
 
things in earth, or things in heaven.  
Paul’s Ministry to the Church 
21  ¶ And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your 
mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled 
22  in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and 
unblamable and unreprovable in his sight: 
 
23  if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved 
away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which
