Asa’s League with Ben-hadad 
1  In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of 
Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that 
he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2  Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the 
house of the Lord and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad 
king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
3  There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my 
father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, 
   
break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart 
from me. 
4  And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of 
his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and 
 
Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. 
5  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building 
of Ramah, and let his work cease. 
6  Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones 
 
of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; 
 
and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. 
7  ¶ And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and 
said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and 
not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of 
Syria escaped out of thine hand. 
8  Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with very 
many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the 
 
Lord, he delivered them into thine hand. 
9  For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole 
earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is 
perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore 
 
from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
