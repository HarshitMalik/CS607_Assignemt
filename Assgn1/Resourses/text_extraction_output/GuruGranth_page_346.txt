RAAG  AASAA,  FIRST MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  SO DAR ~ THAT GATE:   
 
What is that Gate, and what is that Home, in which You sit and take care of all? Countless 
musical  instruments  of  so  many  various  kinds  vibrate  there  for  You;  so  many  are  the 
musicians  there  for  You.  There  are  so  many  Ragas  there  for  You,  along  with  their 
accompanying harmonies; so many minstrels sing to You. The winds sing to You, as do 
water and fire; the Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door. Chitar and Gupat, the 
recording angels of the conscious and the subconscious, sing to You; they know, and they 
write, and on the basis of what they write, the Lord of Dharma passes judgement. Shiva 
and Brahma and the Goddess Parvaati, so beautiful and ever adorned by You, sing to You. 
The Indras, seated upon their celestial thrones, with the deities at Your Gate, sing to You. 
The  Siddhas  in  Samaadhi  sing  to  You,  and  the  Holy  Saints,  in  their  contemplative 
meditation, sing to You. The celibates, the truthful and the patient beings sing to You, and 
the mighty warriors sing to You. The scholarly Pandits sing to You, along with the holy 
Rishis  and  the  readers  of  the  Vedas  throughout  the  ages.  The  Mohinis,  the  heavenly 
beauties who entice the heart in paradise, in this world and in the nether regions, sing to 
You.  The  fourteen  priceless  jewels  created  by  You,  and  the  sixty-eight  holy  places  of 
pilgrimage, sing to You. The mighty warriors and the divine heroes sing to You, and the 
four sources of creation sing to You. The continents, the worlds and the solar systems, 
created and installed by Your Hand, sing to You. They alone sing to You, who are pleasing 
to Your Will, and who are imbued with the nectar of Your devotional worship. So many 
others sing to You, they do not come into my mind; how can Nanak think of them? That 
Lord and Master — He is True, forever True; He is True, and True is His Name. He who 
created the creation is True, and He shall always be True; He shall not depart, even when 
when  the  creation  departs.  He  created  the  world  of  Maya  with  its  various  colors  and 
species.  Having  created  the  creation,  He  Himself  watches  over  it,  as  it  pleases  His 
Greatness. Whatever pleases Him, that is what He does.
