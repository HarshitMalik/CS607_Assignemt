well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the 
 
midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall 
 
deliver you out of my hands? 
 
16  ¶ Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the 
king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this 
matter. 
17  If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the 
burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O 
king. 
18  But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy 
gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
19  ¶ Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage 
was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore 
 
he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one

down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
24  ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in 
haste, and spake, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast 
three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and 
 
said unto the king, True, O king. 
25  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the 
midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth 
 
is like the Son of God. 
26  ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning 
fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
