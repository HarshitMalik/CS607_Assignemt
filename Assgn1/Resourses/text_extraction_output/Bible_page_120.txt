  121    Genesis 49 
an adder in the path, 
that biteth the horse heels, 
so that his rider shall fall backward. 
18  I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord. 
19  Gad, a troop shall overcome him: 
 
but he shall overcome at the last. 
20  Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, 
and he shall yield royal dainties. 
21  Naphtali is a hind let loose: 
 
he giveth goodly words. 
22  Joseph is a fruitful bough, 
even a fruitful bough by a well; 
 
whose branches run over the wall: 
 
23  the archers have sorely grieved him, 
and shot at him, and hated him: 
 
24  but his bow abode in strength, 
and the arms of his hands were made strong 
by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; 
 
(from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel;) 
 
25  even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; 
 
and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee 
with blessings of heaven above, 
blessings of the deep that lieth under, 
blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 
 
26  the blessings of thy father have prevailed 
above the blessings of my progenitors 
unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: 
 
they shall be on the head of Joseph, 
and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his 
brethren. 
27  Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: 
 
in the morning he shall devour the prey, 
and at night he shall divide the spoil.
