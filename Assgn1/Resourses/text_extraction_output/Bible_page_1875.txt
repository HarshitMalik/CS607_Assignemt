  1876    Daniel 3 
45  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the 
mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the 
brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made 
 
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the 
 
dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. 
46  Â¶ Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and 
worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an 
oblation and sweet odors unto him. 
47  The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your 
God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, 
seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. 
48  Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great 
gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and 
chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. 
49  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, 
and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but 
 
Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

The Deliverance from the Fiery Furnace 
1  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was 
threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in 
 
the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
2  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, 
the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the 
counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come 
to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had 
set up. 
3  Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the 
treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the 
provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image 
that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the 
 
image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
