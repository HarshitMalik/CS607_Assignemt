The Sin of Nadab and Abihu 
1  And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his 
censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered 
strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. 
2  And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and

11  and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which
