  716    2 Samuel 11 
19  And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that 
they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and 
served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon 
any more. 
11 
David and Bath-sheba 
1  And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when 
kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with 
him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and 
 
besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.  
2  ¶ And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off 
his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the 
 
roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very 
 
beautiful to look upon. 
3  And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not 
this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the 
Hittite? 
 
4  And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto 
 
him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her 
 
uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. 
 
5  And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am 
with child. 
6  ¶ And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And 
Joab sent Uriah to David. 
7  And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how 
Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. 
8  And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. 
And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed 
him a mess of meat from the king. 
9  But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants 
of his lord, and went not down to his house.
