The Redemption of the Firstborn 
40  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the 
males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and 
take the number of their names. 
41  And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the Lord) instead of 
all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the 
 
Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children 
of Israel. 
42  And Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the 
firstborn among the children of Israel. 
43  And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month 
old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty 
and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. 
44  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
45  Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of 
Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the 
 
Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord. 
 
46  And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and 
threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, 
which are more than the Levites; 
 
47  thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel 
of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 
   
48  and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them 
is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 
49  And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and 
above them that were redeemed by the Levites: 
 
50  of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a 
 
thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the 
shekel of the sanctuary:
