  1993    Zechariah 9 
21  and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go 
speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts: I 
 
will go also. 
22  Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord 
of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord. 
23  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that 
 
ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even 
shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go 
with you: for we have heard that God is with you. 
 
9 
The Judgment on Neighboring Nations 
1  The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and 
Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all 
 
the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the Lord. 
2  And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it 
 
be very wise. 
3  And Tyrus did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as 
the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
4  Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in 
the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
 
5  Â¶ Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very 
 
sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and 
   
the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be 
inhabited. 
6  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of 
the Philistines.  
7  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his 
abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even 
 
he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and 
Ekron as a Jebusite. 
8  And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because 
of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no
