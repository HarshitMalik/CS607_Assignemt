  1504    Isaiah 7 
7 
Isaiah’s Message to Ahaz 
1  And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son 
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah 
the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to 
war against it, but could not prevail against it.  
2  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate 
with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his 
people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. 
3  ¶ Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, 
thou, and Shear-jashub [the remnant shall return] thy son, at the 
end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s 
field; 
 
4  and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be 
 
faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the 
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
5  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil 
counsel against thee, saying, 
6  Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach 
therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of 
Tabeal: 
 
7  thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to 
pass. 
8  For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is 
Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be 
 
broken, that it be not a people. 
9  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is 
Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be 
established. 
10  ¶ Moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 
11  Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or 
 
in the height above. 
12  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
