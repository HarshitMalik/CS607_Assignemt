  1243    Psalms 35 
it shall rejoice in his salvation. 
10  All my bones shall say, 
Lord, who is like unto thee, 
which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, 
yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? 
 
11  False witnesses did rise up; 
 
they laid to my charge things that I knew not. 
12  They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. 
13  But as for me, when they were sick, 
my clothing was sackcloth: 
 
I humbled my soul with fasting; 
 
and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. 
14  I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: 
 
I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. 
15  But in mine adversity they rejoiced, 
and gathered themselves together: 
 
yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, 
and I knew it not; 
 
they did tear me, and ceased not: 
 
16  with hypocritical mockers in feasts, 
they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 
17  Lord, how long wilt thou look on? 
 
Rescue my soul from their destructions, 
my darling from the lions. 
18  I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: 
 
I will praise thee among much people. 
19  Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: 
 
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.  
20  For they speak not peace: 
 
but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the 
land. 
21  Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, 
and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. 
22  This thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: 
   
O Lord, be not far from me.
