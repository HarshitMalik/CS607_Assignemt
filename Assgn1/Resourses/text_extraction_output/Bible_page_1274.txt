  1275    Psalms 59 
when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, 
let them be as cut in pieces. 
8  As a snail which melteth, 
let every one of them pass away: 
 
like the untimely birth of a woman, 
that they may not see the sun. 
9  Before your pots can feel the thorns, 
he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his 
wrath. 
10  The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: 
 
he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
11  So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: 
 
verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

A Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies 
To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when 
 
Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.  
1  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: 
 
defend me from them that rise up against me. 
2  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, 
and save me from bloody men. 
3  For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: 
 
the mighty are gathered against me; 
 
not for my transgression, 
nor for my sin, O Lord. 
4  They run and prepare themselves without my fault. 
Awake to help me, and behold. 
5  Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, 
awake to visit all the heathen: 
 
be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. 
Selah.
