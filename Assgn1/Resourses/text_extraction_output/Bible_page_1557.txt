  1558    Isaiah 38 
35  For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my 
servant David’s sake. 
36  ¶ Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of 
the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and 
 
when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead 
corpses. 
37  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, 
and dwelt at Nineveh. 
38  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch 
his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with 
the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-
   
haddon his son reigned in his stead.

Hezekiah’s Sickness 
1  In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the 
prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus 
saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and 
 
not live. 
2  Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto 
the Lord, 
3  and said, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have 
walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done 
that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 
4  Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying, 
5  Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David 
thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I 
 
will add unto thy days fifteen years. 
6  And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of 
Assyria: and I will defend this city. 
 
7  ¶ And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord 
will do this thing that he hath spoken;
