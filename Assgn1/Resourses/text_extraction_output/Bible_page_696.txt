  697    2 Samuel 2 
¶ And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh-gilead were 
they that buried Saul.  
5  And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said 
unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have showed this 
kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. 
6  And now the Lord show kindness and truth unto you: and I also 
 
will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 
7  Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: 
 
for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have 
anointed me king over them.

one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of 
the pool. 
14  And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play 
before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
15  Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, 
which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the 
servants of David. 
16  And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
