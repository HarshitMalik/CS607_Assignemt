  1920    Hosea 13 
14  Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he 
 
leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return 
unto him.

The Utter Destruction of Ephraim Foretold 
1  When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but 
 
when he offended in Baal, he died. 
2  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten 
images of their silver, and idols according to their own 
understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of 
 
them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. 
3  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew 
that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out 
of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. 
4  ¶ Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt 
know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me. 
 
5  I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. 
6  According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and 
 
their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. 
 
7  Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will 
 
I observe them: 
 
8  I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will 
rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a 
lion: the wild beast shall tear them. 
 
9  ¶ O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help. 
 
10  I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy 
 
cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and 
 
princes? 
 
11  I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.  
12  ¶ The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
