  1980    Haggai 2 
7  and I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall 
come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. 
 
8  The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. 
9  The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, 
saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the 
 
Lord of hosts. 
The People’s Unfaithfulness Reproved 
10  ¶ In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second 
year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, 
saying, 
11  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the 
 
law, saying, 
12  If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt 
do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be 
holy? And the priests answered and said, No. 
 
13  Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of 
these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It 
 
shall be unclean. 
14  Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this 
nation before me, saith the Lord; and so is every work of their 
 
hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. 
 
15  And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from 
before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord: 
 
16  since those days were, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, 
there were but ten: when one came to the pressvat for to draw out 
 
fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty. 
17  I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the 
labors of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord. 
 
18  Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and 
twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the 
foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid, consider it.
