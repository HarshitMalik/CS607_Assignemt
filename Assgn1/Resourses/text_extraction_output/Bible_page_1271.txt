  1272    Psalms 56 
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; 
 
but I will trust in thee.

A Prayer of Trust 
To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, 
Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.  
1  Be merciful unto me, O God: 
 
for man would swallow me up;

3  What time I am afraid, 
I will trust in thee. 
4  In God I will praise his word, 
in God I have put my trust; 
 
I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 
5  Every day they wrest my words: 
 
all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
6  They gather themselves together, 
they hide themselves, 
they mark my steps, 
when they wait for my soul. 
7  Shall they escape by iniquity? 
 
In thine anger cast down the people, O God. 
8  Thou tellest my wanderings: 
 
put thou my tears into thy bottle: 
 
are they not in thy book? 
 
9  When I cry unto thee, 
then shall mine enemies turn back: 
 
this I know; for God is for me. 
 
10  In God will I praise his word:
