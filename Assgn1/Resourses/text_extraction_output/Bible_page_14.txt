  15    Genesis 6 
28  ¶ And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a 
son: 
 
29  and he called his name Noah [rest or comfort], saying, This same 
shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, 
because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed. 
30  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five 
years, and begat sons and daughters: 
 
31  and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven 
years: and he died. 
 
32  ¶ And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, 
 
Ham, and Japheth. 
6 
The Wickedness of Mankind 
1  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the 
earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
2  that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; 
 
and they took them wives of all which they chose. 
3  And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for 
that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty 
 
years. 
4  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, 
 
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they 
bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of 
old, men of renown. 
5  ¶ And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, 
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only 
evil continually. 
6  And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and 
it grieved him at his heart. 
7  And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from 
the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, 
 
and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
