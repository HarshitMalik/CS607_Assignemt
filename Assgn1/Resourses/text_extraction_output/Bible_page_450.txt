  451    Deuteronomy 18 
15  thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy 
God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king 
 
over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy 
 
brother. 
16  But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to 
return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: 
 
forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth 
return no more that way. 
17  Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not 
away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.  
 
18  ¶ And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, 
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which 
is before the priests the Levites: 
 
19  and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his 
life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the 
 
words of this law and these statutes, to do them: 
 
20  that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn 
not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: 
 
to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his 
children, in the midst of Israel. 
18 
The Portions of the Levites 
1  The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part 
nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the Lord 
 
made by fire, and his inheritance. 
2  Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the 
 
Lord is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.  
3  And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that 
offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto 
 
the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
4  The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the 
first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
