  2377    Acts 25 
18  Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the 
temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.  
19  Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had 
aught against me. 
20  Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evildoing in 
me, while I stood before the council, 
21  except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, 
Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by 
you this day.  
22  ¶ And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect 
knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias 
the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of 
your matter. 
23  And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have 
liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to 
minister or come unto him. 
24  ¶ And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, 
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the 
faith in Christ. 
25  And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to 
come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; 
 
when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
26  He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, 
that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, 
 
and communed with him. 
27  But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, 
 
willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

Paul Appeals to Caesar 
1  Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he 
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
