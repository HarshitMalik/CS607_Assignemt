  2111    Mark 6 
40  And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, 
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that 
were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 
41  And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha 
cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say unto thee,) arise. 
 
42  And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age 
 
of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great 
astonishment. 
43  And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and 
 
commanded that something should be given her to eat.

Jesus Rejected at Nazareth 
1  And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and 
 
his disciples follow him. 
2  And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the 
synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From 
 
whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which

hands?

Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? 
   
And they were offended at him. 
4  But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, but in 
his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 
5  And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands 
upon a few sick folk, and healed them. 
6  And he marveled because of their unbelief. 
Â¶ And he went round about the villages, teaching.
