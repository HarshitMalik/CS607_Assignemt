  1260    Psalms 47 
6  The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: 
 
he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
7  The Lord of hosts is with us; 
 
the God of Jacob is our refuge. 
Selah. 
8  Come, behold the works of the Lord, 
what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
9  He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; 
 
he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; 
 
he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
10  Be still, and know that I am God: 
 
I will be exalted among the heathen, 
I will be exalted in the earth. 
11  The Lord of hosts is with us; 
 
the God of Jacob is our refuge. 
Selah. 
47 
God Is the King of All the Earth 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
1  O clap your hands, all ye people; 
 
shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
2  For the Lord most high is terrible; 
 
he is a great King over all the earth. 
3  He shall subdue the people under us, 
and the nations under our feet. 
4  He shall choose our inheritance for us, 
the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. 
Selah. 
5  God is gone up with a shout, 
the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
