  135    Exodus 6 
18  Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, 
 
yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
19  And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in 
evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish aught from your 
bricks of your daily task. 
20  And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they 
came forth from Pharaoh: 
 
21  and they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; 
 
because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of 
Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their 
hand to slay us. 
The Lord’s Charge to Moses and Aaron 
22  ¶ And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore 
hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent 
 
me? 
 
23  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil 
to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. 
 
6 
1  Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do 
to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a 
 
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 
2  ¶ And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: 
 
3  and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the 
name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known 
 
to them. 
4  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them 
the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were 
strangers. 
5  And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom 
the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my 
 
covenant.
