way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; 
   
but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
19  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, 
nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast 
 
delivered thy soul. 
20  Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, 
and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he 
shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in 
 
his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be 
remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
 
21  Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin 
not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; 
 
also thou hast delivered thy soul. 
The Prophet Made Dumb 
22  Â¶ And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto 
 
me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. 
23  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory 
 
of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of 
Chebar: and I fell on my face. 
 
24  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and 
spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine 
house. 
25  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, 
and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among 
them: 
 
26  and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that 
thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they 
 
are a rebellious house. 
27  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt 
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; He that heareth, let him 
 
hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a 
   
rebellious house.
