The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to 
Timothy 
[2 Timothy] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the 
promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 
2  ¶ To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: 
 
¶ Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus 
our Lord. 
Be Not Ashamed 
3  ¶ I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure 
conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my 
prayers night and day; 
 
4  greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may 
be filled with joy; 
 
5  when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, 
which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; 
 
and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
6  Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of 
God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 
7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of 
 
love, and of a sound mind. 
8  ¶ Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor 
of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the 
 
gospel according to the power of God; 
 
9  who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according 
to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which 
was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began;
