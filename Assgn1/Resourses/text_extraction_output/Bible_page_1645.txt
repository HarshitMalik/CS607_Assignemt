  1646    Jeremiah 16 
20  And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen wall: and 
 
they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: 
 
for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord. 
21  And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will 
redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

The Lord’s Judgment on the People 
1  The word of the Lord came also unto me, saying, 
2  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor 
daughters in this place. 
3  For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the 
daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers 
that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this 
land; 
 
4  They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; 
   
neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face 
 
of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by 
 
famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, 
 
and for the beasts of the earth. 
5  ¶ For thus saith the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, 
neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my 
 
peace from this people, saith the Lord, even loving-kindness and 
mercies. 
6  Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be 
 
buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor 
make themselves bald for them: 
 
7  neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort 
them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of 
 
consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 
8  Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them 
to eat and to drink.
