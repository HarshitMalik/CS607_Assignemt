  1979    Haggai 2 
12  ¶ Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of 
Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, 
obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai 
the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people 
did fear before the Lord. 
13  Then spake Haggai the Lord’s messenger in the Lord’s message 
unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord. 
14  And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of 
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of 
Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the 
people; and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of 
 
hosts, their God, 
15  in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second 
year of Darius the king.

The Glory of the New Temple 
1  In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, 
came the word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai, saying, 
2  Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, 
and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the 
residue of the people, saying, 
3  Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and 
 
how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as 
 
nothing? 
 
4  Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O 
 
Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people 
 
of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the 
 
Lord of hosts: 
 
5  According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out 
of Egypt, so my Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. 
 
6  For thus saith the Lord of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I 
 
will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
