true liquid has not been produced, or the fire in the furnace
has not been ignited, no state is genuine.
It  is  altogether  essential  to  reach  the  point  where  the
eyes,  ears,  nose,  and  tongue  merge,  and  vitality,  energy,
and  spirit  fuse;  that  is  when  the  light  of  insight  shines
forth. If you do not wait for the medicine to be produced
and the fire to ignite, how can the great elixir be refined?
If the firing is insufficient, the negative polluted energy in
the  body  cannot  be  cleared  away.  Then  pure  positive
energy cannot rise.
I always tell people that the first essential of practice is
to  even  the  temper  well.  You  should  not  practice  sitting
hastily; wait until positive energy rises and the medicine is
producedâ€”only then is the time right.
When  it  comes  to  contemplating  emptiness,  it  is
essential to attain reversal of attention inward, the state of
turning the light around. Rolling the eyes up into the head
is  not  reversal  of  attention,  nor  is  it  turning  the  light
around  when  the  eyes  see  darkness.  You  must  reach  the
point where the eyes do not see, the ears do not hear, and
the  breathing  in  the  nose  is  extremely  subtle.  Then  you
have  no  eyes,  ears,  nose,  tongue,  body,  or  mind;  you  are
aware  only  of  the  existence  of  the  primary  opening,
nothing else.
When  you  arrive  here,  the  light  of  your  true  nature
emerges.  This  is  called  the  celestial  monarch  of  the  four
elements offering a bowl.
