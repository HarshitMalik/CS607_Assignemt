  845    2 Kings 6 
23  And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, 
and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of 
garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare 
 
them before him. 
24  And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and 
bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they 
 
departed. 
25  But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto 
him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went 
 
no whither. 
26  And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the 
man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to 
 
receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and 
vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and 
maidservants? 
 
27  The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto 
thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white 
as snow.

The Axe Head Made to Float 
1  And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the 
place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 
2  Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a 
beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And 
he answered, Go ye. 
3  And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. 
And he answered, I will go. 
4  So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut 
down wood. 
5  But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and 
 
he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
