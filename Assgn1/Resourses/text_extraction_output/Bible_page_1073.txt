  1074    Ezra 10 
13  And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our 
great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than 
our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; 
 
14  should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity 
with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry 
 
with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no 
remnant nor escaping? 
 
15  O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we remain yet 
 
escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our 
 
trespasses; for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

Foreign Wives and Children Put Away 
1  Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping 
and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled 
unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women 
and children: for the people wept very sore. 
 
2  And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, 
answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, 
and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now 
 
there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. 
3  Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all 
the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of 
my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our 
God; and let it be done according to the law. 
 
4  Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: 
     
be of good courage, and do it. 
5  Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all 
Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And 
they sware. 
6  Â¶ Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into 
the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
