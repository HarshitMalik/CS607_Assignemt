  367    Numbers 22 
30  And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou 
hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to 
 
do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 
 
31  ¶ Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel 
of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: 
 
and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 
32  And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou 
smitten thine ass these three times? Behold, I went out to 
 
withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: 
 
33  and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless 
 
she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved 
her alive. 
34  And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I 
 
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, 
 
if it displease thee, I will get me back again. 
35  And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but 
 
only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So 
Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
36  ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to 
meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, 
which is in the utmost coast. 
37  And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to 
call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able 
   
indeed to promote thee to honor? 
 
38  And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now 
 
any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my 
 
mouth, that shall I speak. 
39  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth. 
40  And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the 
princes that were with him.
