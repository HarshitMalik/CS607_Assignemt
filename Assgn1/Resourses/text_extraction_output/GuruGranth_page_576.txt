One who is pleasing to God receives true honor. The Lord God automatically blesses 
him with wealth. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to such  a humble being. O Lord, You 
bless all with Your bountiful blessings.  || 2 ||   When it pleases You, then I am satisfied 
and satiated. My mind is soothed and calmed, and all my thirst is quenched. My mind is 
soothed and calmed, the burning has ceased, and I have found all sorts of treasures. All 
the  Sikhs  and  servants  partake  of  them;  I  am  a  sacrifice  to  the  True  Guru.  I  have 
become fearless, imbued with the Love of my Lord and Master; I have shaken off the 
fear of death. Slave Nanak, Your humble servant, lovingly embraces Your meditation; O 
Lord, please be with me always.  || 3 ||   My hopes and desires have been fulfilled, O 
my Lord. I am worthless, without virtue; all virtues are Yours, O Lord. All virtues are 
Yours,  O  my  Lord  and  Master;  with  what  mouth  should  I  praise  You?  You  did  not 
consider my merits and demerits; you forgave me in an instant. I have obtained the 
nine treasures, congratulations are pouring in, and the unstruck melody resounds. Says 
Nanak,  I  have  found  my  Husband  Lord  within  my  own  home,  and  all  my  anxiety  is 
forgotten.  || 4 || 1 ||   SHALOK:  Why do you listen to falsehood? It shall vanish like a 
gust of wind. O Nanak, those ears are acceptable, which listen to the True Master.  || 1 
||   CHHANT:  I am a sacrifice to those who listen  to the Lord God with their ears. 
Intuitively embellished are those, who with their tongues chant the Name of the Lord, 
Har,  Har.  They  are  intuitively  embellished  with  priceless  virtues;  they  have  come  to 
save the world. God‟s Feet are the boat, which carries many across the terrifying world-
ocean. Those who are blessed with the favor of my Lord and Master are not asked to 
render their account. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who listen to God with their 
ears.  || 1 ||   SHALOK:  With my eyes, I have seen the Light, but my immense thirst is 
not quenched. O Nanak, those eyes are different, which behold my Husband Lord.  || 1 
||   CHHANT:  I am a sacrifice to those who have seen the Lord God. In the True Court 
of  the  Lord,  they  are  approved.  They  are  approved  by  their  Lord  and  Master,  and 
acclaimed as supreme; they are attuned to the Lord‟s Love. They are satiated with the 
sublime  essence  of  the  Lord,  and  they  merge  in  celestial  peace;  in  each  and  every 
heart,  they  see  the  all-pervading  Lord.  They  alone  are  the  friendly  Saints,  and  they 
alone are happy, who are pleasing to their Lord and Master. Says Nanak, I am forever a 
sacrifice to those who have seen the Lord God.  || 2 ||   SHALOK:  The body is blind, 
totally blind and desolate, without the Naam. O Nanak, fruitful is the life of that being, 
within whose heart the True Lord and Master abides.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  I am cut into 
pieces  as  a  sacrifice,  to  those  who  have  seen  my  Lord  God.  His  humble  servants 
partake of the sweet Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, and are satiated. The Lord 
seems sweet to their minds; God is merciful to them. His Ambrosial Nectar rains down 
upon them, and they are at peace. Pain is eliminated and doubt is dispelled from the 
body; meditating on the Lord of the World, their victory is celebrated.
