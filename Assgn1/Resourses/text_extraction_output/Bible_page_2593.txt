  2594    2 Peter 1 
11  for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the 
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
12  ¶ Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in 
remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be 
established in the present truth. 
13  Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up 
by putting you in remembrance; 
 
14  knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our 
Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me. 
15  Moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to 
have these things always in remembrance. 
Eyewitnesses of Christ’s Glory 
16  ¶ For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we 
made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
17  For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there 
came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
18  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were 
with him in the holy mount.  
19  We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well 
 
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until 
the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: 
 
20  knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any 
private interpretation. 
21  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy 
 
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
