his sons inheritance out of his own possession; that my people be 
 
not scattered every man from his possession. 
19  ¶ After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of 
the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked 
toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides 
 
westward. 
20  Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil 
the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the 
meat offering; that they bear them not out into the outer court, to 
 
sanctify the people. 
21  ¶ Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to 
pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner 
 
of the court there was a court. 
22  In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty 
cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. 
 
23  And there was a row of building round about in them, round about 
them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows 
round about. 
24  Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where 
the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

The Healing Waters from the Temple 
1  Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, 
 
behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house 
eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and 
 
the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, 
at the south side of the altar. 
2  Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led 
me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that 
looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right 
 
side.
