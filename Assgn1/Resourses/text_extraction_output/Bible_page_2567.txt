  2568    Hebrews 11 
8  ¶ By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place 
which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he 
 
went out, not knowing whither he went.  
9  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange 
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs 
with him of the same promise:  
 
10  for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and 
maker is God. 
11  Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, 
and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she 
judged him faithful who had promised. 
12  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so 
many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is 
by the seashore innumerable.  
13  ¶ These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but 
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and 
embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims 
on the earth.  
14  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a 
country. 
15  And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence 
they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. 
16  But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore 
 
God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for 
 
them a city. 
17  ¶ By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he 
 
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  
18  of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  
 
19  accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; 
 
from whence also he received him in a figure. 
20  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  
21  By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of 
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
