  304    Numbers 2 
51  And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it 
down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall 
 
set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
 
52  And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his 
own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their 
hosts. 
53  But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, 
that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of 
Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of 
 
testimony. 
54  And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord 
commanded Moses, so did they. 
2 
The Camps and Leaders of the Tribes 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
2  Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, 
with the ensign of their fatherâ€™s house: far off about the tabernacle 
 
of the congregation shall they pitch. 
3  And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the 
standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and 
 
Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of 
Judah. 
4  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were 
threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred. 
5  And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: 
 
and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of 
Issachar. 
6  And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and 
four thousand and four hundred. 
7  Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be 
 
captain of the children of Zebulun.
