The Book of Job 
[Job]

Job’s Calamities 
1  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that 
 
man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and 
eschewed evil. 
2  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
3  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand 
camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, 
and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all 
 
the men of the east. 
4  And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; 
 
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with 
them. 
5  And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that 
Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and 
offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job 
 
said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their 
hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
6  ¶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present 
themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. 
7  And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan 
 
answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, 
and from walking up and down in it. 
8  And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant 
Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright 
man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
 
9  Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for 
nought?
