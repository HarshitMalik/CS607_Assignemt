BHAGAVAD GITA
Yacchokam ucchoshanam indriyaanaam;
Avaapya bhoomaavasapatnam riddham
Raajyam suraanaam api chaadhipatyam.
8. I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses even if I should
attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Evam uktwaa hrisheekesham gudaakeshah parantapah;
Na yotsya iti govindam uktwaa tooshneem babhoova ha.
Sanjaya said:
9. Having spoken thus to Hrishikesa (Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the conqueror of sleep),
the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna: “I will not fight,” and became silent.
Tam uvaacha hrisheekeshah prahasanniva bhaarata;
Senayor ubhayor madhye visheedantam idam vachah.
10. To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Sri Krishna, as if smiling, O
Bharata, spoke these words!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Ashochyaan anvashochastwam prajnaavaadaamshcha bhaashase;
Gataasoon agataasoomshcha naanushochanti panditaah.
The Blessed Lord said:
11. Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of
wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.
Na twevaaham jaatu naasam na twam neme janaadhipaah;
Na chaiva na bhavishyaamah sarve vayam atah param.
12. Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease
to be hereafter.
Dehino’smin yathaa dehe kaumaaram yauvanam jaraa;
Tathaa dehaantara praaptir dheeras tatra na muhyati.
13. Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also
does he pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.
Maatraasparshaastu kaunteya sheetoshnasukhaduhkhadaah;
Aagamaapaayino’nityaas taamstitikshaswa bhaarata.
