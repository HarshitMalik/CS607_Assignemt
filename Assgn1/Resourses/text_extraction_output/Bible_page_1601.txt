  1602    Isaiah 63 
5  For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: 
 
and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God 
rejoice over thee. 
6  ¶ I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall 
never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the 
 
Lord, keep not silence, 
7  and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a 
praise in the earth. 
8  The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his 
strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine 
enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for 
 
the which thou hast labored: 
 
9  but they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and 
 
they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my 
holiness. 
10  ¶ Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the 
 
people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a 
     
standard for the people. 
11  Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say 
ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, 
 
his reward is with him, and his work before him.  
12  And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the 
Lord: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken. 
 
63 
The Day of the Lord’s Vengeance 
1  Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from 
Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the 
 
greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to 
 
save. 
2  Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him 
that treadeth in the winevat?
