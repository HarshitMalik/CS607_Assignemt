  879    2 Kings 18 
40  Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former 
manner. 
41  ¶ So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven 
images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did 
 
their fathers, so do they unto this day.

The Reign of Hezekiah 
1  Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of 
Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
2  Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he 
 
reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name 
also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. 
3  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according 
to all that David his father did. 
4  He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down 
the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had 
made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to 
 
it: and he called it Nehushtan [a piece of brass]. 
 
5  He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none 
 
like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before 
him. 
6  For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from following him, 
but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses. 
7  And the Lord was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he 
 
went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served 
 
him not. 
8  He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, 
from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
