  1630    Jeremiah 8 
12  Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, 
 
they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore 
 
shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation 
 
they shall be cast down, saith the Lord.  
13  I will surely consume them, saith the Lord: there shall be no grapes 
 
on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the 
 
things that I have given them shall pass away from them. 
14  ¶ Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the 
 
defensed cities, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God 
 
hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because 
we have sinned against the Lord. 
15  We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, 
 
and behold trouble! 
 
16  ¶ The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land 
 
trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they 
 
are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, 
 
and those that dwell therein. 
17  For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which 
will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord. 
A Lament for Judah and Jerusalem 
18  ¶ When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in 
me. 
19  Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of 
them that dwell in a far country: Is not the Lord in Zion? is not 
   
her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their 
 
graven images, and with strange vanities? 
 
20  The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. 
21  For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; 
   
astonishment hath taken hold on me. 
22  ¶ Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is 
   
not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
