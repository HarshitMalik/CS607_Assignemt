  2491    Ephesians 3 
13  but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off are made 
nigh by the blood of Christ. 
14  For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken 
down the middle wall of partition between us; 
 
15  having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of 
commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of 
 
twain one new man, so making peace; 
 
16  and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the 
cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 
 
17  and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to 
them that were nigh.  
18  For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 
19  Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow 
citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 
 
20  and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, 
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 
 
21  in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy 
temple in the Lord: 
 
22  in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God 
through the Spirit.

Paulâ€™s Ministry to the Gentiles 
1  For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 
2  if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is 
given me to you-ward: 
 
3  how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I 
 
wrote afore in few words; 
 
4  whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the 
mystery of Christ,) 
5  which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as 
it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
