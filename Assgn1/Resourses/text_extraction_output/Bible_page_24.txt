  25    Genesis 11 
3  And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn 
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they 
for mortar. 
4  And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top 
may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be 
 
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
5  And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the 
children of men builded. 
6  And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all 
one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be 
   
restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 
7  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they 
may not understand one another’s speech. 
8  So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of 
all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 
 
9  Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did 
 
there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did 
 
the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
