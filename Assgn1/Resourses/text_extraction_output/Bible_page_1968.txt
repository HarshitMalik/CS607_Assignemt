3  For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall 
speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely 
   
come, it will not tarry.  
4  Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just 
 
shall live by his faith.  
5  Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, 
neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as 
death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, 
and heapeth unto him all people. 
Woes on the Unrighteous 
6  ¶ Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting 
proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which 
is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick 
   
clay! 
 
7  Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that 
shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? 
 
8  Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the 
people shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and for the violence 
 
of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. 
9  ¶ Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that 
he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the 
power of evil! 
 
10  Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many 
people, and hast sinned against thy soul. 
11  For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the 
timber shall answer it. 
12  ¶ Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a 
city by iniquity! 
 
13  Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in 
the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very 
vanity? 
 
14  For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
