You  are  so  wonderful!  Your  creative  potency  is  amazing!    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||      You 
Yourself are the Cause of causes; You Yourself are the Creator. By the Hukam of Your 
Command, we are born, and by Your Command, we die.  || 2 ||   Your Name is the 
Support of our mind and body. This is Your blessing to Nanak, Your slave.  || 3 || 8 ||

Deep within my inner being, is the longing to meet my Beloved; how can I find the 
Perfect  Guru?  Even  though  a  baby  may  play  hundreds  of  games,  he  cannot  survive 
without milk. The hunger deep within me is not satisfied, O my friend, even though I 
am served hundreds of dishes. My mind and body are filled with love for my Beloved; 
how can my mind be comforted, without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan?  || 1 ||   
Listen, O my dear friends and Siblings of Destiny — lead me to my True Friend, the 
Giver of peace. He knows all the troubles of my soul; every day, he tells me stories of 
the Lord. I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant. I cry out for Him, as the 
song-bird cries for water. Which of Your Excellent Virtues should I contemplate? You 
save  even  worthless  beings  like  me.    ||  2  ||      I  have  become  sad  and  depressed, 
longing for my Husband Lord, O my friend; when will I see my Husband with my eyes? 
I have forgotten how to enjoy all pleasures; without my Husband Lord, they are of no 
use at all. These clothes do not bring my body any pleasure; I cannot dress myself. I 
bow to those friends of mine, who have enjoyed their Beloved Husband Lord.  || 3 ||   I 
have adorned myself with all sorts of decorations, O my friend, but without my Husband 
Lord, they are of no use at all. When my Husband does not care for me, O my friend, 
then my youth passes away, totally useless. Blessed, blessed are the happy soul-brides, 
O my friend, who are immersed in their Husband Lord. I am a sacrifice to those happy 
soul-brides, O my friend; I wash their feet forever.  || 4 ||   As long as I suffered from 
duality and doubt, O my friend, I thought that God was far away. But when I met the 
Perfect True Guru, O my friend, then all my hopes and desires were fulfilled. I have 
obtained  all  pleasures and comforts, O  my  friend; my  Husband Lord is all-pervading 
everywhere. Servant Nanak enjoys the Lord‟s Love, O my friend; I fall at the feet of the 
Guru, the True Guru.  || 5 || 1 || 9 ||

True is the Bani of His Word, and True is the melody; True is contemplative meditation 
on the Word of the Shabad. Night and day, I praise the True Lord. Blessed, blessed is 
my great good fortune.  || 1 ||   O my mind, be a sacrifice to the True Name.
