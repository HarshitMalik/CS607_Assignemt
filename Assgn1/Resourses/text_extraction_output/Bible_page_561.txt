  562    Judges 4 
3  And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine 
 
hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed 
 
the children of Israel. 
4  ¶ And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged 
Israel at that time. 
5  And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah 
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up 
 
to her for judgment. 
6  And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-
naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel 
commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take 
with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the 
children of Zebulun? 
 
7  And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of 
Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver 
 
him into thine hand. 
8  And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: 
 
but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. 
9  And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the 
 
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the Lord 
 
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and 
went with Barak to Kedesh. 
10  And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up 
 
with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. 
 
11  ¶ Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the 
father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and 
pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh. 
12  ¶ And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone 
up to mount Tabor. 
13  And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred 
chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from 
Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. 
14  And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the 
 
Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone
