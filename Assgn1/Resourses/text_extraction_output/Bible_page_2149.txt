Dedication to Theophilus 
1  Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a 
declaration of those things which are most surely believed among 
us, 
2  even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning 
were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 
 
3  it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all 
things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most 
excellent Theophilus, 
4  that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein 
thou hast been instructed. 
The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold 
5  ¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest 
named Zechariah, of the course of Abijah: and his wife was of the 
 
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. 
6  And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the 
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
7  And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren; and they 
 
both were now well stricken in years. 
8  ¶ And it came to pass, that, while he executed the priest’s office 
before God in the order of his course, 
9  according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn 
incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
10  And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the 
time of incense.
