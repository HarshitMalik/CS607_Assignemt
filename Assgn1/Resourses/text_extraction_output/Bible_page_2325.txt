  2326    Acts 7 
46  who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for 
the God of Jacob.  
47  But Solomon built him a house.  
48  Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
 
as saith the prophet, 
49  Heaven is my throne, 
and earth is my footstool: 
 
what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: 
   
or what is the place of my rest? 
 
50  Hath not my hand made all these things?  
 
51  ¶ Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always 
resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  
 
52  Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they 
 
have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just 
One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 
   
53  who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have 
not kept it. 
The Stoning of Stephen 
54  ¶ When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and 
they gnashed on him with their teeth. 
55  But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into 
heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right 
hand of God, 
56  and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man 
standing on the right hand of God. 
57  Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and 
ran upon him with one accord, 
58  and cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid 
 
down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul. 
59  And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, 
receive my spirit. 
60  And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not 
this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
