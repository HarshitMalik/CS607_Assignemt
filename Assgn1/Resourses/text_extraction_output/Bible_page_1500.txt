  1501    Isaiah 5 
I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 
7  For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, 
and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: 
 
and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; 
 
for righteousness, but behold a cry. 
Woes Pronounced on the Wicked 
8  ¶ Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till 
there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the 
earth! 
 
9  In mine ears said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall 
be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. 
10  Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a 
homer shall yield an ephah. 
11  ¶ Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may 
follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame 
 
them! 
 
12  And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in 
their feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither 
 
consider the operation of his hands. 
13  ¶ Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no 
knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their 
 
multitude dried up with thirst. 
14  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth 
without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their 
 
pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. 
15  And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man 
shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: 
 
16  but the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is 
holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. 
17  Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places 
of the fat ones shall strangers eat. 
18  ¶ Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as 
it were with a cart rope:
