  1208    Psalms 8 
judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, 
and according to mine integrity that is in me. 
9  Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; 
 
but establish the just: 
 
for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.  
10  My defense is of God, 
which saveth the upright in heart. 
11  God judgeth the righteous, 
and God is angry with the wicked every day. 
12  If he turn not, he will whet his sword; 
 
he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
13  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; 
 
he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 
14  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, 
and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 
15  He made a pit, and digged it, 
and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 
16  His mischief shall return upon his own head, 
and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 
17  I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: 
 
and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.

A Psalm of David. 
1  O Lord our Lord, 
how excellent is thy name in all the earth! 
 
who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
2  Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained 
strength 
because of thine enemies,
