  1305    Psalms 78 
and caused waters to run down like rivers.  
17  And they sinned yet more against him 
by provoking the Most High in the wilderness. 
18  And they tempted God in their heart 
by asking meat for their lust. 
19  Yea, they spake against God; 
 
they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
 
20  Behold, he smote the rock, 
that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; 
 
can he give bread also? 
 
Can he provide flesh for his people? 
 
21  Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: 
 
so a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
and anger also came up against Israel; 
 
22  because they believed not in God, 
and trusted not in his salvation: 
 
23  though he had commanded the clouds from above, 
and opened the doors of heaven, 
24  and had rained down manna upon them to eat, 
and had given them of the corn of heaven.  
25  Man did eat angelsâ€™ food: 
 
he sent them meat to the full. 
26  He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: 
 
and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
27  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, 
and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
 
28  and he let it fall in the midst of their camp, 
round about their habitations. 
29  So they did eat, and were well filled: 
 
for he gave them their own desire; 
 
30  they were not estranged from their lust: 
 
but while their meat was yet in their mouths, 
31  the wrath of God came upon them, 
and slew the fattest of them, 
and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
