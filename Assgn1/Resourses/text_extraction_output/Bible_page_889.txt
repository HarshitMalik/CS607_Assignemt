  890    2 Kings 22 
17  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his 
sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the 
Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
18  And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden 
of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned 
 
in his stead. 
The Reign of Amon 
19  ¶ Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and 
he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
20  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father 
Manasseh did. 
21  And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served 
the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 
 
22  and he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the 
way of the Lord. 
23  And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king 
in his own house. 
24  And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against 
king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in 
 
his stead. 
25  Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written 
in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
26  And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and 
 
Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

The Reign of Josiah 
1  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 
thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
