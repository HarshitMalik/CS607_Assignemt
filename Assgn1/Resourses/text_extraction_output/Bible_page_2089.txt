  2090    Matthew 27 
5  And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, 
and went and hanged himself. 
6  And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful 
for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. 
7  And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to 
bury strangers in. 
8  Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  
9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, 
saying, 
And they took the thirty pieces of silver, 
the price of him that was valued, 
whom they of the children of Israel did value; 
 
10  and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.  
Pilate Questions Jesus 
11  ¶ And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked 
 
him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto 
 
him, Thou sayest. 
12  And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he 
answered nothing. 
13  Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they 
witness against thee? 
 
14  And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor 
 
marveled greatly. 
Jesus Sentenced to Die 
15  ¶ Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the 
people a prisoner, whom they would. 
16  And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
17  Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto 
them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus 
 
which is called Christ? 
 
18  For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
