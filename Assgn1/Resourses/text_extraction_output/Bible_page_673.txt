  674    1 Samuel 23 
23 
David in the Wilderness 
1  Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against 
Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 
2  Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite 
these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite 
 
the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
3  And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in 
Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the 
 
armies of the Philistines? 
 
4  Then David inquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord 
answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver 
 
the Philistines into thine hand. 
5  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the 
Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a 
great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
6  ¶ And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to 
David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
7  And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, 
God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by 
 
entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
8  And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to 
Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
9  And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; 
 
and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
10  Then said David, O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly 
heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for 
my sake. 
11  Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come 
 
down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech 
 
thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.
