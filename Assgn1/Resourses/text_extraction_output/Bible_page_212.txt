  213    Exodus 36 
34  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and 
Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
35  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of 
work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the 
embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, 
and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that 
devise cunning work. 
36 
1  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, 
in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how 
to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, 
according to all that the Lord had commanded. 
Moses Restrains the People from Bringing Gifts 
2  Â¶ And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted 
man, in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, even every one 
whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 
 
3  and they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of 
Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to 
make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every 
morning. 
4  And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, 
came every man from his work which they made; 
 
5  and they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more 
than enough for the service of the work, which the Lord 
commanded to make. 
6  And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be 
proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor 
woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So 
the people were restrained from bringing. 
7  For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and 
too much.
