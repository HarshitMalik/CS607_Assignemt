  1668    Jeremiah 26 
38  He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate 
 
because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce 
anger. 
26 
Jeremiah Threatened with Death 
1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of 
Judah came this word from the Lord, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord; Stand in the court of the Lord’s house, and 
 
speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the 
Lord’s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto 
them; diminish not a word: 
   
3  if so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, 
that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them 
because of the evil of their doings. 
4  And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; If ye will not 
 
hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 
5  to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent 
unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not 
hearkened; 
 
6  then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a 
curse to all the nations of the earth. 
7  So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah 
speaking these words in the house of the Lord. 
8  ¶ Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking 
all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, 
that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, 
saying, Thou shalt surely die. 
9  Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This 
house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an 
inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in 
 
the house of the Lord.
