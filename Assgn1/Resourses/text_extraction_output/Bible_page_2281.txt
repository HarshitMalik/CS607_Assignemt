  2282    John 12 
The Unbelief of the Jews 
37  But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they 
believed not on him: 
 
38  that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he 
spake, 
Lord, who hath believed our report? 
 
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  
 
39  Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again, 
40  He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; 
 
that they should not see with their eyes, 
nor understand with their heart, 
and be converted, and I should heal them.  
41  These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 
42  Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; 
 
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they 
should be put out of the synagogue: 
 
43  for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 
The Judgment of Jesus’ Word 
44  ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on 
me, but on him that sent me. 
45  And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 
46  I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me 
should not abide in darkness. 
47  And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: 
 
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that 
judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him 
 
in the last day. 
49  For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he 
 
gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should 
speak.
