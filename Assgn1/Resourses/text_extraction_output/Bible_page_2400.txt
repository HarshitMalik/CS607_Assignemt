  2401    Romans 6 
4  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like 
 
as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, 
even so we also should walk in newness of life.  
5  ¶ For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, 
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 
 
6  knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body 
of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 
7  For he that is dead is freed from sin. 
8  Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live 
with him: 
 
9  knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; 
 
death hath no more dominion over him. 
10  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he 
 
liveth unto God. 
11  Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but 
alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
12  ¶ Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should 
obey it in the lusts thereof. 
13  Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness 
unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from 
 
the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto 
God. 
14  For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the 
 
law, but under grace. 
Servants of Righteousness 
15  ¶ What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but 
 
under grace? God forbid. 
 
16  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his 
servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of 
 
obedience unto righteousness? 
 
17  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have 
obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered 
you.
