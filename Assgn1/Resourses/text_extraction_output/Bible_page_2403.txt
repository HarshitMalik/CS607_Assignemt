  2404    Romans 8 
20  Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that 
dwelleth in me. 
21  Â¶ I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with 
me. 
22  For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
 
23  but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of 
my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is 
in my members. 
24  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of 
 
this death? 
 
25  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I 
myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

Life in the Spirit 
1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in 
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
2  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free 
from the law of sin and death. 
3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the 
flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and 
for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 
 
4  that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk 
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
5  For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but 
 
they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 
6  For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is 
 
life and peace. 
7  Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject 
 
to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 
8  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
