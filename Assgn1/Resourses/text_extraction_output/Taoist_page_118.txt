be  fathomed  retrospectively  or  prospectively,  cannot  be
sought  by  reflections  or  echoes.  No  one  knows  why  it  is
so,  yet  it  is  so.  Penetrating  life  completely,  this  is  called
the Way.
Perfect  sages  attained  this  in  ancient  times;  sublime
teachings transmit it in the present. If you investigate the
principles  according  to  the  terms,  they  are  completely
veracious.  Superior  people  believe  wholeheartedly;  they
master  themselves  and  practice  diligently,  emptying  their
minds  and  opening  their  spirits  so  that  the  Way  alone
comes and concentrates.
The Way has profound power; it gradually changes the
body  and  spirit.  When  the  body  follows  the  way  to
penetration and wholly unites with the spirit, such a person
is called a spiritual human.
The spiritual nature is nonresistant and fluid; its essence
never changes or perishes. When the body is assimilated to
the Way, there is thus no birth and death. In concealment,
the body is the same as the spirit; when revealed, the spirit
is the same as energy. That is how it is possible to “walk
on  water  and  fire  without  injury”  and  “cast  no  shadow
under the sun or moon.” Whether to remain in existence or
disappear is up to oneself; one goes out and in the gateway
of nothingness.
The  body  is  a  material  residue,  yet  it  can  still  reach
immaterial  subtlety;  how  much  deeper  and  further  can
spiritual  knowledge  reach!  The  Scripture  of  the  Living
Spirit says, “When body and spirit are unified, that is the
