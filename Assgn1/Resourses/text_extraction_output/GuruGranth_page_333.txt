When  the  Lord  and  Master  is  kind  and  grants  His  Grace,  then  her  affairs  are  all 
resolved. Then she is known as the happy soul-bride, if she contemplates the Word of 
the Guru‟s Shabad.  || 3 ||   Bound by the actions she has committed, she wanders 
around — see this and understand. What can we say to her? What can the poor soul-
bride do?  || 4 ||   Disappointed and hopeless, she gets up and departs. There is no 
support or encouragement in her consciousness. So remain attached to the Lord‟s Lotus 
Feet, and hurry to His Sanctuary, Kabeer!  || 5 || 6 || 50 ||   GAUREE:  The Yogi says 
that Yoga is good and sweet, and nothing else is, O Siblings of Destiny. Those who 
shave their heads, and those who amputate their limbs, and those who utter only a 
single word, all say that they have attained the spiritual perfection of the Siddhas.  || 1 
||   Without the Lord, the blind ones are deluded by doubt. And those, to whom I go to 
find release — they themselves are bound by all sorts of chains.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The 
soul  is  re-absorbed  into  that  from  which  it  originated, when  one  leaves this path  of 
errors. The scholarly Pandits, the virtuous, the brave and the generous, all assert that 
they  alone  are  great.    ||  2  ||      He  alone  understands,  whom  the  Lord  inspires  to 
understand. Without understanding, what can anyone do? Meeting the True Guru, the 
darkness is dispelled, and in this way, the jewel is obtained.  || 3 ||   Give up the evil 
actions  of  your  left  and  right  hands,  and  grasp  hold  of  the  Feet  of  the  Lord.  Says 
Kabeer, the mute has tasted the molasses, but what can he say about it if he is asked?

RAAG GAUREE POORBEE,  KABEER JEE:    
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Where something existed, now there is nothing. The five elements are no longer there. 
The  Ida,  the  Pingala  and  the  Sushmanaa  —  O  human  being,  how  can  the  breaths 
through these be counted now?  || 1 ||   The string has been broken, and the Sky of 
the Tenth Gate has been destroyed. Where has your speech gone? This cynicism afflicts 
me, night and day; who can explain this to me and help me understand?  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   Where the world is — the body is not there; the mind is not there either. The Joiner 
is forever unattached; now, within whom is the soul said to be contained?  || 2 ||   By 
joining the elements, people cannot join them, and by breaking, they cannot be broken, 
until the body perishes. Of whom is the soul the master, and of whom is it the servant? 
Where, and to whom does it go?  || 3 ||   Says Kabeer, I have lovingly focused my 
attention  on that place where the Lord dwells, day and night. Only He Himself truly 
knows the secrets of His mystery; He is eternal and indestructible.  || 4 || 1 || 52 ||   
GAUREE:  Let contemplation and intuitive meditation be your two ear-rings, and true 
wisdom your patched overcoat. In the cave of silence, dwell in your Yogic posture; let 
the subjugation of desire be your spiritual path.  || 1 ||   O my King, I am a Yogi, a 
hermit, a renunciate. I do not die or suffer pain or separation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The 
solar systems and galaxies are my horn; the whole world is the bag to carry my ashes. 
Eliminating  the  three  qualities  and  finding  release  from  this  world  is  my  deep 
meditation.  || 2 ||   My mind and breath are the two gourds of my fiddle, and the Lord 
of all the ages is its frame.
