  855    2 Kings 9 
Jehu Kills Joram 
14  ¶ So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired 
against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all 
Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. 
15  But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds 
which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king 
of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth 
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. 
16  So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. 
 
And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 
17  ¶ And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied 
the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And 
Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him 
say, Is it peace? 
 
18  So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith 
the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with 
 
peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The 
 
messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 
19  Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and 
said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast 
 
thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 
 
20  And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and 
cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son 
 
of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. 
 
21  ¶ And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. 
And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each 
in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the 
portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
22  And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, 
Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of 
 
thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? 
 
23  And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is 
treachery, O Ahaziah.
