  1389    Psalms 140 
and that my soul knoweth right well. 
15  My substance was not hid from thee 
when I was made in secret, 
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 
16  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; 
 
and in thy book all my members were written, 
which in continuance were fashioned, 
when as yet there was none of them. 
17  How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! 
 
How great is the sum of them! 
 
18  If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: 
 
when I awake, I am still with thee. 
19  Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: 
 
depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 
20  For they speak against thee wickedly, 
and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 
21  Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? 
 
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 
 
22  I hate them with perfect hatred: 
 
I count them mine enemies. 
23  Search me, O God, and know my heart: 
 
try me, and know my thoughts: 
 
24  and see if there be any wicked way in me, 
and lead me in the way everlasting.

A Prayer for Protection against Persecutors 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: 
 
preserve me from the violent man; 
 
2  which imagine mischiefs in their heart;
