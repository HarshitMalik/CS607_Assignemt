Spirit,  energy,  and  vitality  are  always  trying  to  leave
people; as long as you can keep them stable and make sure

It is asked, “People say that when the mystic female is
established,  the  true  vitality  is  stabilized.  How  can  we
establish the mystic female?”
It  is  established  when  “the  open  spirit  does  not  die.”
How  does  the  open  spirit  not  die?  When  you  have  no
desire and are serene as can be, then it does not die.
Those  who  are  good  at  self-cultivation  take  the  fire  of
spirit  and  the  water  of  vitality  and  combine  them  in  one
place. When calmness eventually reaches its limit, it gives
birth  to  movement;  the  fire  of  realization  steams,  and
golden vitality spews beauty penetrating the passes.

Those  who  educated  people  in  olden  times  educated
them  by  means  of  the  Way  of  sages.  The  I  Ching  says,
“Nurturing  rectitude  by  innocence  is  the  accomplishment
