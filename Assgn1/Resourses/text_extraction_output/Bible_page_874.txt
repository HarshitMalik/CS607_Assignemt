offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the 
 
blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and 
 
the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by. 
16  Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz 
commanded. 
17  ¶ And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the 
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen 
 
oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. 
18  And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and 
the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the Lord for 
the king of Assyria. 
19  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written 
in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
20  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in 
the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

The Fall of Samaria and the Captivity of Israel 
1  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of 
Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 
2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as 
the kings of Israel that were before him. 
3  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea 
 
became his servant, and gave him presents. 
4  And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had 
 
sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the 
king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of 
 
Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. 
5  Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and 
went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
6  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and 
carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in 
Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
