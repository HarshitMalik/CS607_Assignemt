  204    Exodus 33 
26  then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the 
Lord’s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered 
 
themselves together unto him. 
27  And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put 
every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate 
throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every 
man his companion, and every man his neighbor. 
28  And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and 
 
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
29  For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even 
every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow 
 
upon you a blessing this day. 
30  ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the 
people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the 
 
Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 
 
31  And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have 
sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
32  Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin —; and if not, blot me, I pray 
 
thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
33  And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against 
me, him will I blot out of my book. 
34  Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have 
spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee: 
   
nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon 
them. 
35  ¶ And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf, 
which Aaron made.

The Lord’s Presence Promised 
1  And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and 
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt,
