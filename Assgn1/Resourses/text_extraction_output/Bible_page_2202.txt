  2203    Luke 13 
There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore 
 
come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.  
15  The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not 
each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, 
and lead him away to watering? 
 
16  And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom 
Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this 
bond on the sabbath day? 
 
17  And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were 
ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that 
 
were done by him. 
The Parable of the Mustard Seed 
18  ¶ Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and 
 
whereunto shall I resemble it? 
 
19  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into 
his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the 
   
air lodged in the branches of it. 
The Parable of the Leaven 
20  ¶ And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
 
21  It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of 
meal, till the whole was leavened. 
The Narrow Gate 
22  ¶ And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and 
journeying toward Jerusalem. 
23  Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he 
 
said unto them, 
24  Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will 
 
seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
