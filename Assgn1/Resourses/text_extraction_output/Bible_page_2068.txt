  2069    Matthew 21 
on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered 
away. 
20  And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is 
the fig tree withered away! 
 
21  Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have 
faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig 
tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, 
and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.  
 
22  And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall 
receive. 
Jesus’ Authority Questioned 
23  ¶ And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the 
elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By 
what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this 
 
authority? 
 
24  And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one 
thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what 
authority I do these things. 
25  The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And 
   
they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From 
heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 
   
26  But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as 
   
a prophet. 
27  And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said 
unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
The Parable of the Two Sons 
28  ¶ But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to 
   
the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. 
29  He answered and said, I will not; but afterward he repented, and 
 
went.
