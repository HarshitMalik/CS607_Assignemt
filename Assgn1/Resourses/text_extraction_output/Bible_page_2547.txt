The Epistle of Paul to 
Philemon 
[Philemon] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, 
¶ Unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer, 
2  and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and 
to the church in thy house: 
 
3  ¶ Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 
Philemon’s Love and Faith 
4  ¶ I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
5  hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord 
Jesus, and toward all saints; 
 
6  that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the 
acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
7  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the 
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
Paul Pleads for Onesimus 
8  ¶ Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee 
that which is convenient, 
9  yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such a one as Paul the 
aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
10  I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my 
bonds: 
 
11  which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to 
thee and to me:
