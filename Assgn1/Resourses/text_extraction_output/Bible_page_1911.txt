  1912    Hosea 7 
5  Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by 
 
the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that 
 
goeth forth. 
6  For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God 
 
more than burnt offerings. 
7  ¶ But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have 
 
they dealt treacherously against me. 
8  Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with 
blood. 
9  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests 
murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 
 
10  I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the 
 
whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
11  ¶ Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I returned the 
captivity of my people.

Israel’s Iniquity and Rebellion 
1  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was 
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit 
 
falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers 
 
spoileth without. 
2  And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their 
wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are 
   
before my face. 
3  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes 
with their lies. 
4  They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth 
from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. 
5  In the day of our king, the princes have made him sick with bottles 
of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
