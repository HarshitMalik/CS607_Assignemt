  1608    Isaiah 66 
66 
The Lord’s Judgments and Zion’s Future Hope 
1  Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my 
footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is 
   
the place of my rest?  
 
2  For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have 
been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is 
 
poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 
3  ¶ He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a 
 
lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if 
 
he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an 
 
idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul 
delighteth in their abominations. 
4  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon 
them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they 
   
did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in 
 
which I delighted not. 
5  ¶ Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your 
 
brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, 
Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they 
 
shall be ashamed. 
6  A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of 
the Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemies. 
7  ¶ Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she 
 
was delivered of a man child.  
8  Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall 
   
the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be 
 
born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her 
 
children. 
9  Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the 
 
Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy 
   
God.
