  1865    Ezekiel 47 
The Borders and Divisions of the Land 
13  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; This shall be the border, whereby ye 
 
shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph 
 
shall have two portions. 
14  And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which 
 
I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land 
 
shall fall unto you for inheritance. 
15  ¶ And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, 
from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 
 
16  Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of 
Damascus and the border of Hamath: Hazar-hatticon, which is by 
 
the coast of Hauran. 
17  And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of 
Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. 
And this is the north side. 
18  ¶ And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from 
Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, 
from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side. 
19  ¶ And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of 
strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side 
southward. 
20  ¶ The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man 
come over against Hamath. This is the west side. 
21  ¶ So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of 
Israel. 
22  And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an 
inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, 
which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you 
 
as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have 
 
inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
23  And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger 
sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord 
God.
