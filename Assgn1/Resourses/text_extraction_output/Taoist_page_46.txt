thoughts,  it  is  first  necessary  to  see  through  fame  and
profit.
Fame  is  hated  by  Creation,  profit  is  an  object  of
emotional contention. Therefore fame and profit are more
fatal than weapons. Why? With the way weapons can kill,
people  know  to  avoid  them;  but  with  the  way  fame  and
profit kill, people will go to their deaths unrepentant.
In  ancient  times,  people  imbued  with  the  Way  often
feigned  madness,  because  they  did  not  want  people  to
know them. Nowadays if people have the slightest strength
they want to announce it to the whole world—how base!
When  cultured  people  study  the  Way,  they  forget  all
competitiveness  and  self-display.  Inconspicuously  they
practice inner cultivation, and when the Way is clear and
their  character  is  established,  they  still  do  not  claim
expertise.  Therefore  it  is  said,  “That  in  respect  to  which
cultivated  people  cannot  be  reached  is  only  that  which
people do not see.”
Profit is something that has no virtue yet attracts people.
It  makes  people  hot  without  fire.  It  has  no  authority  yet
gets  people  to  labor  willingly.  It  has  no  affections  yet
makes  people  never  forget  it  for  a  moment.  It  causes
students of the Way to ruin their character once they have
seen it; it causes administrators to twist the law once they
have seen it. Since ancient times human hearts and laws of
nations have often been spoiled by profit.
There is great harm for the world concealed within great
profit,  but  people  do  not  know  it.  Not  that  they  do  not
