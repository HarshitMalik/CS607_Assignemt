  1687    Jeremiah 33 
44  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal 
them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places 
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the 
mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the 
south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the Lord. 
 
33 
The Restoration of Prosperity to Jerusalem 
1  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second 
time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, 
to establish it; the Lord is his name; 
   
3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and 
mighty things, which thou knowest not. 
4  For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses 
of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which 
are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 
 
5  They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with 
the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in 
my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this 
city. 
6  Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and 
will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
7  And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to 
return, and will build them, as at the first. 
8  And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have 
sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby 
 
they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. 
9  And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all 
the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do 
unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and 
 
for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
