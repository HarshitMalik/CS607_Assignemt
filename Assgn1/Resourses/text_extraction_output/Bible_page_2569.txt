  2570    Hebrews 12 
37  they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were 
slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and 
 
goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 
   
38  of whom the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and 
 
in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. 
39  ¶ And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, 
received not the promise: 
 
40  God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us 
should not be made perfect. 
12 
The Chastening of the Lord 
1  Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a 
cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which 
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is 
set before us, 
2  looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the 
 
joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, 
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
3  ¶ For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners 
against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
4  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. 
5  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as 
unto children, 
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, 
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
 
6  for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, 
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  
7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for 
 
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
 
8  But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then 
are ye bastards, and not sons.
