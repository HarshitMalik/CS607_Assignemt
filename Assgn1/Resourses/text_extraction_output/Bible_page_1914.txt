  1915    Hosea 9 
14  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and 
 
Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his 
 
cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

The Punishment for Israel’s Persistent Unfaithfulness 
1  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a 
 
whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every 
cornfloor. 
2  The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine 
shall fail in her. 
3  They shall not dwell in the Lord’s land; but Ephraim shall return 
 
to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria. 
4  They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they 
be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread 
 
of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread 
   
for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord. 
5  ¶ What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of 
the Lord? 
 
6  For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather 
 
them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their 
 
silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their 
 
tabernacles. 
7  ¶ The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; 
 
Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, 
 
for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. 
8  The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a 
 
snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. 
9  They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: 
 
therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. 
10  ¶ I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as 
 
the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baal-
