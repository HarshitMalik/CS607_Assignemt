  1282    Psalms 65 
and shall trust in him; 
 
and all the upright in heart shall glory. 
65 
Praise for Godâ€™s Bounty in Nature 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm and Song of David. 
1  Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: 
 
and unto thee shall the vow be performed. 
2  O thou that hearest prayer, 
unto thee shall all flesh come. 
3  Iniquities prevail against me: 
 
as for our transgressions, 
thou shalt purge them away. 
4  Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, 
and causest to approach unto thee, 
that he may dwell in thy courts: 
 
we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, 
even of thy holy temple. 
5  By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, 
O God of our salvation; 
 
who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, 
and of them that are afar off upon the sea: 
 
6  which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; 
 
being girded with power: 
 
7  which stilleth the noise of the seas, 
the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 
8  They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: 
 
thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 
9  Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: 
 
thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of 
water:
