  1097    Nehemiah 9 
7  Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and 
broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the 
name of Abraham;  
 
8  and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant 
with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the 
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, 
to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou 
 
art righteous. 
9  ¶ And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest 
their cry by the Red sea;  
 
10  and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his 
servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that 
 
they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it 
is this day. 
11  And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went 
through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors 
 
thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.  
12  Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in 
 
the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein 
they should go.  
13  Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them 
from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good 
statutes and commandments: 
 
14  and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst 
them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy 
servant:  
 
15  and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and 
broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and 
promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which 
thou hadst sworn to give them.  
16  ¶ But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, 
and hearkened not to thy commandments, 
17  and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou 
didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion 
 
appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God
