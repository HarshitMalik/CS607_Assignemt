  2498    Ephesians 6 
The Whole Armor of God 
10  ¶ Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of 
his might. 
11  Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand 
against the wiles of the devil. 
12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against 
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of 
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
13  Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be 
able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and 
having on the breastplate of righteousness;  
 
15  and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  
 
16  above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to 
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, 
which is the word of God: 
 
18  praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and 
watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all 
saints; 
 
19  and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open 
my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 
20  for which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak 
 
boldly, as I ought to speak. 
Final Greetings 
21  ¶ But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a 
beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make 
known to you all things: 
 
22  whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might 
know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.  
23  ¶ Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
