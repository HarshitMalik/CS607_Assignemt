13  and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be 
at peace among yourselves. 
14  Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort 
the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. 
15  See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow 
 
that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. 
16  Rejoice evermore. 
17  Pray without ceasing. 
18  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus 
 
concerning you. 
19  Quench not the Spirit. 
20  Despise not prophesyings. 
21  Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
 
22  Abstain from all appearance of evil. 
23  ¶ And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God 
 
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto 
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
24  Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
