  1172    Job 28 
10  Will he delight himself in the Almighty? 
 
Will he always call upon God? 
 
11  I will teach you by the hand of God: 
 
that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
12  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; 
 
why then are ye thus altogether vain? 
 
13  This is the portion of a wicked man with God, 
and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the 
Almighty. 
14  If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: 
 
and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 
15  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: 
 
and his widows shall not weep. 
16  Though he heap up silver as the dust, 
and prepare raiment as the clay; 
 
17  he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, 
and the innocent shall divide the silver. 
18  He buildeth his house as a moth, 
and as a booth that the keeper maketh. 
19  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: 
 
he openeth his eyes, and he is not. 
20  Terrors take hold on him as waters, 
a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
21  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: 
 
and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 
22  For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: 
 
he would fain flee out of his hand. 
23  Men shall clap their hands at him, 
and shall hiss him out of his place.
