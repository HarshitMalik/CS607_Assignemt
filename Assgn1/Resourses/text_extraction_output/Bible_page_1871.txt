Daniel Interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream 
1  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, 
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was 
troubled, and his sleep brake from him. 
2  Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the 
astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the 
king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
3  And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my 
spirit was troubled to know the dream. 
4  Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, O king, live for 
ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the 
 
interpretation. 
5  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone 
from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the 
 
interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses 
shall be made a dunghill. 
6  But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall 
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me 
 
the dream, and the interpretation thereof. 
7  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the 
dream, and we will show the interpretation of it. 
8  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain 
the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. 
9  But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one 
decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to 
 
speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the 
 
dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation 
thereof. 
10  The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a 
man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter: therefore there 
 
is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, 
or astrologer, or Chaldean.
