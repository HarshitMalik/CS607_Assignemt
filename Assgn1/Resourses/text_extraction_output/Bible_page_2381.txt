  2382    Acts 26 
Paul’s Witness to Jews and Gentiles 
19  ¶ Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the 
heavenly vision: 
 
20  but showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and 
throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that 
they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for 
repentance. 
21  For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about 
to kill me. 
22  Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, 
witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than 
those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
 
23  that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should 
rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and to 
the Gentiles.  
Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe 
24  ¶ And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, 
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
 
25  But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the 
 
words of truth and soberness. 
26  For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak 
freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden 
 
from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
 
27  King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou 
 
believest. 
28  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a 
Christian. 
29  And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that 
hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, 
except these bonds. 
30  ¶ And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the 
governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
