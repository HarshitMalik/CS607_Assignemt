  1633    Jeremiah 10 
The Knowledge of God Is Man’s Glory 
23  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, 
neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man 
glory in his riches: 
 
24  but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and 
knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, 
judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I 
 
delight, saith the Lord. 
25  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will punish all them 
which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; 
 
26  Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and 
Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the 
wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the 
 
house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. 
10 
The False Gods and the True God 
1  Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of 
Israel: 
 
2  thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not 
dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at 
 
them. 
3  For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of 
 
the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. 
4  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and 
 
with hammers, that it move not. 
5  They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs 
 
be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they 
 
cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. 
6  ¶ Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great, 
 
and thy name is great in might.
