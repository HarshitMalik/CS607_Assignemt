  2089    Matthew 27 
Peter Denies Jesus 
69  ¶ Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto 
 
him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
70  But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
71  And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, 
and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus 
of Nazareth. 
72  And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
73  And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to 
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech betrayeth 
 
thee. 
74  Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. 
And immediately the cock crew. 
75  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, 
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, 
and wept bitterly.

Jesus Brought before Pilate 
1  When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the 
people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
 
2  and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered 
him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 
The Death of Judas 
3  ¶ Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was 
condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces 
of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
4  saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. 
And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
