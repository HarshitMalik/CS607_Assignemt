  2290    John 16 
27  and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from 
the beginning. 
16 
1  These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be 
offended. 
2  They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, 
 
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. 
3  And these things will they do unto you, because they have not 
known the Father, nor me. 
4  But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye 
may remember that I told you of them. 
¶ And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I 
was with you. 
The Work of the Holy Spirit 
5  But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh 
 
me, Whither goest thou? 
 
6  But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled 
your heart. 
7  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go 
 
away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; 
   
but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 
8  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of 
righteousness, and of judgment: 
 
9  of sin, because they believe not on me; 
 
10  of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 
 
11  of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. 
12  ¶ I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them 
now. 
13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you 
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he 
   
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.
