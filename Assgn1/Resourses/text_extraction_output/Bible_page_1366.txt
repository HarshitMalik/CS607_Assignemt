  1367    Psalms 119 
for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: 
 
but I will meditate in thy precepts. 
79  Let those that fear thee turn unto me, 
and those that have known thy testimonies. 
80  Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; 
 
that I be not ashamed. 
caph 
81  My soul fainteth for thy salvation: 
 
but I hope in thy word. 
82  Mine eyes fail for thy word, 
saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 
 
83  For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; 
 
yet do I not forget thy statutes. 
84  How many are the days of thy servant? 
 
When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 
 
85  The proud have digged pits for me, 
which are not after thy law. 
86  All thy commandments are faithful: 
 
they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. 
 
87  They had almost consumed me upon earth; 
 
but I forsook not thy precepts. 
88  Quicken me after thy loving-kindness; 
 
so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.

89  For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. 
90  Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: 
 
thou hast established the earth, 
and it abideth. 
91  They continue this day according to thine ordinances: 
 
for all are thy servants. 
92  Unless thy law had been my delights, 
I should then have perished in mine affliction. 
93  I will never forget thy precepts: 
 
for with them thou hast quickened me. 
94  I am thine, save me;
