  766    1 Kings 2 
the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of 
Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
33  Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon 
the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, 
 
and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for 
ever from the Lord. 
34  So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and 
slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
 
35  And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the 
host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of 
 
Abiathar. 
36  ¶ And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build 
thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence 
any whither. 
37  For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the 
brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely 
die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
 
38  And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the 
 
king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in 
Jerusalem many days. 
39  ¶ And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the 
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of 
Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in 
Gath. 
40  And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish 
to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants 
 
from Gath. 
41  And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to 
Gath, and was come again. 
42  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I 
not make thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, 
saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest 
abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst 
 
unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
