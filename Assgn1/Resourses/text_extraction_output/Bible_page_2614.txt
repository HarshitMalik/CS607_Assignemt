The Revelation 
of St. John the Divine 
[Revelation] 
1 
The Revelation of Jesus Christ 
1  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show 
unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he 
 
sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 
 
2  who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus 
Christ, and of all things that he saw. 
3  Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this 
prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the 
 
time is at hand. 
Greetings to the Seven Churches 
4  ¶ John to the seven churches which are in Asia: 
 
¶ Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, 
and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before 
 
his throne;  
 
5  and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first-
begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.  
¶ Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own 
blood, 
6  and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to 
 
him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
7  Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and 
 
they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail 
 
because of him. Even so, Amen. 
8  ¶ I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the 
Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
