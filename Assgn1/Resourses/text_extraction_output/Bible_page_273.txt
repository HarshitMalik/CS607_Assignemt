  274    Leviticus 19 
13  ¶ Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the wages 
 
of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the 
morning.  
14  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the 
blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord. 
 
15  ¶ Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not 
 
respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: 
 
but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.  
16  Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; 
 
neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am the 
 
Lord. 
17  ¶ Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any 
 
wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. 
18  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of 
thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the 
 
Lord. 
19  ¶ Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender 
with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: 
   
neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon 
thee.  
20  ¶ And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, 
betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given 
her; she shall be scourged: they shall not be put to death, because 
   
she was not free. 
21  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass 
offering. 
22  And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of 
the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath 
done; and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. 
 
23  ¶ And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all 
manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as 
uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it 
   
shall not be eaten of.
