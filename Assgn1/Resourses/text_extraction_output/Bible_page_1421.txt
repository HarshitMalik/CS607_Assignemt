  1422    Proverbs 11 
16  A gracious woman retaineth honor: 
 
and strong men retain riches. 
17  The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: 
 
but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. 
18  The wicked worketh a deceitful work: 
 
but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. 
19  As righteousness tendeth to life; 
 
so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. 
20  They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord: 
 
but such as are upright in their way are his delight. 
21  Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: 
 
but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. 
22  As a jewel of gold in a swineâ€™s snout, 
so is a fair woman which is without discretion. 
23  The desire of the righteous is only good: 
 
but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 
24  There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; 
 
and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to 
poverty. 
25  The liberal soul shall be made fat: 
 
and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. 
26  He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: 
 
but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. 
27  He that diligently seeketh good procureth favor: 
 
but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. 
28  He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: 
 
but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. 
29  He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: 
 
and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. 
30  The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; 
 
and he that winneth souls is wise. 
31  Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: 
 
much more the wicked and the sinner.
