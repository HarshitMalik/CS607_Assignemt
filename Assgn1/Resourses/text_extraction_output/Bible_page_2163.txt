  2164    Luke 4 
Jesus Begins His Ministry 
14  ¶ And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and 
 
there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. 
15  And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 
Jesus Rejected at Nazareth 
16  ¶ And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as 
 
his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and 
stood up for to read. 
17  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. 
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it 
was written, 
18  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; 
 
he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, 
to preach deliverance to the captives, 
and recovering of sight to the blind, 
to set at liberty them that are bruised, 
19  to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.  
20  And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat 
down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were 
fastened on him. 
21  And he began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled 
in your ears. 
22  And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words 
which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this 
Joseph’s son? 
 
23  And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, 
Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in 
 
Capernaum, do also here in thy country. 
24  And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his 
own country.
