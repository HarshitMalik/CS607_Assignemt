whole  wall  itself  is  gone,  and  there  is  openness,  free
access, and no further obstruction.
The Book of Manners says, “Think in a dignified way.”
That it is dignified means it is not forced, that it is done in
this way means it is not labored. When it is not forced or
labored, it can be called good thinking.
“The  thinking  of  a  cultivated  man  does  not  go  beyond
his position.” This is called thinking. Whenever it is out of
place, it is called thoughts. Thinking is a door of entry into
the Way, whereas thoughts are roots of obstruction of the
Way.
THOUGHTS
Simply  because  of  unawareness,  thoughts  suddenly  arise;
this  is  called  ignorance.  Because  of  the  arising  of
ignorance,  it  seems  mind  becomes  thoughts.  Mind  really
does  not  move;  when  you  reach  this  point  in  observing
mind, those thoughts cease of themselves.
Stopping thoughts is not hard—if you can turn back to
before  a  single  thought  has  arisen,  then  the  preceding
thought will naturally not continue.
Before  arousal,  we  are  merged  with  the  infinite.  But  if
you  want  to  understand  the  nonoccurrence  of  a  single
thought  right  now,  you  must  examine  where  thought
comes from. The past is based on the present, the future is
based on the past; if you have no mind in the present, the
past is naturally over.
