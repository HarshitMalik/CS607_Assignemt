  782    1 Kings 8 
6  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord 
unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, 
even under the wings of the cherubim. 
7  For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the 
ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
8  And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen 
out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen 
without: and there they are unto this day. 
 
9  There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which 
Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with 
the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
10  And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, 
11  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: 
 
for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.

12  Â¶ Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the 
thick darkness. 
13  I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee 
to abide in for ever. 
14  And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation 
of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood; 
   
15  and he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which spake with 
his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled 
it, saying, 
16  Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I 
chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my 
name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people 
 
Israel.  
17  And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the 
name of the Lord God of Israel.
