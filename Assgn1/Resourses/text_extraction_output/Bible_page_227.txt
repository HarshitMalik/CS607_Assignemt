The Third Book of Moses, Called 
Leviticus 
[Leviticus] 
1 
Burnt Offerings 
1  And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the 
tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of 
you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering 
of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. 
3  ¶ If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male 
without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the 
 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord. 
4  And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and 
 
it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
5  And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord: and the priests, 
 
Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round 
about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
6  And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. 
7  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and 
lay the wood in order upon the fire: 
 
8  and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the 
fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the 
altar: 
 
9  but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest 
 
shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made 
by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
10  ¶ And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the 
goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
