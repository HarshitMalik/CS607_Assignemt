BHAGAVAD GITA
55. By devotion he knows Me in truth, what and who I am; and knowing Me in truth, he
forthwith enters into the Supreme.
Sarvakarmaanyapi sadaa kurvaano madvyapaashrayah;
Matprasaadaadavaapnoti shaashwatam padamavyayam.
56. Doing all actions always, taking refuge in Me, by My Grace he obtains the eternal,
indestructible state or abode.
Chetasaa sarvakarmaani mayi sannyasya matparah;
Buddhiyogam upaashritya macchittah satatam bhava.
57. Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to the
Yoga of discrimination do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.
Macchittah sarvadurgaani matprasaadaat tarishyasi;
Atha chet twam ahankaaraan na shroshyasi vinangkshyasi.
58. Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt by My Grace overcome all obstacles; but if from
egoism thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.
Yadahankaaram aashritya na yotsya iti manyase;
Mithyaisha vyavasaayaste prakritistwaam niyokshyati.
59. If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest: “I will not fight”, vain is this, thy resolve; Nature
will compel thee.
Swabhaavajena kaunteya nibaddhah swena karmanaa;
Kartum necchasi yanmohaat karishyasyavasho’pi tat.
60. O Arjuna, bound by thy own Karma (action) born of thy own nature, that which from
delusion thou wishest not to do, even that thou shalt do helplessly!
COMMENTARY: Thou wilt be forced to fight because of thy nature. It will compel thee to
fight, much against thy will.
Eeshwarah sarvabhootaanaam hriddeshe’rjuna tishthati;
Bhraamayan sarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaani maayayaa.
61. The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive
power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine!
Tameva sharanam gaccha sarvabhaavena bhaarata;
Tatprasaadaatparaam shaantim sthaanam praapsyasi shaashwatam.
