  1746    Lamentations 3 
he hath made my chain heavy. 
8  Also when I cry and shout, 
he shutteth out my prayer. 
9  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone; 
 
he hath made my paths crooked. 
10  He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, 
and as a lion in secret places. 
11  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: 
 
he hath made me desolate. 
12  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 
13  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
14  I was a derision to all my people; 
 
and their song all the day. 
15  He hath filled me with bitterness, 
he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 
16  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, 
he hath covered me with ashes. 
17  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: 
 
I forgat prosperity. 
18  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord: 
 
19  remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and 
the gall. 
20  My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 
21  This I recall to my mind, 
therefore have I hope. 
22  It is of the Lordâ€™s mercies that we are not consumed, 
because his compassions fail not. 
23  They are new every morning: 
 
great is thy faithfulness. 
24  The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; 
 
therefore will I hope in him. 
25  The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, 
to the soul that seeketh him. 
26  It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the 
salvation of the Lord.
