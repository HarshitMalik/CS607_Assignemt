methods have been articulated over the centuries. Different
temperaments  and  different  times  have  different
requirements,  according  to  Taoist  teaching,  so  the
responses  of  the  Tao  to  these  varying  conditions  must
themselves  differ  to  be  effective.  This  is  the  main  reason
for  the  publication  of  a  variety  of  materials  from  this
tradition, to reflect the experiences of different people and
thereby  achieve  greater  balance  and  address  a  broader
spectrum  of  human  temperament  than  does  sectarian
dogmatics.
Besides  true  Taoist  teachings,  it  is  averred  in  the
literature,  there  are  many  false  or  deteriorated  forms  of
supposedly  Taoist  practice.  Warnings  to  this  effect  have
been circulated for many centuries. This is another reason
for the presentation of a range of traditional materials, so
that the public may have some basis for the understanding
and evaluation of particular people or practices purporting
to represent Taoism.
The  first  selection  presented  here  is  a  work  called
Anthology  on  the  Cultivation  of  Realization  by  an
unknown  author  known  only  by  the  style  Cultivator  of
Realization. Discovered in manuscript form and published
in  1739,  it  appears  to  be  a  product  of  the  Ming  dynasty
(1368â€“1644).  Citing  Taoist,  Confucian,  and  Buddhist
teachings, the author emphasizes balanced development of
the  natural,  social,  and  spiritual  elements  of  human  life
through meditations on a wide variety of topics.
