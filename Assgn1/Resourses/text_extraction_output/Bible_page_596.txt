  597    Judges 17 
26  And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me 
that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I 
may lean upon them. 
27  Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the 
 
Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three 
 
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 
28  ¶ And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, 
remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only 
this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines 
for my two eyes. 
29  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the 
house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his 
right hand, and of the other with his left. 
30  And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed 
himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and 
 
upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at 
his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
31  Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and 
took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and 
Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged 
Israel twenty years.

Micah’s Images and His Priest 
1  And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
2  And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver 
that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest 
of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his 
 
mother said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son. 
3  And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to 
his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto 
the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a 
molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
