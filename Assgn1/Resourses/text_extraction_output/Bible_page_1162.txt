  1163    Job 21 
21 
Job Asserts the Prosperity of the Wicked 
1  But Job answered and said, 
2  Hear diligently my speech, 
and let this be your consolations. 
3  Suffer me that I may speak; 
 
and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
4  As for me, is my complaint to man? 
 
And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
 
5  Mark me, and be astonished, 
and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
6  Even when I remember I am afraid, 
and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
7  Wherefore do the wicked live, 
become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
 
8  Their seed is established in their sight with them, 
and their offspring before their eyes. 
9  Their houses are safe from fear, 
neither is the rod of God upon them. 
10  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; 
 
their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
11  They send forth their little ones like a flock, 
and their children dance. 
12  They take the timbrel and harp, 
and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
13  They spend their days in wealth, 
and in a moment go down to the grave. 
14  Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; 
 
for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
15  What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? 
 
And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
 
16  Lo, their good is not in their hand: 
 
the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
