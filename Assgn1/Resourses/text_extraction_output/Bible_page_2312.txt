  2313    Acts 3 
3 
A Lame Man Healed at the Gate of the Temple 
1  Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour 
of prayer, being the ninth hour. 
2  And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, 
whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called 
Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
 
3  who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an 
alms. 
4  And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
5  And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of 
them. 
6  Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give 
 
I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
 
7  And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and 
 
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. 
8  And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into 
the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
9  And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
 
10  and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful 
gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and 
 
amazement at that which had happened unto him. 
Peter’s Address in Solomon’s Porch 
11  ¶ And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all 
the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called 
Solomon’s, greatly wondering. 
12  And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of 
Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as 
 
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to 
walk?
