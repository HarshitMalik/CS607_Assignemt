  2121    Mark 9 
Jesus Foretells His Death 
31  ¶ And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer 
many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, 
and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
32  And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to 
rebuke him. 
33  But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he 
rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest 
 
not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. 
34  ¶ And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples 
also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him 
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  
35  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall 
 
lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.  
36  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and 
lose his own soul? 
 
37  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
 
38  Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in 
this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of 
man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with 
the holy angels.

1  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of 
them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have 
seen the kingdom of God come with power. 
The Transfiguration 
2  ¶ And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and 
John, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by 
themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
