  1742    Lamentations 2 
all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; 
 
they are glad that thou hast done it: 
 
thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, 
and they shall be like unto me. 
22  Let all their wickedness come before thee; 
 
and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my 
transgressions: 
 
for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

Zionâ€™s Sorrows Come from the Lord 
1  How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in 
his anger, 
and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, 
and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! 
 
2  The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, 
and hath not pitied: 
 
he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter 
of Judah; 
 
he hath brought them down to the ground: 
 
he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. 
3  He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: 
 
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, 
and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth 
round about. 
4  He hath bent his bow like an enemy: 
 
he stood with his right hand as an adversary, 
and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the 
daughter of Zion: 
 
he poured out his fury like fire. 
5  The Lord was as an enemy: 
 
he hath swallowed up Israel, 
he hath swallowed up all her palaces:
