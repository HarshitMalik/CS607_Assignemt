  1858    Ezekiel 45 
22  Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put 
away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, 
 
or a widow that had a priest before.  
23  And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and 
profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the 
clean.  
24  And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall 
 
judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws 
 
and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my 
 
sabbaths. 
25  And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for 
 
father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for 
sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
26  And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 
27  And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner 
court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, 
saith the Lord God. 
28  ¶ And it shall be unto them for an inheritance; I am their 
 
inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am 
   
their possession.  
29  They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the 
trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
 
30  And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of 
all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest’s: ye shall also 
 
give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the 
blessing to rest in thine house.  
31  The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, 
whether it be fowl or beast.  
45 
1  Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye 
shall offer an oblation unto the Lord, a holy portion of the land: 
 
the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and
