  30    Genesis 14 
17  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth 
of it; for I will give it unto thee. 
 
18  Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of 
Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the 
Lord.

Abram Rescues Lot 
1  And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch 
king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of 
nations; 
 
2  that these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king 
of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of 
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
3  All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the 
salt sea. 
4  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year 
they rebelled. 
5  And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that 
were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and 
the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
6  and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the 
wilderness. 
7  And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and 
smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, 
that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar. 
8  And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, 
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of 
Bela, (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the 
 
vale of Siddim; 
 
9  with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of 
nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; 
 
four kings with five.
