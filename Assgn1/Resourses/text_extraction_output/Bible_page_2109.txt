  2110    Mark 5 
23  and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the 
point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she 
 
may be healed; and she shall live. 
 
24  And Jesus went with him. 
¶ And much people followed him, and thronged him. 
25  And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
26  and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all 
that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 
27  when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched 
his garment. 
28  For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 
29  And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she 
 
felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 
30  And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone 
out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched 
my clothes? 
 
31  And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude 
thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
 
32  And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 
33  But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in 
her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
34  And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; 
 
go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. 
35  ¶ While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s 
house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead; why troublest thou 
 
the Master any further? 
 
36  As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the 
ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. 
37  And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and 
John the brother of James. 
38  And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and 
seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
39  And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this 
ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
