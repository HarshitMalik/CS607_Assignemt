Jesus and Zaccheus 
1  And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 
2  And, behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, which was the chief 
among the publicans, and he was rich. 
3  And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, 
 
because he was little of stature. 
4  And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him; 
 
for he was to pass that way. 
5  And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and 
said unto him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for today I 
 
must abide at thy house. 
6  And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
7  And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was 
gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. 
8  And Zaccheus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half 
 
of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from 
 
any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. 
9  And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, 
forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
10  For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.  
The Parable of the Ten Pounds 
11  Â¶ And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, 
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that 
the kingdom of God should immediately appear. 
12  He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to 
receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
13  And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and 
said unto them, Occupy till I come. 
14  But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, 
We will not have this man to reign over us.
