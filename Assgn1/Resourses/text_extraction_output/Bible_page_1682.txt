  1683    Jeremiah 32 
39  And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the 
hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 
40  And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all 
the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse 
gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the Lord; it shall not be 
 
plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

Jeremiah Buys a Field at Anathoth 
1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year 
of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of 
Nebuchadrezzar. 
2  For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and 
 
Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which 
was in the king of Judah’s house. 
3  For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore 
dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will 
give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take 
it; 
 
4  and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the 
Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of 
Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes 
shall behold his eyes; 
 
5  and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I 
visit him, saith the Lord: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye 
 
shall not prosper? 
 
6  ¶ And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
7  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto 
thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of 
 
redemption is thine to buy it. 
8  So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the 
prison according to the word of the Lord, and said unto me, Buy 
my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of
