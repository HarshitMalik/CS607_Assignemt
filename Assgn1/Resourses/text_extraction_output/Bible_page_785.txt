  786    1 Kings 8 
49  then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy 
dwelling place, and maintain their cause, 
50  and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their 
transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and 
give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that 
they may have compassion on them: 
 
51  for they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou 
broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of 
iron: 
 
52  that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, 
and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto 
them in all that they call for unto thee. 
53  For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the 
earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses 
thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord 
God. 
54  Â¶ And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all 
this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before 
the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands 
spread up to heaven. 
55  And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud 
voice, saying, 
56  Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, 
according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of 
 
all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his 
servant.  
57  The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him 
 
not leave us, nor forsake us: 
 
58  that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, 
and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his 
judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 
59  And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication 
before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, 
that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his 
people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
