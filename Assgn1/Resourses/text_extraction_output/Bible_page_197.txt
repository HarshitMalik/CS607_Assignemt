  198    Exodus 30 
12  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their 
number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto 
the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague 
 
among them, when thou numberest them. 
13  This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are 
numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel 
 
is twenty gerahs:) a half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord. 
 
14  Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from 
twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord. 
15  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than 
half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make 
an atonement for your souls. 
16  And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, 
and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the 
congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel 
 
before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls. 
The Laver 
17  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
18  Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to 
wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the 
 
congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
19  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet 
thereat: 
 
20  when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall 
wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the 
 
altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord: 
 
21  so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and 
 
it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed 
throughout their generations. 
The Anointing Oil and the Incense 
22  ¶ Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
