  2276    John 11 
14  Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
15  And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye 
may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 
 
16  Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow 
disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
Jesus the Resurrection and the Life 
17  ¶ Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave 
four days already. 
18  Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs [or, 
about two miles] off: 
 
19  and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them 
concerning their brother. 
20  Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and 
met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 
 
21  Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my 
brother had not died. 
22  But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God 
will give it thee. 
23  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 
24  Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the 
resurrection at the last day. 
25  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that 
 
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 
 
26  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest 
thou this? 
 
27  She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the 
 
Son of God, which should come into the world. 
Jesus Weeps 
28  ¶ And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her 
sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 
29  As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
