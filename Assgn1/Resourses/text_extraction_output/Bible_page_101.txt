  102    Genesis 42 
57  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because 
 
that the famine was so sore in all lands. 
42 
Joseph’s Brethren Come to Egypt for Grain 
1  Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto 
his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
 
2  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get 
 
you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, 
 
and not die.  
3  And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
4  But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; 
 
for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
5  And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for 
 
the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
6  ¶ And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold 
to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and 
 
bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 
7  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself 
strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto 
 
them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan 
 
to buy food. 
8  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
9  And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, 
and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye 
 
are come. 
10  And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy 
servants come. 
11  We are all one man’s sons; we are true men; thy servants are no 
   
spies. 
12  And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye 
are come.
