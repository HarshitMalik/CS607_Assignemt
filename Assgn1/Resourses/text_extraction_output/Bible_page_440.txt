  441    Deuteronomy 13 
2  and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto 
thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not 
known, and let us serve them; 
 
3  thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that 
dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know 
 
whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with 
all your soul. 
4  Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his 
commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and 
cleave unto him. 
5  And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; 
 
because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, 
which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out 
of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the 
Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the 
evil away from the midst of thee. 
6  ¶ If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, 
or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, 
entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which 
thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
 
7  namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh 
unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even 
unto the other end of the earth; 
 
8  thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither 
 
shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt 
thou conceal him: 
 
9  but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to 
 
put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. 
10  And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath 
 
sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought 
thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
11  And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such 
wickedness as this is among you. 
12  ¶ If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy 
God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,
