  1828    Ezekiel 33 
15  if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk 
in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely 
 
live, he shall not die. 
16  None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto 
him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely 
   
live. 
17  ¶ Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not 
equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 
 
18  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and 
committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. 
19  But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is 
lawful and right, he shall live thereby. 
20  Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I 
will judge you every one after his ways.

tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had 
escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.  
22  Now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, afore he 
that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came 
 
to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no 
 
more dumb. 
23  ¶ Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
24  Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel 
speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we 
 
are many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
 
25  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Ye eat with 
 
the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: 
 
and shall ye possess the land? 
 
26  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile 
every one his neighbor’s wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
   
27  Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; As I live, surely 
 
they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in
