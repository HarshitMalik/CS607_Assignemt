  2442    1 Corinthians 11 
3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; 
 
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is 
 
God. 
4  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, 
dishonoreth his head. 
5  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head 
uncovered dishonoreth her head: for that is even all one as if she 
 
were shaven. 
6  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a 
 
shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 
7  For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is 
the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
 
8  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 
 
9  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for 
 
the man.  
10  For this cause ought the woman to have power [a covering, in sign 
that she is under the power of her husband] on her head because of the 
angels. 
11  Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the 
woman without the man, in the Lord. 
12  For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the 
woman; but all things of God. 
 
13  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God 
 
uncovered? 
 
14  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, 
it is a shame unto him? 
 
15  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is 
 
given her for a covering. 
16  But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, 
neither the churches of God. 
Disorder at the Lord’s Supper 
17  ¶ Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come 
together not for the better, but for the worse.
