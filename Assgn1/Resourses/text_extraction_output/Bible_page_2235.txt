  2236    Luke 23 
The Crucifixion 
26  ¶ And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a 
Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the 
cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. 
27  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, 
which also bewailed and lamented him. 
28  But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep 
not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
29  For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, 
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps 
which never gave suck. 
30  Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to 
 
the hills, Cover us.  
31  For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the 
dry? 
 
32  ¶ And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be 
put to death. 
33  And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, 
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right 
hand, and the other on the left. 
34  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they 
 
do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.  
35  And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them 
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be 
 
Christ, the chosen of God. 
36  And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering 
him vinegar, 
37  and saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself. 
38  And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, 
and Latin, and Hebrew, This is the king of the jews. 
39  ¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, 
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
40  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear 
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
