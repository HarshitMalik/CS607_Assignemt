  1430    Proverbs 16 
30  The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: 
 
and a good report maketh the bones fat. 
31  The ear that heareth the reproof of life 
abideth among the wise. 
32  He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: 
 
but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. 
33  The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; 
 
and before honor is humility.

Proverbs concerning Life and Conduct 
1  The preparations of the heart in man, 
and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord. 
2  All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; 
 
but the Lord weigheth the spirits. 
3  Commit thy works unto the Lord, 
and thy thoughts shall be established. 
4  The Lord hath made all things for himself: 
 
yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 
5  Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: 
 
though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 
6  By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: 
 
and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil. 
7  When a man’s ways please the Lord, 
he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 
8  Better is a little with righteousness, 
than great revenues without right. 
9  A man’s heart deviseth his way: 
 
but the Lord directeth his steps. 
10  A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: 
 
his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. 
11  A just weight and balance are the Lord’s: 
 
all the weights of the bag are his work.
