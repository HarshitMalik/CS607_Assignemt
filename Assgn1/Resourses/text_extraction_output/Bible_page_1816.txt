  1817    Ezekiel 29 
21  Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
22  and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O 
 
Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall 
   
know that I am the Lord, when I shall have executed judgments in 
her, and shall be sanctified in her. 
23  For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and 
 
the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon 
her on every side; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
 
24  ¶ And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of 
Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that 
despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord God. 
 
25  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; When I shall have gathered the house 
 
of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall 
be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they 
dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 
26  And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and 
plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have 
 
executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about 
them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.

Prophecies against Egypt 
1  In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the 
month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and 
prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:  
 
3  speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, 
 
Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of 
his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made 
it for myself. 
4  But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy 
rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the
