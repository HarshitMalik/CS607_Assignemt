  2361    Acts 19 
7  And all the men were about twelve. 
8  ¶ And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space 
of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning 
the kingdom of God. 
9  But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of 
that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and 
separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one 
Tyrannus. 
10  And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which 
 
dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and 
Greeks. 
11  ¶ And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
 
12  so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or 
aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits 
went out of them. 
13  Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to 
call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, 
saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
14  And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the 
priests, which did so. 
15  And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I 
know; but who are ye? 
   
16  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and 
overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of 
that house naked and wounded. 
17  And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at 
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus 
 
was magnified. 
18  And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their 
deeds. 
19  Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books 
together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the 
 
price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
20  So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
