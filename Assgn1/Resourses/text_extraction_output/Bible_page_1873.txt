  1874    Daniel 2 
and hast made known unto me now 
what we desired of thee: 
 
for thou hast now made known unto us 
the king’s matter. 
24  ¶ Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had 
ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus 
 
unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before 
   
the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation. 
25  ¶ Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said 
thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that 
will make known unto the king the interpretation. 
26  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was 
Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream 
which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? 
 
27  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret 
which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the 
astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king; 
 
28  but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh 
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. 
Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; 
 
29  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, 
what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets 
 
maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. 
30  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I 
have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make 
known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know 
the thoughts of thy heart. 
31  ¶ Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, 
whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form 
 
thereof was terrible. 
32  This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, 
his belly and his thighs of brass, 
33  his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
