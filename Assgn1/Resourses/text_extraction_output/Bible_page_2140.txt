  2141    Mark 14 
23  And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to 
them: and they all drank of it. 
 
24  And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, 
which is shed for many. 
25  Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, 
until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
Peter’s Denial Foretold 
26  ¶ And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount 
of Olives. 
27  And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me 
this night: for it is written, 
 
I will smite the shepherd, 
and the sheep shall be scattered.  
28  But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  
29  But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not 
I. 
30  And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even 
in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
31  But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will 
not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. 
Jesus Prays in Gethsemane 
32  ¶ And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he 
 
saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. 
33  And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be 
sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 
 
34  and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: 
 
tarry ye here, and watch. 
35  And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed 
that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
