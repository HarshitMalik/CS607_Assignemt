  775    1 Kings 6 
12  Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk 
in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my 
commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word 
 
with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 
 
13  and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake 
my people Israel. 
14  ¶ So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
15  And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, 
both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he 
 
covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the 
house with planks of fir. 
16  And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor 
and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, 
 
even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.  
17  And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. 
18  And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open 
flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. 
   
19  And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark 
of the covenant of the Lord. 
20  And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and 
twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: 
 
and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was 
 
of cedar. 
21  So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made 
 
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid 
 
it with gold. 
22  And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished 
all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid 
 
with gold.  
23  ¶ And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each 
ten cubits high. 
24  And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the 
other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing 
 
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
