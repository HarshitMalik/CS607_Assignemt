  2411    Romans 11 
17  So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
18  Â¶ But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, 
 
Their sound went into all the earth, 
and their words unto the ends of the world.  
19  But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, 
 
I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, 
and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  
20  But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, 
I was found of them that sought me not; 
 
I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  
21  But to Israel he saith, 
All day long I have stretched forth my hands 
unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.  
11 
The Remnant of Israel 
1  I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also 
 
am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  
2  God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not 
what the Scripture saith of Elijah? how he maketh intercession to 
 
God against Israel, saying, 
3  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, 
and digged down thine altars; 
 
and I am left alone, 
and they seek my life.  
4  But what saith the answer of God unto him? 
 
I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, 
who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.  
5  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according 
to the election of grace. 
6  And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no 
 
more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise 
 
work is no more work.
