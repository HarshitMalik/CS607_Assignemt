  2080    Matthew 25 
41  Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and 
 
the other left. 
42  Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
 
43  But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in 
what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and 
would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 
44  Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the 
 
Son of man cometh.  
The Unfaithful Servant 
45  Â¶ Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath 
made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? 
 
46  Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so 
doing. 
47  Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his 
goods. 
48  But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth 
his coming; 
 
49  and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink 
with the drunken; 
 
50  the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for 
him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 
51  and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the 
hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
 
25 
The Parable of the Ten Virgins 
1  Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, 
which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 
2  And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 
3  They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 
 
4  but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
