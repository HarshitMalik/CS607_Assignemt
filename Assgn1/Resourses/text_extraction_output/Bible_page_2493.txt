  2494    Ephesians 4 
14  that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and 
carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, 
and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 
 
15  but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, 
which is the head, even Christ: 
 
16  from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by 
that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working 
in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the 
edifying of itself in love.  
The New Life in Christ 
17  ¶ This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth 
walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
18  having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life 
of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the 
blindness of their heart: 
 
19  who being past feeling have given themselves over unto 
lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
20  But ye have not so learned Christ; 
 
21  if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the 
truth is in Jesus: 
 
22  that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, 
which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 
 
23  and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 
 
24  and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in 
righteousness and true holiness. 
25  ¶ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his 
neighbor: for we are members one of another. 
 
26  Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
   
27  neither give place to the devil. 
28  Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working 
 
with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to 
him that needeth.
