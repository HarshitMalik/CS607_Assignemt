  388    Numbers 31 
11  and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed 
her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith 
 
she bound her soul shall stand. 
12  But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he 
heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning 
 
her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her 
 
husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her. 
 
13  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband 
may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
14  But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; 
 
then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon 
her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the 
 
day that he heard them. 
15  But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard 
them; then he shall bear her iniquity. 
 
16  ¶ These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, 
between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, 
being yet in her youth in her father’s house.

Israel Takes Vengeance on Midian 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt 
 
thou be gathered unto thy people. 
3  And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves 
unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge 
the Lord of Midian. 
4  Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall 
ye send to the war. 
5  So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand 
of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
