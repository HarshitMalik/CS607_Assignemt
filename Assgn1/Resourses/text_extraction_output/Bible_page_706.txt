  707    2 Samuel 6 
2  And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him 
from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose 
name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth 
between the cherubim.  
3  And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of 
the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the 
 
sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
4  And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at 
Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the 
 
ark. 
5  And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all

breach of Uzzah] to this day. 
9  And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the 
ark of the Lord come to me?

city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-
 
edom the Gittite. 
11  And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obed-edom the 
Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obed-edom, and all his 
 
household.  
The Ark Brought to Jerusalem 
12  ¶ And it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the 
house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of
