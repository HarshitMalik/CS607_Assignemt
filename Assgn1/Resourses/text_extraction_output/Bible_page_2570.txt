  2571    Hebrews 12 
9  Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, 
and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in 
 
subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of

though he sought it carefully with tears.

tempest, 
19  and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice 
 
they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to 
them any more:  
 
20  (for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so 
much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust 
through with a dart:
