  1278    Psalms 61 
11  Give us help from trouble: 
 
for vain is the help of man. 
12  Through God we shall do valiantly: 
 
for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. 
61 
Confidence in God’s Protection 
To the chief Musician upon Neginah,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Hear my cry, O God; 
 
attend unto my prayer. 
2  From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, 
when my heart is overwhelmed. 
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I; 
 
3  for thou hast been a shelter for me, 
and a strong tower from the enemy. 
4  I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: 
 
I will trust in the covert of thy wings. 
Selah. 
5  For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: 
 
thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
6  Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: 
 
and his years as many generations. 
7  He shall abide before God for ever: 
 
O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 
8  So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, 
that I may daily perform my vows.
