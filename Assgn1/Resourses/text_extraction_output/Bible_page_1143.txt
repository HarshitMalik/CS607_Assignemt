  1144    Job 9 
17  For he breaketh me with a tempest, 
and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
18  He will not suffer me to take my breath, 
but filleth me with bitterness. 
19  If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: 
 
and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? 
 
20  If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: 
 
if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 
21  Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: 
 
I would despise my life. 
22  This is one thing, therefore I said it, 
He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
23  If the scourge slay suddenly, 
he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
24  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: 
 
he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; 
 
if not, where, and who is he? 
 
25  Now my days are swifter than a post: 
 
they flee away, they see no good. 
26  They are passed away as the swift ships: 
 
as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 
27  If I say, I will forget my complaint, 
I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself; 
 
28  I am afraid of all my sorrows, 
I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 
29  If I be wicked, 
why then labor I in vain? 
 
30  If I wash myself with snow water, 
and make my hands never so clean; 
 
31  yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, 
and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 
32  For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, 
and we should come together in judgment. 
33  Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, 
that might lay his hand upon us both.
