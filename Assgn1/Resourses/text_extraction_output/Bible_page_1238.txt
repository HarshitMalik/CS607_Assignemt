  1239    Psalms 33 
Selah. 
8  I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: 
 
I will guide thee with mine eye. 
9  Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, 
which have no understanding: 
 
whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, 
lest they come near unto thee. 
10  Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: 
 
but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. 
11  Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: 
 
and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. 
33 
Praise to the Creator and Preserver 
1  Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: 
 
for praise is comely for the upright. 
2  Praise the Lord with harp: 
 
sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 
3  Sing unto him a new song; 
 
play skilfully with a loud noise. 
4  For the word of the Lord is right; 
 
and all his works are done in truth. 
5  He loveth righteousness and judgment: 
 
the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. 
6  By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; 
 
and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
7  He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: 
 
he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 
8  Let all the earth fear the Lord: 
 
let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
9  For he spake, and it was done; 
 
he commanded, and it stood fast. 
10  The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought:
