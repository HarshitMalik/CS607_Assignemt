  561    Judges 4 
24  ¶ When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw 
 
that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely 
he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
25  And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened 
 
not the doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened 
 
them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. 
 
26  ¶ And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the 
quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
27  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in 
the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down 
with him from the mount, and he before them. 
28  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath 
 
delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they 
went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, 
and suffered not a man to pass over. 
29  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all 
lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man. 
 
30  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the 
land had rest fourscore years. 
Shamgar Delivers Israel from the Philistines 
31  ¶ And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the 
Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also delivered 
 
Israel.

Deborah and Barak Defeat Sisera 
1  And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, 
when Ehud was dead. 
2  And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, 
that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which 
 
dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
