  462    Deuteronomy 23 
27  for he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and 
there was none to save her. 
28  ¶ If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and 
lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
 
29  then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father 
fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath 
 
humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.  
30  ¶ A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s 
skirt.  
23 
Those Excluded from the Congregation 
1  He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, 
shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord. 
2  ¶ A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even 
 
to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of 
the Lord. 
3  ¶ An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation 
of the Lord; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter 
 
into the congregation of the Lord for ever: 
 
4  because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, 
when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against 
 
thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse 
thee.  
5  Nevertheless, the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; 
 
but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, 
because the Lord thy God loved thee.  
6  Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for 
ever. 
7  ¶ Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt 
   
not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. 
 
8  The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the 
congregation of the Lord in their third generation.
