Prays Nanak, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the whole world is 
false.  || 1 ||   O king, why are you asleep? Why don‟t you wake up to reality? It is 
useless to cry and whine about Maya, but so many weep and wail. So many weep and 
wail for Maya, the great enticer, but without the Name of the Lord, there is no peace. 
Thousands of clever tricks and efforts will not succeed. They go wherever the Lord wills 
them  to  go.  In  the  beginning,  in  the  end,  and  in  the  middle,  He  is  all-pervading 
everywhere; He is in  each  and every  heart. Prays Nanak, those who join the Saadh 
Sangat go to the house of the Lord with honor.  || 2 ||   O king of the people, you know 
your palaces and wise servants? You shall certainly have to separate from them; your 
attachment  to  them  will  cause  you  to  regret.  Beholding the phantom city, you  have 
gone astray; how can you find stability now? Absorbed in things other than the Name of 
the Lord, this human life is wasted in vain. Indulging in egotistical actions, your thirst is 
not quenched. Your desires are not fulfilled, and you do not attain spiritual wisdom. 
Prays Nanak, without the Name of the Lord, many have departed with regret.  || 3 ||   
Showering His blessings, the Lord has made me His own. Grasping my arm, He has 
pulled me out of the mud, and blessed me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the 
Holy. Worshipping the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, all my sins and sufferings are burnt 
away. This is the greatest religion, and the best act of charity; this alone shall go along 
with you. My tongue chants in adoration the Name of the One Lord and Master; my 
mind and body are drenched in the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, whoever the Lord unites 
with Himself, is filled with all virtues.  || 4 || 6 || 9 ||    
 
VAAR OF BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
SHALOK,  THIRD  MEHL:  By serving the Guru, peace is obtained; do not search for 
peace anywhere else. The mind is pierced by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; it dwells 
with the Lord forever. O Nanak, they alone obtain the Naam, whom the Lord beholds 
with His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  The treasure of God‟s Praise is such a 
blessed gift; it is used and spent by those to whom the Lord gives it. Without the True 
Guru, it does not come to hand; all have grown weary of performing religious rituals. O 
Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs of the world lack this wealth; when they are hungry in 
the next world, what will they have to eat there?  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  All are Yours — 
You belong to all. You created all. You are pervading within all — all meditate on You. 
You accept the devotional worship of those who are pleasing to Your Mind. Whatever 
pleases the Lord God happens; all act as You cause them to act. Praise the Lord, the 
greatest of all; He preserves the honor of the humble Saints.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD 
MEHL:    O  Nanak,  the  spiritually  wise  have  conquered  the  world,  but  the  world  has 
conquered  everyone.  Through  the  Name,  their  affairs  are  brought  to  perfection; 
whatever will be, will be. Under Guru‟s Instruction, their minds are held steady; no one 
can make them waver.
