  883    2 Kings 19 
19 
Judah Delivered from Sennacherib 
1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his 
clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the 
house of the Lord. 
2  And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna 
the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to 
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
3  And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of 
trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to 
 
the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 
4  It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, 
whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the 
living God; and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God 
 
hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are 
 
left. 
5  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
6  And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus 
saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, 
with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed 
me. 
7  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, 
and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the 
 
sword in his own land. 
8  Â¶ So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring 
against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from 
 
Lachish. 
9  And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is 
come out to fight against thee; he sent messengers again unto 
 
Hezekiah, saying, 
10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy 
God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall 
not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
