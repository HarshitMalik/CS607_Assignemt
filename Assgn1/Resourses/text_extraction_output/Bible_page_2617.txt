  2618    Revelation 2 
have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will 
 
give thee a crown of life. 
11  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second 
 
death.  
The Message to Pergamos 
12  ¶ And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things 
 
saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges. 
13  ¶ I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s 
seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my 
 
faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, 
who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
14  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them 
that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a 
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed 
unto idols, and to commit fornication.  
15  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, 
which thing I hate. 
16  Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against 
 
them with the sword of my mouth. 
17  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden 
 
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new 
name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. 
The Message to Thyatira 
18  ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things 
 
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, 
and his feet are like fine brass. 
19  ¶ I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy 
patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
