  2234    Luke 23 
70  Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto 
 
them, Ye say that I am. 
71  And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves 
 
have heard of his own mouth.

Jesus before Pilate 
1  And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
2  And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow 
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, 
saying that he himself is Christ a king. 
3  And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And 
 
he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. 
4  Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault 
in this man. 
5  And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, 
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 
Jesus before Herod 
6  ¶ When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a 
Galilean. 
7  And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, 
he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that 
time. 
8  And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was 
 
desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many 
things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by 
 
him. 
9  Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him 
 
nothing. 
10  And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused 
him.
