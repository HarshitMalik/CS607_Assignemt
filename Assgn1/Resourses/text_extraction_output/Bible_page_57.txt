  58    Genesis 26 
and the elder shall serve the younger.  
24  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were 
twins in her womb. 
25  And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they 
 
called his name Esau. 
26  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on 
Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore 
   
years old when she bare them. 
Esau Sells His Birthright 
27  ¶ And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the 
 
field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
 
28  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but 
 
Rebekah loved Jacob. 
29  ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was 
 
faint: 
 
30  and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red 
pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom [red]. 
   
31  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
32  And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit 
 
shall this birthright do to me? 
 
33  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and 
   
he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
34  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat 
 
and drink, and rose up, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his 
birthright.

1  And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that 
was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king 
of the Philistines unto Gerar.
