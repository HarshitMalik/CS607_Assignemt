  804    1 Kings 14 
9  but hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast 
 
gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me 
to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
 
10  therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, 
and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, 
and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the 
remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till 
it be all gone. 
11  Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him 
 
that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the Lord 
 
hath spoken it. 
12  Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy 
 
feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 
13  And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of 
 
Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found 
some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of 
Jeroboam. 
14  Moreover the Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall 
cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 
   
15  For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, 
and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to 
their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they 
have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger. 
16  And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did 
sin, and who made Israel to sin. 
17  ¶ And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: 
 
and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 
 
18  and they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to 
 
the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of his servant 
Ahijah the prophet. 
19  And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he 
reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of 
the kings of Israel.
