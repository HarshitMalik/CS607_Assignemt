  47    Genesis 22 
29  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe 
lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
 
30  And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, 
that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
31  Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba [the well of the oath]; 
 
because there they sware both of them. 
32  Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, 
 
and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into 
the land of the Philistines. 
33  And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the 
name of the Lord, the everlasting God. 
34  And Abraham sojourned in the Philistinesâ€™ land many days.

Abraham Commanded to Offer Isaac 
1  And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt 
Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I 
 
am. 
2  And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou 
lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for 
 
a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee 
of. 
3  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, 
and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and 
clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto 
the place of which God had told him. 
4  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place 
afar off. 
5  And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; 
 
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to 
you.
