  299    Leviticus 27 
28  ¶ Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto 
the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field 
of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is 
 
most holy unto the Lord. 
29  None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; 
 
but shall surely be put to death. 
30  ¶ And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of 
the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s: it is holy unto the Lord. 
 
31  And if a man will at all redeem aught of his tithes, he shall add 
thereto the fifth part thereof. 
32  And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of 
whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the 
Lord. 
33  He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he 
change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change 
 
thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.  
 
34  ¶ These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded 
Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
