  1297    Psalms 73 
who prosper in the world; 
 
they increase in riches. 
13  Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, 
and washed my hands in innocency. 
14  For all the day long have I been plagued, 
and chastened every morning. 
15  If I say, I will speak thus; 
 
behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. 
16  When I thought to know this, 
it was too painful for me; 
 
17  until I went into the sanctuary of God; 
 
then understood I their end. 
18  Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: 
 
thou castedst them down into destruction. 
19  How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! 
 
They are utterly consumed with terrors. 
20  As a dream when one awaketh; 
 
so, O Lord, when thou awakest, 
thou shalt despise their image. 
21  Thus my heart was grieved, 
and I was pricked in my reins. 
22  So foolish was I, and ignorant: 
 
I was as a beast before thee. 
23  Nevertheless I am continually with thee: 
 
thou hast holden me by my right hand. 
24  Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, 
and afterward receive me to glory. 
25  Whom have I in heaven but thee? 
 
And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. 
26  My flesh and my heart faileth: 
 
but God is the strength of my heart, 
and my portion for ever. 
27  For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: 
 
thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. 
28  But it is good for me to draw near to God:
