  2603    1 John 3 
8  He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from 
 
the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, 
that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
9  Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed 
 
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
 
10  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he 
 
that loveth not his brother. 
Love One Another 
11  ¶ For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we 
should love one another.  
12  Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And 
wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his 
 
brother’s righteous. 
13  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
14  We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love 
the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 
15  Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no 
 
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
16  Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for 
us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
 
17  But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, 
and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth 
the love of God in him? 
 
18  My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in 
 
deed and in truth. 
19  ¶ And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our 
hearts before him. 
20  For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and 
knoweth all things. 
21  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence 
toward God.
