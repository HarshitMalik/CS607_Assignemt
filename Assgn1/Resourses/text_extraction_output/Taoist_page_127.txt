SAYINGS OF TAOIST MASTER
DANYANG
SELF-ENLIGHTENMENT
Learning  the  Way  is  a  matter  of  self-enlightenment.
Failure to realize enlightenment is caused by ignorance.
If you want to break through ignorance, first clean your
mind.
This  is  a  matter  of  purifying  and  calming  it  until  it  is
perfectly clear.
When you succeed at this you attain fulfillment. You do
not necessarily need to ask another for instruction.
