  250    Leviticus 11 
3  Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth 
the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 
4  Nevertheless, these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of 
them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the 
 
cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
 
5  And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the 
hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
 
6  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the 
hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
 
7  And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven-footed, 
yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. 
 
8  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; 
 
they are unclean to you. 
9  ¶ These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath 
 
fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them 
shall ye eat. 
10  And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of 
all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the 
waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 
 
11  they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of 
 
their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination. 
12  Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an 
abomination unto you. 
13  ¶ And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the 
fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, 
   
and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
14  and the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
 
15  every raven after his kind; 
 
16  and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk 
after his kind, 
17  and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 
18  and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, 
19  and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the 
bat.
