  894    2 Kings 23 
8  And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled 
the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to 
Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in 
the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which 
were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city. 
9  Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar 
of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread 
among their brethren. 
10  And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of 
Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass 
through the fire to Molech.  
11  And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to 
the sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord, by the 
chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the 
suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 
12  And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, 
which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh 
had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king 
beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of 
them into the brook Kidron. 
13  And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the 
right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of 
Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, 
and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for 
Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king 
defile.  
14  And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and 
filled their places with the bones of men. 
15  ¶ Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both 
that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high 
place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. 
16  And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were 
there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the 
sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it,
