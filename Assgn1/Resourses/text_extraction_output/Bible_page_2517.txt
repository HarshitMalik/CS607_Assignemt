  2518    1 Thessalonians 3 
13  ¶ For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when 
ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not 
as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which 
effectually worketh also in you that believe. 
14  For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in 
Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of 
 
your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 
 
15  who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have 
persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all 
 
men: 
 
16  forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to 
fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the 
 
uttermost. 
Paul’s Absence and Concern 
17  ¶ But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in 
presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your 
face with great desire. 
18  Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and 
again; but Satan hindered us. 
 
19  For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye 
 
in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 
 
20  For ye are our glory and joy. 
3 
1  Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to 
be left at Athens alone;  
 
2  and sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow 
laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you 
concerning your faith: 
 
3  that no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves 
 
know that we are appointed thereunto.
