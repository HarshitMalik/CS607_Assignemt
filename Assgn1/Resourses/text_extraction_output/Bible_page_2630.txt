  2631    Revelation 11 
4  And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about 
to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up 
 
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them 
not. 
5  And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth 
lifted up his hand to heaven, 
6  and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, 
and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that 
therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that 
there should be time no longer: 
 
7  but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall 
begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath 
declared to his servants the prophets.  
8  ¶ And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, 
and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of 
the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 
9  And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little 
book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make 
 
thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. 
10  And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and 
 
it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, 
 
my belly was bitter.  
11  And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many 
peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

The Two Witnesses 
1  And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, 
 
saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and 
them that worship therein. 
2  But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it 
not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they 
   
tread under foot forty and two months.
