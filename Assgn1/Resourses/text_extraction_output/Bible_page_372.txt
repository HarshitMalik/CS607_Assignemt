25  ¶ And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and 
 
Balak also went his way.

Israel Worships Baal-peor 
1  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit 
whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 
2  And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the 
 
people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
3  And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the 
 
Lord was kindled against Israel. 
4  And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, 
and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce 
anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. 
5  And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men 
that were joined unto Baal-peor. 
6  ¶ And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto 
his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the 
sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were 
weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
7  And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, 
saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin 
in his hand; 
 
8  and he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of 
them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. 
So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
9  And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
10  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
11  Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath 
turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was 
zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children 
of Israel in my jealousy. 
12  Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
