  1634    Jeremiah 10 
7  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it 
 
appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and 
 
in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee. 
8  But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine 
 
of vanities. 
9  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from 
Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: 
 
blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning 
 
men. 
10  But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an 
everlasting King: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the 
 
nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. 
11  ¶ Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the 
heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and 
from under these heavens. 
12  ¶ He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the 
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his 
discretion. 
13  When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the 
heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the 
earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind 
 
out of his treasures. 
14  Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is 
 
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, 
 
and there is no breath in them. 
15  They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their 
 
visitation they shall perish. 
16  The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all 
 
things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is 
   
his name. 
The Desolation of Judah 
17  ¶ Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
