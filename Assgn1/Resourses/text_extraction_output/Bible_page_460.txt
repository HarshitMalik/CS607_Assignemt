  461    Deuteronomy 22 
15  then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring 
forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in 
the gate: 
 
16  and the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my 
daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 
 
17  and, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I 
found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my 
 
daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the 
elders of the city. 
18  And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; 
 
19  and they shall amerce him in a hundred shekels of silver, and give 
them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an 
evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may 
   
not put her away all his days. 
20  But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for 
the damsel: 
 
21  then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s 
house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she 
die; because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in 
 
her father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. 
 
22  ¶ If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, 
then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the 
woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. 
 
23  ¶ If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband, and a 
man find her in the city, and lie with her; 
 
24  then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye 
shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she 
 
cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled 
 
his neighbor’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. 
 
25  ¶ But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man 
force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her 
 
shall die: 
 
26  but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no 
 
sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, 
 
and slayeth him, even so is this matter:
