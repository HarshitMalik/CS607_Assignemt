  857    2 Kings 10 
34  And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see 
now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter. 
 
35  And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the 
 
skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. 
36  Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the 
word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the 
Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of 
Jezebel:  
 
37  And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field 
in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

Jehu Destroys the House of Ahab 
1  And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and 
sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to 
them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying, 
2  Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons 
are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced 
city also, and armor; 
 
3  look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set 
him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house. 
4  But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood 
not before him: how then shall we stand? 
   
5  And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the 
elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, 
We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will 
 
not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes. 
 
6  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be 
mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the 
men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow 
this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the 
great men of the city, which brought them up.
