  2257    John 6 
3  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his 
disciples. 
4  And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
5  When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come 
unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that 
these may eat? 
 
6  And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would

with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over 
and above unto them that had eaten.
