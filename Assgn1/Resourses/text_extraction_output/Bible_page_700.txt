  701    2 Samuel 3 
19  And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also 
 
to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to 
Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 
20  ¶ So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. 
And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 
21  And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all 
Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with 
thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. 
And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. 
 
Joab Kills Abner 
22  ¶ And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a 
troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not 
 
with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone 
 
in peace. 
23  When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told 
Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath 
sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 
24  Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? 
 
behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him 
 
away, and he is quite gone? 
 
25  Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, 
and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that 
thou doest. 
26  ¶ And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers 
after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but 
 
David knew it not. 
27  And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in 
the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the 
fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. 
28  And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are 
guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son 
of Ner.
