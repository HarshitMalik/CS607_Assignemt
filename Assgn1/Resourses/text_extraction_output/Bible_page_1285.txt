  1286    Psalms 68 
68 
The God of Sinai and of the Sanctuary 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm or Song of David. 
1  Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: 
 
let them also that hate him flee before him. 
2  As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: 
 
as wax melteth before the fire, 
so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
3  But let the righteous be glad; 
 
let them rejoice before God: 
 
yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. 
4  Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: 
 
extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, 
and rejoice before him. 
5  A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, 
is God in his holy habitation. 
6  God setteth the solitary in families: 
 
he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: 
 
but the rebellious dwell in a dry land. 
7  O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, 
when thou didst march through the wilderness; 
 
Selah. 
8  The earth shook, the heavens also dropped 
at the presence of God: 
 
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
9  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, 
whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, 
when it was weary. 
10  Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: 
 
thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. 
11  The Lord gave the word:
