  1936    Amos 5 
4  ¶ For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and 
ye shall live: 
 
5  but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-
sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall 
 
come to nought. 
6  Seek the Lord, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the 
 
house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in 
Beth-el. 
7  Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness 
in the earth, 
8  seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the 
shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with 
night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out 
 
upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name: 
   
9  that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the 
spoiled shall come against the fortress. 
10  ¶ They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that 
speaketh uprightly. 
11  Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take 
from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, 
 
but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, 
 
but ye shall not drink wine of them. 
12  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: 
 
they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor 
in the gate from their right. 
13  Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an 
 
evil time. 
14  ¶ Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord, the 
 
God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. 
15  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the 
gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the 
 
remnant of Joseph. 
16  ¶ Therefore the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; 
 
Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways,
