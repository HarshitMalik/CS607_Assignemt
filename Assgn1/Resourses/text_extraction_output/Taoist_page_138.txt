spontaneously  produces  white,  fire  erupts  in  water,  and
warm energy circulates in the cavern of energy. This is the
initial  movement  of  true  yang,  producing  being  from
nonbeing.”
He also said, “The forging and refining of wind and fire
must be applied to pure yang to activate the yang energy.
This  is  all  a  matter  of  discovering  and  consciously
nurturing  the  basic  spirit,  a  point  of  empty  nothingness,
storing  it  down  in  the  cavern  of  energy.  This  is  called
sending it back to the earth pot and sealing it tightly.
“With the ethereal spiritual light of essence of the basic
spirit  within,  be  like  a  turtle  hiding,  like  a  snake
hibernating; do not forget, do not force, as if present yet as
if  absent.  Eventually  exhalation  and  inhalation  will  join,
spirit  and  energy  will  embrace,  the  mystic  pass  will
naturally  open,  and  the  seed  of  realization  will  be
produced.”
