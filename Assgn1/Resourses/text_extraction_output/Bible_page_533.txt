of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns, and they 
who are of the valley of Jezreel. 
17  And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to 
Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: 
 
thou shalt not have one lot only: 
 
18  but the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut 
 
it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive 
   
out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though 
they be strong.

The Territory Allotted to the Other Tribes 
1  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled 
together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation 
there: and the land was subdued before them. 
 
2  Â¶ And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, 
which had not yet received their inheritance. 
3  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack 
to go to possess the land, which the Lord God of your fathers hath 
given you? 
 
4  Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send 
 
them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it 
according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to 
 
me. 
5  And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their 
 
coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their 
coasts on the north. 
6  Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the 
description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the 
Lord our God. 
7  But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the 
 
Lord is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe
