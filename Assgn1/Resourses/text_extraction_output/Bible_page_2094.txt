  2095    Matthew 28 
8  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great 
joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
 
9  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, 
saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and 
worshipped him. 
10  Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that 
 
they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 
The Report of the Guard 
11  ¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into 
the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were 
done. 
12  And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken 
counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
13  saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away 
while we slept. 
14  And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and 
secure you. 
15  So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this 
 
saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. 
Jesus Commissions the Eleven 
16  ¶ Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a 
mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
17  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 
 
18  And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given 
unto me in heaven and in earth. 
19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 
 
20  teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded 
you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. 
 
Amen.
