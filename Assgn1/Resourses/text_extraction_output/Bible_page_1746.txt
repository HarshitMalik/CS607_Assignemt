  1747    Lamentations 3 
27  It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
28  He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, 
because he hath borne it upon him. 
29  He putteth his mouth in the dust; 
 
if so be there may be hope. 
30  He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: 
 
he is filled full with reproach. 
31  For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 
 
32  but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion 
according to the multitude of his mercies. 
33  For he doth not afflict willingly, 
nor grieve the children of men. 
34  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 
35  to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 
36  to subvert a man in his cause, 
the Lord approveth not. 
37  Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, 
when the Lord commandeth it not? 
 
38  Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good? 
 
39  Wherefore doth a living man complain, 
a man for the punishment of his sins? 
 
40  Let us search and try our ways, 
and turn again to the Lord. 
41  Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 
42  We have transgressed and have rebelled: 
 
thou hast not pardoned. 
43  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: 
 
thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 
44  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, 
that our prayer should not pass through. 
45  Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the 
people. 
46  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
47  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 
48  Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water
