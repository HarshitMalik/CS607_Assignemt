The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Hebrews 
[Hebrews] 
1 
God Has Spoken by His Son 
1  God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past 
unto the fathers by the prophets, 
2  hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath 
appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 
 
3  who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his 
person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when 
he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of 
the Majesty on high; 
 
4  being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by 
inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. 
The Son Superior to Angels 
5  Â¶ For unto which of the angels said he at any time, 
Thou art my Son, 
this day have I begotten thee? 
 
And again, 
I will be to him a Father, 
and he shall be to me a Son? 
 
6  And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, 
he saith, 
And let all the angels of God worship him.  
7  And of the angels he saith, 
Who maketh his angels spirits, 
and his ministers a flame of fire.  
8  But unto the Son he saith, 
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
