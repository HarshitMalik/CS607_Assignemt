  256    Leviticus 13 
25  then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the 
 
bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; 
 
it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall 
 
pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 
 
26  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the 
bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat 
dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 
   
27  and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be 
 
spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 
 
28  And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, 
but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest 
 
shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the 
 
burning. 
29  Â¶ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 
 
30  then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight 
 
deeper than the skin, and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the 
 
priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy 
 
upon the head or beard. 
31  And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be 
not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in 
it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall 
 
seven days: 
 
32  and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, 
 
behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and 
the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin; 
 
33  he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest 
 
shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more: 
 
34  and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, 
 
behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper 
than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he 
   
shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
35  But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 
 
36  then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread 
 
in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.
