  928    1 Chronicles 10 
33  ¶ And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who 
remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that 
 
work day and night. 
34  These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their 
generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. 
 
The Genealogy of Saul 
35  ¶ And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s 
name was Maachah: 
 
36  and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and 
Ner, and Nadab, 
37  and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
38  And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their 
brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren. 
39  And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, 
   
and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal. 
40  And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat 
 
Micah. 
41  And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and 
Ahaz. 
42  And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, 
 
and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 
   
43  and Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel 
 
his son. 
44  And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, 
and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. These were 
the sons of Azel.
