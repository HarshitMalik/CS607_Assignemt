  1972    Habakkuk 3 
15  Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, 
through the heap of great waters. 
16  When I heard, my belly trembled; 
 
my lips quivered at the voice: 
 
rottenness entered into my bones, 
and I trembled in myself, 
that I might rest in the day of trouble: 
 
when he cometh up unto the people, 
he will invade them with his troops. 
17  Although the fig tree shall not blossom, 
neither shall fruit be in the vines; 
 
the labor of the olive shall fail, 
and the fields shall yield no meat; 
 
the flock shall be cut off from the fold, 
and there shall be no herd in the stalls: 
 
18  yet I will rejoice in the Lord, 
I will joy in the God of my salvation. 
19  The Lord God is my strength, 
and he will make my feet like hindsâ€™ feet,  
and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. 
To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
