  1121    Esther 6 
9  ¶ Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: 
 
but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood 
not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against 
Mordecai. 
10  Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, 
 
he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. 
11  And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude 
of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted 
him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants 
of the king. 
12  Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come 
in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but 
myself; and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king. 
 
13  Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew 
sitting at the king’s gate. 
14  Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a 
gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou 
unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou 
 
in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased 
Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

Haman Forced to Honor Mordecai 
1  On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring 
the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the 
 
king. 
2  And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and 
Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, 
who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.  
3  And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to 
Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered 
 
unto him, There is nothing done for him.
