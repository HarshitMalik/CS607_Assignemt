BHAGAVAD GITA
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Etacchrutwaa vachanam keshavasya
Kritaanjalirvepamaanah kireetee;
Namaskritwaa bhooya evaaha krishnam
Sagadgadam bheetabheetah pranamya.
Sanjaya said:
35. Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, the crowned one (Arjuna), with joined palms,
trembling, prostrating himself, again addressed Krishna, in a choked voice, bowing down,
overwhelmed with fear.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Sthaane hrisheekesha tava prakeertyaa
Jagat prahrishyatyanurajyate cha;
Rakshaamsi bheetaani disho dravanti
Sarve namasyanti cha siddhasanghaah.
Arjuna said:
36. It is meet, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Thy praise; demons fly in
fear to all quarters and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to Thee!
Kasmaachcha te na nameran mahaatman
Gareeyase brahmano’pyaadikartre;
Ananta devesha jagannivaasa
Twamaksharam sadasattatparam yat.
37. And why should they not, O great soul, bow to Thee who art greater (than all else), the
primal cause even of (Brahma) the creator, O Infinite Being! O Lord of the gods! O abode of the
universe! Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme (that
which is beyond the Being and non-being).
COMMENTARY: The Lord is Mahatma. He is greater than all else. He is the
imperishable, so He is the proper object of worship, love and delight.
Twamaadidevah purushah puraanas
Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam;
Vettaasi vedyam cha param cha dhaama
Twayaa tatam vishwamanantaroopa.
38. Thou art the primal God, the ancient Purusha, the supreme refuge of this universe, the
knower, the knowable and the supreme abode. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O Being of
infinite forms!
