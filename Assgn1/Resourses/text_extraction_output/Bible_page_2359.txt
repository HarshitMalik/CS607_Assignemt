  2360    Acts 19 
Apollos Preaches at Ephesus 
24  ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an 
eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
25  This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent 
 
in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, 
knowing only the baptism of John. 
26  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when 
 
Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and 
expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
27  And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, 
exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, 
 
helped them much which had believed through grace: 
 
28  for he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by 
the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

Paul at Ephesus 
1  And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul 
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus; and 
 
finding certain disciples, 
2  he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye 
believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard 
 
whether there be any Holy Ghost. 
3  And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And 
 
they said, Unto John’s baptism. 
4  Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of 
repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on 
him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  
5  When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord 
Jesus. 
6  And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came 
on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
