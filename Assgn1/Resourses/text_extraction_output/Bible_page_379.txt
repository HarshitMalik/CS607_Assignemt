  380    Numbers 27 
5  ¶ And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. 
6  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
7  The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give 
 
them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; 
 
and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto 
them.  
8  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man 
die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass 
unto his daughter. 
9  And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his brethren. 
10  And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his father’s brethren. 
11  And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his 
inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and 
he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a 
 
statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
Moses Appoints Joshua as His Successor 
12  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount 
Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of 
Israel. 
13  And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy 
people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 
14  For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in 
the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before 
their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness 
 
of Zin. 
15  And Moses spake unto the Lord, saying, 
16  Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the 
congregation, 
17  which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, 
and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
