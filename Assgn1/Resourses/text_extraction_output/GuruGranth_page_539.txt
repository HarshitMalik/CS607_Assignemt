Nanak has found peace, meditating on the Lord, O my soul; the Lord is the Destroyer of 
all pain.  || 1 ||   Blessed, blessed is that tongue, O my soul, which sings the Glorious 
Praises of the Lord God. Sublime and splendid are those ears, O my soul, which listen to 
the Kirtan of the Your Praises, O Lord. Sublime, pure and sacred is that head, O my 
soul, which falls at the Guru‟s feet. Nanak is a sacrifice to the Guru, O my soul, who has 
placed the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in my consciousness.  || 2 ||   Blessed and 
approved are those eyes, O my soul, which gaze upon the Holy True Guru. Sacred and 
pure  are  those  hands,  O  my  soul,  which  write  the  Praises  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har.  I 
worship continually the feet of that humble being, O my soul, who walks on the Path of 
Dharma, the path of righteousness. Nanak is a sacrifice to those, O my soul, who hear 
of the Lord, and believe in the Lord‟s Name.  || 3 ||   The earth, the nether regions of 
the underworld, and the Akaashic ethers, O my soul, all meditate on the Name of the 
Lord, Har, Har. Wind, water and fire, O my soul, continually sing the Praises of the Lord, 
Har, Har, Har. The woods, the meadows and the whole creation, O my soul, meditate 
with their mouths on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, one who, as Gurmukh, 
focuses  his  consciousness  on  the  Lord‟s  devotional  worship,  O  my  soul,  is  robed  in 
honor in the Court of the Lord.  || 4 || 4 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those who 
do  not  remember  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har,  O  my  soul  —  those  self-willed 
manmukhs are foolish and ignorant. Those who attach their consciousness to emotional 
attachment and Maya, O my soul, depart regretfully in the end. They find no place of 
rest in the Court of the Lord, O my soul; those self-willed manmukhs are lured by sin. O 
servant Nanak, those who meet the Guru are saved, O my soul; chanting the Name of 
the Lord, they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   Go, everyone, and meet 
the True Guru, O my soul; He implants the Name of the Lord, Har, har, within. Do not 
hesitate for an instant — meditate on the Lord, O my soul; who knows whether or not 
you shall draw another breath? That time, that moment, that instant, that second is so 
fruitful, O my soul, when the Lord comes into my consciousness. Servant Nanak has 
meditated on the Naam, O my soul, and now, the Messenger of Death does not even 
approach him.  || 2 ||   The Lord continually watches and hears everything, O my soul; 
only those who commit sins are afraid. Those whose hearts are pure within, O my soul, 
cast off all their fears.
