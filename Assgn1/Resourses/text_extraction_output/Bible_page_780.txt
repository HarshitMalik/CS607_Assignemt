  781    1 Kings 8 
47  And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were 
exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. 
 
48  ¶ And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of 
the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the 
 
showbread was,  
49  and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on 
the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the 
tongs of gold, 
50  and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and 
the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of 
 
the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, 
to wit, of the temple. 
51  ¶ So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house 
of the Lord. And Solomon brought in the things which David his 
father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, 
 
did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord.

Solomon Brings the Ark into the Temple 
1  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of 
the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto 
king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the 
covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. 
2  And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon 
at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
3  And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
4  And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, 
even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. 
5  And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were 
assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing 
sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for 
multitude.
