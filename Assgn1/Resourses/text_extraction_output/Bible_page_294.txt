  295    Leviticus 26 
26  And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall 
bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread 
again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 
 
27  ¶ And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary 
unto me; 
 
28  then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will 
 
chastise you seven times for your sins. 
29  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your 
daughters shall ye eat. 
30  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and 
cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul 
shall abhor you. 
31  And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto 
desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. 
32  And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which 
 
dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 
33  And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a 
sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities 
 
waste. 
34  ¶ Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, 
and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and 
 
enjoy her sabbaths. 
35  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in 
 
your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
36  And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into 
their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a 
 
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a 
 
sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 
 
37  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, 
when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before 
 
your enemies. 
38  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your 
enemies shall eat you up.
