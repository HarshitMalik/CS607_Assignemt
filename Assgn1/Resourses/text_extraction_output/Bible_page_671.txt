  672    1 Samuel 22 
3  ¶ And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the 
 
king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come 
forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. 
4  And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with 
 
him all the while that David was in the hold. 
5  And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; 
 
depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, 
and came into the forest of Hareth. 
Saul Kills the Priests of Nob 
6  ¶ When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that 
were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, 
having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing 
about him;) 
 
7  then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye 
Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and 
 
vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of 
hundreds; 
 
8  that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that 
showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, 
and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth unto me 
that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as 
at this day? 
 
9  Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants 
of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to 
Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
10  And he inquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and 
gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.  
11  ¶ Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of 
Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and 
 
they came all of them to the king. 
12  And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, 
Here I am, my lord.
