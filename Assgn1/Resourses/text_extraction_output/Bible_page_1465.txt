  1466    Ecclesiastes 3 
6  a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast 
 
away; 
 
7  a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time 
 
to speak; 
 
8  a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of 
 
peace. 
9  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth? 
 
10  ¶ I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men 
to be exercised in it. 
11  He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the 
 
world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God 
maketh from the beginning to the end. 
12  I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to 
do good in his life. 
13  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good 
of all his labor, it is the gift of God. 
14  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing 
 
can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that 
 
men should fear before him. 
15  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already 
 
been; and God requireth that which is past. 
 
The Injustice of Life 
16  ¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that 
wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity 
 
was there. 
17  I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: 
 
for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
18  I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that 
God might manifest them, and that they might see that they 
themselves are beasts. 
19  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one 
 
thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they
