  820    1 Kings 20 
17  And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of 
Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of 
 
Jehu shall Elisha slay. 
18  Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have 
not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. 
The Call of Elisha 
19  Â¶ So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who 
was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the 
twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. 
 
20  And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray 
thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. 
And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? 
   
21  And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew 
them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and 
gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went 
after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,

even the goodliest, are mine. 
4  And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, 
according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have. 
5  And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-
hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt 
deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
