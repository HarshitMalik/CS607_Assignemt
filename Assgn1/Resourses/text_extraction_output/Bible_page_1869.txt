The Book of Daniel 
[Daniel] 
1 
The Education of Daniel and His Friends 
1  In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.  
2  And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part 
of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of 
 
Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the 
 
treasure house of his god. 
3  And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that 
he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s 
seed, and of the princes; 
 
4  children in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in 
all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, 
and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and 
whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the 
Chaldeans.  
5  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, 
and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, 
 
that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
6  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, 
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
 
7  unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto 
 
Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; 
   
and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. 
 
8  ¶ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself 
with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he 
drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he 
 
might not defile himself. 
9  Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the 
prince of the eunuchs.
