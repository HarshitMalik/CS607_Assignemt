  2539    2 Timothy 2 
5  And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except 
he strive lawfully. 
6  The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits. 
7  Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all 
 
things. 
8  ¶ Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from 
the dead, according to my gospel: 
 
9  wherein I suffer trouble, as an evildoer, even unto bonds; but the 
 
word of God is not bound. 
10  Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they may also 
obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
11  It is a faithful saying: 
 
For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: 
 
12  if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: 
 
if we deny him, he also will deny us:  
 
13  if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: 
 
he cannot deny himself. 
An Approved Workman 
14  ¶ Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before 
the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the 
subverting of the hearers. 
15  Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth 
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
16  But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto 
 
more ungodliness. 
17  And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymeneus 
 
and Philetus; 
 
18  who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is 
past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
 
19  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, 
The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that 
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
