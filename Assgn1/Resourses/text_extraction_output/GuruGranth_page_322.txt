O Nanak, serve the Infinite Lord; grasp the hem of His robe, and He will save you.  || 
19 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Worldly affairs are unprofitable, if the One Lord does 
not come to mind. O Nanak, the bodies of those who forget their Master shall burst 
apart.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The ghost has been transformed into an angel by the 
Creator  Lord.  God  has  emancipated  all  the  Sikhs  and  resolved  their  affairs.  He  has 
seized the slanderers and thrown them to the ground, and declared them false in His 
Court.  Nanak‟s  God  is  glorious  and  great;  He  Himself  creates  and  adorns.    ||  2  ||   
PAUREE:  God is unlimited; He has no limit; He is the One who does everything. The 
Inaccessible and Unapproachable Lord and Master is the Support of His beings. Giving 
His Hand, He nurtures and cherishes; He is the Filler and Fulfiller. He Himself is Merciful 
and Forgiving. Chanting the True Name, one is saved. Whatever pleases You — that 
alone is good; slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  
One who belongs to God has no hunger. O Nanak, everyone who falls at his feet is 
saved.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  If the beggar begs for the Lord‟s Name every day, his 
Lord and Master will grant his request. O Nanak, the Transcendent Lord is the most 
generous host; He does not lack anything at all.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  To imbue the mind 
with the Lord of the Universe is the true food and dress. To embrace love for the Name 
of the Lord is to possess horses and elephants. To meditate on the Lord steadfastly is to 
rule over kingdoms of property and enjoy all sorts of pleasures. The minstrel begs at 
God‟s Door — he shall never leave that Door. Nanak has this yearning in his mind and 
body — he longs continually for God.  || 21 || 1 ||  SUDH KEECHAY  ||

GAUREE GWAARAYREE,  FOURTEEN CHAU-PADAS OF KABEER JEE:   
I was on fire, but now I have found the Water of the Lord‟s Name. This Water of the 
Lord‟s Name has cooled my burning body.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   To subdue their minds, 
some go off into the forests; but that Water is not found without the Lord God.  || 1 ||   
That fire has consumed angels and mortal beings, but the Water of the Lord‟s Name 
saves His humble servants from burning.  || 2 ||   In the terrifying world-ocean, there is 
an ocean of peace. I continue to drink it in, but this Water is never exhausted.  || 3 ||   
Says Kabeer, meditate and vibrate upon the Lord, like the sparrow-hawk remembering 
the  water.  The  Water  of  the  Lord‟s  Name  has  quenched  my  thirst.    ||  4  ||  1  ||   
GAUREE,  KABEER JEE:  O Lord, my thirst for the Water of Your Name will not go away. 
The fire of my thirst burns even more brightly in that Water.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You are 
the Ocean of Water, and I am just a fish in that Water. In that Water, I remain; without 
that Water, I would perish.  || 1 ||   You are the cage, and I am Your parrot. So what 
can the cat of death do to me?  || 2 ||   You are the tree, and I am the bird. I am so 
unfortunate — I cannot see the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan!  || 3 ||
