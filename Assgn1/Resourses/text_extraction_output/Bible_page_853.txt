  854    2 Kings 9 
2  and when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of 
Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up 
from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; 
 
3  then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith 
the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the 
door, and flee, and tarry not. 
4  ¶ So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to 
Ramoth-gilead. 
5  And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; 
 
and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, 
Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 
 
6  And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on 
 
his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I 
have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over 
Israel.  
7  And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may 
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all 
the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel. 
8  For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from 
 
Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and 
left in Israel: 
 
9  and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the 
son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: 
 
10  and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there 
shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled. 
11  ¶ Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said 
 
unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And 
   
he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. 
12  And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus 
 
spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee 
king over Israel. 
13  Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it 
under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, 
Jehu is king.
