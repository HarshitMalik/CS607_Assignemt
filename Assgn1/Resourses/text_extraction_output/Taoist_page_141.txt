When  energy  reaches  this  point,  it  is  like  a  flower  just
budding,  like  an  embryo  just  conceived.  True  energy
spontaneously  steams  and  circulates,  from  the  coccyx  up
through the spine into the head, down the nasal passages,
through the windpipe, to the heart, where it drops into the
central  elixir  field.  This  is  the  initial  movement  of  the
“waterwheel,” but only energy gets there—the spirit is not
yet complete, so it is not the true movement. Don’t bother
with it.
I just gaze steadily, very very subtly, watching over the
central chamber. Naturally there is endless living potential
there.  Practicing  this  for  a  month  or  two,  my  spirit
becomes  quieter  and  quieter.  When  you  are  quiet  for  a
long time, energy is increasingly produced. This is called
the  practice  of  spirit  producing  energy  and  energy
producing spirit.
A  hundred  or  more  days  of  this,  and  the  vital  spirit
grows  and  grows,  while  true  energy  gradually  becomes
full.  Warmth  appears  in  abundance,  and  there  is  good
circulation.  Water  and  fire  naturally  commingle,  and
heaven  and  earth  join.  The  spirit  is  fluid,  the  energy  is
expansive.  In  a  short  while  true  energy  unifies,  and  a
whirlwind  spontaneously  rises  up  into  the  hundred
channels. This is the true movement of the waterwheel.
During this interval, if a point of spiritual light is sensed
in  the  elixir  field,  this  is  the  “dark  pearl  at  the  bottom  of
the  water,”  the  “yellow  sprouts  inside  the  earth.”  At  that
time  one  yang  returns,  hazy  like  a  red  sun  when  it  first
