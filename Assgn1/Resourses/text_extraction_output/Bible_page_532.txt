  533    Joshua 17 
5  And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead 
and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 
 
6  because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his 
sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead. 
 
7  ¶ And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that 
lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand 
 
unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
8  Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the 
 
border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 
 
9  and the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the 
river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the 
   
coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the 
outgoings of it were at the sea: 
 
10  southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and 
the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, 
 
and in Issachar on the east. 
11  And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her 
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and 
her towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and her towns, and the 
inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of 
Megiddo and her towns, even three countries. 
12  Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of 
those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 
 
13  Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, 
that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive 
 
them out.  
14  ¶ And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast 
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a 
great people, forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto? 
 
15  And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee 
up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land 
of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow 
for thee. 
16  And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and 
 
all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots
