By thinking, He cannot be reduced to thought, even by thinking hundreds of thousands 
of times. By remaining silent, inner silence is not obtained, even by remaining lovingly 
absorbed deep within. The hunger of the hungry is not appeased, even by piling up 
loads of worldly goods. Hundreds of thousands of clever tricks, but not even one of 
them will go along with you in the end. So how can you become truthful? And how can 
the veil of illusion be torn away? O Nanak, it is written that you shall obey the Hukam of 
His Command, and walk in the Way of His Will.  || 1 ||   By His Command, bodies are 
created; His Command cannot be described. By His Command, souls come into being; 
by His Command, glory and greatness are obtained. By His Command, some are high 
and some are low; by His Written Command, pain and pleasure are obtained. Some, by 
His Command, are blessed and forgiven; others, by His Command, wander aimlessly 
forever.  Everyone  is  subject  to  His  Command;  no  one  is  beyond  His  Command.  O 
Nanak, one who understands His Command, does not speak in ego.  || 2 ||   Some sing 
of  His Power—who has that Power? Some  sing of His Gifts, and know His Sign and 
Insignia.  Some  sing  of  His  Glorious  Virtues,  Greatness  and  Beauty.  Some  sing  of 
knowledge obtained of Him, through difficult philosophical studies. Some sing that He 
fashions the body, and then again reduces it to dust. Some sing that He takes life away, 
and then again restores it.
