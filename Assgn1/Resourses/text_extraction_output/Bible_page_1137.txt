  1138    Job 6 
27  Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; 
 
hear it, and know thou it for thy good. 
6 
Job Reproaches His Friends 
1  But Job answered and said, 
2  Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, 
and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
 
3  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: 
 
therefore my words are swallowed up. 
4  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, 
the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: 
 
the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 
5  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? 
 
Or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
 
6  Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? 
 
Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 
 
7  The things that my soul refused to touch 
are as my sorrowful meat. 
8  Oh that I might have my request; 
 
and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 
 
9  Even that it would please God to destroy me; 
 
that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 
 
10  Then should I yet have comfort; 
 
yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: 
 
let him not spare; 
 
for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
11  What is my strength, that I should hope? 
 
And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
 
12  Is my strength the strength of stones? 
 
Or is my flesh of brass? 
 
13  Is not my help in me? 
 
And is wisdom driven quite from me?
