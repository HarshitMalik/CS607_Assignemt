  2627    Revelation 8 
Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the 
Lamb. 
11  And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the 
elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, 
and worshipped God, 
12  saying, 
Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and 
 
honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. 
Amen. 
13  Â¶ And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these 
which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 
   
14  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These 
are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their 
robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
15  Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and 
night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell 
 
among them. 
16  They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall 
 
the sun light on them, nor any heat.  
17  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, 
and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall 
 
wipe away all tears from their eyes.  
8 
The Seventh Seal 
1  And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in 
heaven about the space of half an hour. 
2  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them 
 
were given seven trumpets. 
3  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden 
censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should 
 
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which 
was before the throne.
