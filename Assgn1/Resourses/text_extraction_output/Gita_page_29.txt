THE YOGA OF THE DESPONDENCY OF ARJUNA
Dhrishtadyumno viraatashcha saatyakishchaaparaajitah.
17. The king of Kasi, an excellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty car-warrior, Dhristadyumna
and Virata and Satyaki, the unconquered,
Drupado draupadeyaashcha sarvashah prithiveepate;
Saubhadrashcha mahaabaahuh shankhaan dadhmuh prithak prithak.
18. Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the Earth, and the son of Subhadra, the
mighty-armed, all blew their respective conches!
Sa ghosho dhaartaraashtraanaam hridayaani vyadaarayat;
Nabhashcha prithiveem chaiva tumulo vyanunaadayan.
19. The tumultuous sound rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra’s party, making both heaven and
earth resound.
Atha vyavasthitaan drishtwaa dhaartaraashtraan kapidhwajah;
Pravritte shastrasampaate dhanurudyamya paandavah.
Hrisheekesham tadaa vaakyamidamaaha maheepate;
20. Then, seeing all the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing arrayed and the discharge
of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, whose ensign was that of a monkey, took up
his bow and said the following to Krishna, O Lord of the Earth!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Senayor ubhayormadhye ratham sthaapaya me’chyuta.
Yaavad etaan nireekshe’ham yoddhukaamaan avasthitaan;
Kair mayaa saha yoddhavyam asmin ranasamudyame.
Arjuna said:
21-22. In the middle of the two armies, place my chariot, O Krishna, so that I may behold
those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle begins.
Yotsyamaanaan avekshe’ham ya ete’tra samaagataah;
Dhaartaraashtrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyachikeershavah.
23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in battle
Duryodhana, the evil-minded.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Evamukto hrisheekesho gudaakeshena bhaarata;
Senayor ubhayormadhye sthaapayitwaa rathottamam.
