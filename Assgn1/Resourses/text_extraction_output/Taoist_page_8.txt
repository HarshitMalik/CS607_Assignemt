social philosophy and strategic thinking have also proved
to be of great interest to Western people in various walks
of  life.  These  are  among  the  dimensions  of  Taoism  that
have attracted the attention of professionals in many areas
â€”political  and  military;  agricultural,  industrial,  and

Meditation  is  one  element  of  Taoism  that  interests  a
broad  spectrum  of  people,  because  the  state  of  mind  is

in  both  classical  and  unitarian  phases,  is  currently
available  in  English  translation.  There  is  no  fixed  system
of  thought  or  practice  in  Taoism,  and  many  different
