  1166    Job 22 
15  Hast thou marked the old way 
which wicked men have trodden? 
 
16  which were cut down out of time, 
whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 
 
17  which said unto God, Depart from us: 
 
and what can the Almighty do for them? 
 
18  Yet he filled their houses with good things: 
 
but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
19  The righteous see it, and are glad: 
 
and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 
20  Whereas our substance is not cut down, 
but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 
21  Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: 
 
thereby good shall come unto thee. 
22  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, 
and lay up his words in thine heart. 
23  If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, 
thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
24  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, 
and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
25  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense, 
and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
26  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, 
and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 
27  Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, 
and thou shalt pay thy vows. 
28  Thou shalt also decree a thing, 
and it shall be established unto thee: 
 
and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
29  When men are cast down, 
then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; 
 
and he shall save the humble person. 
30  He shall deliver the island of the innocent: 
 
and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
