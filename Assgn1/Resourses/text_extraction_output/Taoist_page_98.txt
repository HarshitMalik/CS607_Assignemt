TREATISE ON SITTING FORGETTING
What  people  value  is  life;  what  life  values  is  the  Way.
When people have the Way, it is like fish having water. A
fish  in  a  dry  rut  will  still  seek  a  bucketful  of  water,  but
weak and dying worldlings do not even have the sense to
take to the Way.
How  contradictory  it  is  to  dislike  the  pains  of  life  and
death  yet  like  the  works  of  life  and  death,  and  to  respect
the names of the Way and virtue but disrespect the practice
of the Way and virtue!
When at an impasse, you think of getting through; when
lost,  you  think  of  getting  back.  Every  moment  of  time  is
precious  as  a  gem;  shame  and  awe  deepen  each  other.
Thus I have gratefully pursued the doctrines of the classics
and  have  outlined  seven  subjects  corresponding  to  the
teaching of mind, to serve as a pivotal aid to the process of
cultivating the Way.
