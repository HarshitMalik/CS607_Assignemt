  368    Numbers 23 
Balaam Blesses Israel 
41  ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and 
brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might 
see the utmost part of the people. 
23 
1  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and 
prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
2  And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam 
 
offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 
3  And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will 
go: peradventure the Lord will come to meet me; and whatsoever 
   
he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a high place. 
4  And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven 
 
altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. 
5  And the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return 
unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 
6  And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, 
he, and all the princes of Moab. 
7  And he took up his parable, and said, 
Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, 
out of the mountains of the east, saying, 
Come, curse me Jacob, 
and come, defy Israel. 
8  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? 
 
Or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied? 
 
9  For from the top of the rocks I see him, 
and from the hills I behold him: 
 
lo, the people shall dwell alone, 
and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
10  Who can count the dust of Jacob, 
and the number of the fourth part of Israel? 
 
Let me die the death of the righteous,
