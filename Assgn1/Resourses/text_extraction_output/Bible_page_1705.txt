  1706    Jeremiah 41 
Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in 
 
Mizpah. 
2  Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that 
were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of 
Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon 
had made governor over the land. 
3  Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with 
Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and 
the men of war.  
4  ¶ And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, 
and no man knew it, 
5  that there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from 
Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their 
clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense

meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he

Ahikam.

Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the 
midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. 
8  But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay 
us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, 
 
and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among 
their brethren. 
9  ¶ Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the 
men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the 
king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son 
 
of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. 
10  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that 
were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that 
remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard 
had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the
