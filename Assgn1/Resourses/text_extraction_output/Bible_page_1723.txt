  1724    Jeremiah 49 
21  The earth is moved at the noise of their fall; at the cry the noise 
 
thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
22  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings 
over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of 
 
Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 
The Prophecy concerning Damascus 
23  ¶ Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for 
 
they have heard evil tidings: they are faint-hearted; there is sorrow 
   
on the sea; it cannot be quiet. 
 
24  Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath 
seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in 
 
travail. 
25  How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 
 
26  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of 
war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord of hosts. 
27  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall 
consume the palaces of Ben-hadad. 
The Prophecy concerning Kedar and Hazor 
28  ¶ Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, 
which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the 
Lord; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. 
 
29  Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to 
 
themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; 
 
and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. 
30  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith 
the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel 
 
against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. 
31  Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without 
care, saith the Lord, which have neither gates nor bars, which 
dwell alone.
