  759    1 Kings 1 
10  but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and 
Solomon his brother, he called not. 
11  ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of 
Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of 
Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? 
 
12  Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that 
thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
13  Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not 
thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, 
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit 
upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 
   
14  Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come 
in after thee, and confirm thy words. 
15  ¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the 
 
king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto 
 
the king. 
16  And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the 
king said, What wouldest thou? 
 
17  And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God 
unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall 
reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
18  And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, 
 
thou knowest it not: 
 
19  and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and 
hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and 
Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not 
 
called. 
20  And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that 
thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the 
king after him. 
21  Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep 
with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted 
offenders. 
22  ¶ And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet 
also came in.
