  1443    Proverbs 23 
29  Seest thou a man diligent in his business? 
 
He shall stand before kings; 
 
he shall not stand before mean men. 
23 
1  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, 
consider diligently what is before thee: 
 
2  and put a knife to thy throat, 
if thou be a man given to appetite. 
3  Be not desirous of his dainties: 
 
for they are deceitful meat. 
4  Labor not to be rich; 
 
cease from thine own wisdom. 
5  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? 
 
For riches certainly make themselves wings; 
 
they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. 
6  Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, 
neither desire thou his dainty meats: 
 
7  for as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: 
 
Eat and drink, saith he to thee; 
 
but his heart is not with thee. 
8  The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, 
and lose thy sweet words. 
9  Speak not in the ears of a fool: 
 
for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 
10  Remove not the old landmark; 
 
and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 
 
11  for their Redeemer is mighty; 
 
he shall plead their cause with thee. 
12  Apply thine heart unto instruction, 
and thine ears to the words of knowledge. 
13  Withhold not correction from the child: 
 
for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. 
14  Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
