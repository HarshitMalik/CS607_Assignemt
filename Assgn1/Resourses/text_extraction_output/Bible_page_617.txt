  618    Ruth 4 
3  And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of 
the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother 
Elimelech’s: 
 
4  and I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the 
inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem 
it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may 
 
know: for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after 
   
thee. And he said, I will redeem it. 
5  Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of 
Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the 
dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 
6  And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar 
mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I 
   
cannot redeem it. 
7  ¶ Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning 
redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a 
 
man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a 
 
testimony in Israel. 
8  Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew 
off his shoe.  
9  And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are 
witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and 
all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi. 
10  Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I 
purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his 
inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among 
his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this 
 
day. 
11  And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are 
witnesses. The Lord make the woman that is come into thine 
house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of 
Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in 
 
Bethlehem:
