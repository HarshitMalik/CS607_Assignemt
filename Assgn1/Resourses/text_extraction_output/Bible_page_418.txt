  419    Deuteronomy 4 
32  ¶ For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, 
since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from 
the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any 
such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? 
 
33  Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of 
the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 
 
34  Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of 
another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by 
war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by 
great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you 
in Egypt before your eyes? 
 
35  Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the Lord 
he is God; there is none else beside him.  
 
36  Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might 
instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and 
   
thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 
37  And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed 
after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power 
out of Egypt; 
 
38  to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than 
thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, 
as it is this day. 
39  Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the 
Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there 
 
is none else. 
40  Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, 
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and 
with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days 
upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever. 
The Cities of Refuge East of the Jordan 
41  ¶ Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the 
sunrising;
