  138    Exodus 7 
3  And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my 
wonders in the land of Egypt.  
4  But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand 
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the 
children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
5  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch 
forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel 
from among them. 
6  And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did 
they. 
7  And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three 
years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
Aaron’s Rod 
8  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
9  When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for 
you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it 
 
before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. 
10  And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the 
Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before 
 
Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
11  Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the 
 
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their 
enchantments. 
12  For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: 
 
but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 
13  And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto 
them; as the Lord had said. 
 
The Plague of Blood 
14  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he 
refuseth to let the people go.
