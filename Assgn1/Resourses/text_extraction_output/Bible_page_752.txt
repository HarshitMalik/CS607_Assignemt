  753    2 Samuel 23 
12  But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew 
the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory. 
 
13  ¶ And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in 
the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the 
 
Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. 
14  And David was then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines 
was then in Bethlehem. 
15  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of 
the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! 
 
16  And the three mighty men brake through the host of the 
Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was 
by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he 
 
would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord. 
17  And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord, that I should do this: is not 
 
this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? 
 
therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three 
mighty men. 
18  ¶ And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief 
among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and 
slew them, and had the name among three. 
19  Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their 
 
captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three. 
 
20  ¶ And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of 
Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of 
Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in 
 
time of snow. 
21  And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a 
 
spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and 
 
plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his 
own spear. 
22  These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name 
among three mighty men. 
23  He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the 
first three. And David set him over his guard.
