  496    Joshua 2 
10  ¶ Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
11  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare 
you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to 
 
go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to 
possess it. 
12  ¶ And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of 
Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 
13  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord 
commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, 
and hath given you this land. 
14  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the 
land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass 
 
before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help 
them; 
 
15  until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, 
and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God 
giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, 
 
and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord’s servant gave you on this side 
Jordan toward the sunrising.  
16  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us 
we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. 
17  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we 
hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was 
 
with Moses. 
18  Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and 
will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, 
he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

The Spies Sent to Jericho 
1  And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy 
secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, 
and came into a harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
