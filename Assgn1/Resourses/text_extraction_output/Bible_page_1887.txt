  1888    Daniel 6 
19  ¶ Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste 
unto the den of lions. 
20  And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice 
unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, 
 
servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest 
continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? 
 
21  Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
22  My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that 
they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was 
 
found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
 
23  Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that 
they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up 
out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, 
because he believed in his God. 
24  And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had 
accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their 
children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, 
 
and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom 
of the den. 
25  ¶ Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, 
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
 
26  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men 
tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, 
 
and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be 
destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. 
27  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in 
heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of 
the lions. 
28  ¶ So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign 
of Cyrus the Persian.
