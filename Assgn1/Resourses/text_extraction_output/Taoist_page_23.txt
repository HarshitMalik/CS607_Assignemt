wood  energy  is  incomplete—the  hair  burns,  the  muscles
are debilitated; when the weakness spreads throughout the
five organs, one dies.
When  wandering  thoughts  sprout  and  stir,  this  is  when
sickness  originates.  People  today  do  not  notice  this;  they
invariably  wait  until  pain  affects  their  bodies  before  they
consider  themselves  sick,  not  knowing  it  was  not  an
overnight thing but developed gradually.
Outside  the  body  there  are  six  extremes—wind,  cold,
heat,  humidity,  dryness,  and  fire.  Inside  there  are  seven
feelings—joy,  anger,  sadness,  happiness,  worry,  fear,  and
surprise. Those who get sick because of the seven feelings
are  internally  impaired  and  develop  symptoms  of
deficiency. Those who get sick because of the six extremes
are externally destabilized and develop illnesses of excess.
Deficiency  calls  for  replenishment,  excess  should  be
drained off. Sickness resulting from injury to the temporal
physical  energy  can  be  cured  by  herbs,  minerals,
acupuncture,  and  moxabustion;  sickness  resulting  from
internal damage to the primal immaterial vitality and spirit
cannot be cured without inner gazing and quiet nurturing.
The ten great physicians cured people’s physical ills; the
sages  of  the  Three  Teachings  cured  people’s  mental  ills.
When friends are sick, everyone knows to look in on them;
but when people are sick themselves, they don’t know how
to look after themselves.
If  you  know  how  to  watch  yourself,  gazing  inwardly
you see no mind, gazing outwardly you see no body. Since
