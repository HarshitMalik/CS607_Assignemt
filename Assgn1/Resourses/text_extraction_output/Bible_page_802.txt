whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the 
priests of the high places. 
34  And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut 
it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

Ahijah’s Prophecy against Jeroboam 
1  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
2  And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise 
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get 
 
thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me 
 
that I should be king over this people. 
3  And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, 
and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. 
 
4  ¶ And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and 
came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes 
 
were set by reason of his age. 
5  And the Lord said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam 
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and 
   
thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, 
 
that she shall feign herself to be another woman. 
6  ¶ And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she 
came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; 
 
why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with 
 
heavy tidings. 
7  Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as 
I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over 
my people Israel, 
8  and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it 
thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my 
 
commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that 
only which was right in mine eyes;
