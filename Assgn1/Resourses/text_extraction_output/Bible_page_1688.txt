  1689    Jeremiah 34 
20  Thus saith the Lord; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and 
 
my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and 
night in their season; 
 
21  then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that 
he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the 
 
Levites the priests, my ministers. 
22  As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the 
sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and 
 
the Levites that minister unto me. 
23  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, 
24  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The 
two families which the Lord hath chosen, he hath even cast them 
off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no 
 
more a nation before them. 
25  Thus saith the Lord; If my covenant be not with day and night, 
 
and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
 
26  then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so 
that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, 
 
and have mercy on them.

Jeremiah’s Warning to Zedekiah 
1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the 
kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought 
against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah 
 
king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will 
 
give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall 
burn it with fire: 
 
3  and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, 
and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of
