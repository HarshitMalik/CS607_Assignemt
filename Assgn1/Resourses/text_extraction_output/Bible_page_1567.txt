  1568    Isaiah 43 
17  They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust 
in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. 
Israel’s Failure to Profit from Discipline 
18  ¶ Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. 
 
19  Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? 
   
who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant? 
 
20  Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but 
 
he heareth not. 
21  The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will 
 
magnify the law, and make it honorable. 
22  But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared 
 
in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and 
 
none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. 
 
23  Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for 
 
the time to come? 
 
24  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the 
 
Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk 
 
in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. 
25  Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the 
strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he 
 
knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. 
 
43 
The Lord the Only Redeemer 
1  But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he 
that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I 
 
have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. 
 
2  When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and 
 
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou 
 
walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall 
 
the flame kindle upon thee.
