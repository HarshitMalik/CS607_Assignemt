  2359    Acts 18 
12  ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made 
insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the 
judgment seat, 
13  saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the 
law. 
14  And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto 
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye 
Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
 
15  but if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye 
to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. 
 
16  And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
17  Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the 
synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared 
for none of those things. 
18  ¶ And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his 
leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him 
Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchreae: for he 
   
had a vow.  
19  And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself 
 
entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
20  When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he 
consented not; 
 
21  but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast 
that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God 
 
will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
Paul Returns to Antioch and Begins the Third Missionary Journey 
22  ¶ And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted 
the church, he went down to Antioch. 
23  And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over 
all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all 
the disciples.
