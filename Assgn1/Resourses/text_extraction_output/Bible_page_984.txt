  985    2 Chronicles 6 
thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray 
 
in this house; 
 
33  then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and 
do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all 
 
people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy 
people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is 
called by thy name. 
34  ¶ If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that 
thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city 
which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy 
name; 
 
35  then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their 
supplication, and maintain their cause. 
36  ¶ If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) 
and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their 
enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or 
near; 
 
37  yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried 
captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, 
saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt 
wickedly; 
 
38  if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in 
the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, 
and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, 
and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house 
which I have built for thy name: 
 
39  then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, 
their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and 
forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. 
40  Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine 
ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
41  Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou, and 
the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, be clothed 
 
with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
