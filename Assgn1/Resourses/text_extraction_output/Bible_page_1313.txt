  1314    Psalms 84 
11  Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb:  
 
yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:  
 
12  who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 
13  O my God, make them like a wheel; 
 
as the stubble before the wind. 
14  As the fire burneth a wood, 
and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 
 
15  so persecute them with thy tempest, 
and make them afraid with thy storm. 
16  Fill their faces with shame; 
 
that they may seek thy name, O Lord. 
17  Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; 
 
yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 
 
18  that men may know that thou, 
whose name alone is Jehovah, 
art the Most High over all the earth.

Longing for Godâ€™s House 
To the chief Musician upon Gittith,  
A Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
1  How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! 
 
2  My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: 
 
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
3  Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, 
and the swallow a nest for herself, 
where she may lay her young, 
even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, 
my King, and my God. 
4  Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: 
 
they will be still praising thee. 
Selah.
