  733    2 Samuel 17 
21  And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s 
concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel 
 
shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands 
 
of all that are with thee be strong. 
22  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and 
 
Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all 
Israel.  
23  And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, 
was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the 
 
counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

The Counsel of Ahithophel and Hushai 
1  Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out 
twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this 
night: 
 
2  and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and 
will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall 
 
flee; and I will smite the king only: 
   
3  and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou 
 
seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace. 
 
4  And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 
5  ¶ Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us 
hear likewise what he saith. 
6  And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, 
saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after 
 
his saying? if not, speak thou. 
 
7  And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath 
given is not good at this time. 
8  For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be 
mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of 
her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not 
 
lodge with the people.
