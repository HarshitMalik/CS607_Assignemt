  2050    Matthew 14 
The Feeding of the Five Thousand 
13  ¶ When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert 
place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed 
 
him on foot out of the cities. 
14  And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved 
with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. 
15  And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is 
a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, 
 
that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. 
16  But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to 
 
eat. 
17  And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two 
fishes. 
18  He said, Bring them hither to me. 
19  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and 
took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, 
he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the 
disciples to the multitude. 
20  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the 
 
fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
21  And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside 
women and children. 
Jesus Walks on the Sea 
22  ¶ And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, 
and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the 
multitudes away. 
23  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a 
mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was 
 
there alone. 
24  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for 
 
the wind was contrary.
