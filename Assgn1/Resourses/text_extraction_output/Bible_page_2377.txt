  2378    Acts 25 
2  Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against 
Paul, and besought him, 
3  and desired favor against him, that he would send for him to 
Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. 
4  But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that 
he himself would depart shortly thither. 
5  Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down 
with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. 
6  ¶ And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he 
went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the 
 
judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. 
7  And when he was come, the Jews which came down from 
Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous 
complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. 
8  While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, 
neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended 
any thing at all. 
9  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and 
said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these 
things before me? 
 
10  Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to 
be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well 
 
knowest. 
11  For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of 
death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things 
 
whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I 
appeal unto Caesar. 
12  Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, 
Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. 
 
Paul Brought before Agrippa and Bernice 
13  ¶ And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto 
Caesarea to salute Festus.
