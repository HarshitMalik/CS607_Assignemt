  863    2 Kings 12 
4  ¶ And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated 
things that is brought into the house of the Lord, even the money 
of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is 
set at, and all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring 
into the house of the Lord, 
5  let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and 
 
let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach 
shall be found. 
6  But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash 
the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 
7  Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other 
priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the 
house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, 
 
but deliver it for the breaches of the house. 
8  And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, 
neither to repair the breaches of the house. 
9  ¶ But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of 
it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into 
the house of the Lord: and the priests that kept the door put 
 
therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord. 
10  And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the 
chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they 
put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of 
the Lord. 
11  And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that 
did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the Lord: and 
 
they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon 
the house of the Lord, 
12  and to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed 
stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, and for all 
that was laid out for the house to repair it. 
13  Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of 
silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of 
silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord:
