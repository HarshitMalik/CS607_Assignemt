  391    Numbers 31 
31  And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded 
Moses. 
32  ¶ And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war 
had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and 
five thousand sheep, 
33  and threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 
34  and threescore and one thousand asses, 
35  and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not 
known man by lying with him. 
36  And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, 
was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty 
thousand and five hundred sheep: 
 
37  and the Lord’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore 
and fifteen. 
38  And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the Lord’s 
 
tribute was threescore and twelve. 
39  And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the 
 
Lord’s tribute was threescore and one. 
40  And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the Lord’s 
 
tribute was thirty and two persons. 
41  And Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord’s heave offering, 
unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
42  ¶ And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the 
men that warred, 
43  (now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three 
hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and 
five hundred sheep, 
44  and thirty and six thousand beeves, 
45  and thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 
46  and sixteen thousand persons,) 
47  even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, 
both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which 
kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses.
