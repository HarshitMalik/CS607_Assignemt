go  back  to  the  root  and  return  to  life,  the  ordinary  body
becomes the sacred embryo.
Since the world is only a construction of mind, why not
first  comprehend  mind?  Sense  data  enter  via
discriminating consciousness, so one must simply interrupt
discriminating  consciousness.  An  infant  has  no
discriminating  consciousness,  so  the  roiling  of  sense
objects  has  no  opening  to  enter.  In  realized  people  it  is
purely  knowledge;  the  realm  of  realities  is  thoroughly
clear, and all is the homeland of understanding subtleties.
MISTAKES
Deliberate  deviation  from  principle  is  called  evil.
Inadvertent deviation from principle is called a mistake.
A proverb says, “If people are not sages, how can they
make  no  mistakes?”  This  saying  can  be  used  to  forgive
other people, but it should not be used to excuse oneself.
When  he  was  fifty  years  old,  an  ancient  recognized
forty-nine  years  of  mistakes.  Now  that  I  am  eighty-five,
am I aware of eighty-four years of mistakes?
If  one  does  not  even  recognize  past  mistakes,  recent
mistakes are not easy to recognize.
Why?  When  you  are  deluded,  you  cling  to  wrong  as
right.
When  you  are  enlightened,  in  contrast,  you  see  even
right as if wrong.
