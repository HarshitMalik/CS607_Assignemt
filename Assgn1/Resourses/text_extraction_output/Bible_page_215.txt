The Furnishings of the Tabernacle 
1  And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half 
 
was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a 
cubit and a half the height of it: 
 
2  and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a 
crown of gold to it round about. 
3  And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of 
it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the 
 
other side of it. 
4  And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
5  And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear 
the ark. 
6  And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was 
 
the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 
7  And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece made 
he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 
 
8  one cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other 
end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on 
 
the two ends thereof. 
9  And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with 
their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; 
 
even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubim. 
10  Â¶ And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length 
 
thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the 
height thereof: 
 
11  and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of 
gold round about.
