22  But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews 
which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. 
Saul Escapes from the Jews 
23  ¶ And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to 
kill him: 
 
24  but their laying wait was known of Saul. And they watched the 
gates day and night to kill him. 
25  Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall 
in a basket.  
Saul at Jerusalem 
26  ¶ And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself 
to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not 
 
that he was a disciple. 
27  But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and 
declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that 
he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at 
Damascus in the name of Jesus. 
28  And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. 
29  And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed 
against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
 
30  Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to 
Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
31  ¶ Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and 
Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and 
 
in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. 
Aeneas Healed 
32  ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he 
came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
