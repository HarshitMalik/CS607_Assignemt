  1612    Jeremiah 2 
12  Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten 
 
my word to perform it. 
13  Â¶ And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, 
saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the 
   
face thereof is toward the north. 
14  Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break 
forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 
15  For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith 
the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his 
 
throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the 
walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. 
16  And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their 
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto 
other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. 
17  Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all 
that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I 
 
confound thee before them. 
18  For, behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron 
pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of 
Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and 
against the people of the land. 
19  And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against 
 
thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.

The Lord Pleads with Backsliding Israel 
1  Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
2  Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; I 
 
remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine 
espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land 
that was not sown.
