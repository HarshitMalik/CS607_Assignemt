  359    Numbers 20 
7  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
8  Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and 
Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; 
 
and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them 
water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their 
 
beasts drink. 
9  And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded 
him.

twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation 
 
drank, and their beasts also. 
12  And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed 
me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, 
therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I 
have given them. 
13  This is the water of Meribah [strife]; because the children of Israel 
 
strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.

a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 
   
16  and when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an 
angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are 
 
in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. 
17  Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass 
 
through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink 
of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s high way, we will
