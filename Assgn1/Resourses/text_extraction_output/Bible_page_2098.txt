  2099    Mark 1 
Jesus Departs on a Preaching Tour 
35  ¶ And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went 
out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
36  And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 
37  And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek 
for thee. 
38  And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may 
preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 
 
39  And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and 
cast out devils.  
Jesus Cleanses a Leper 
40  ¶ And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling 
down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make 
me clean. 
41  And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and 
touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. 
 
42  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed 
from him, and he was cleansed. 
43  And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
 
44  and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy 
 
way, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those 
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
45  But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad 
the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into 
the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him 
 
from every quarter.
