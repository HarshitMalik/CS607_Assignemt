  2284    John 13 
13  Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 
   
14  If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also 
 
ought to wash one another’s feet. 
15  For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done 
to you.  
16  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his 
lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
 
17  If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. 
18  I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the 
   
Scripture may be fulfilled, 
He that eateth bread with me 
hath lifted up his heel against me.  
19  Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may 
believe that I am he. 
20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send 
receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  
 
Jesus Foretells His Betrayal 
21  ¶ When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, 
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray 
me. 
22  Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he 
spake. 
23  Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom 
Jesus loved. 
24  Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it 
should be of whom he spake. 
25  He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
 
26  Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have 
dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas 
Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
27  And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto 
him, That thou doest, do quickly.
