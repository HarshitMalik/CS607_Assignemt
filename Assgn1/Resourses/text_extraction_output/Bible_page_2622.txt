  2623    Revelation 5 
5 
The Unopened Book and the Lamb 
1  And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book 
written within and on the back side, sealed with seven seals. 
2  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is 
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
 
3  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was 
able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 
4  And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and 
to read the book, neither to look thereon. 
5  And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of 
 
the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the 
book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 
6  Â¶ And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four 
beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been 
slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven 
Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 
7  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that 
sat upon the throne. 
8  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 
twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them 
harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.  
9  And they sung a new song, saying, 
Thou art worthy to take the book, 
and to open the seals thereof: 
 
for thou wast slain, 
and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood 
out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 
 
10  and hast made us unto our God kings and priests:  
 
and we shall reign on the earth. 
11  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the 
throne, and the beasts, and the elders: and the number of them was 
 
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
