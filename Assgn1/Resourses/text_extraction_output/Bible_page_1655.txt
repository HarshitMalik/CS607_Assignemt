  1656    Jeremiah 21 
16  And let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew, and 
repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the 
 
shouting at noontide; 
 
17  because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might 
 
have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me. 
18  Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, 
that my days should be consumed with shame? 
 
21 
The Destruction of Jerusalem Foretold 
1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when king 
Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and 
Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying, 
2  Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king 
 
of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the Lord will deal 
 
with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up 
from us. 
3  Â¶ Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 
 
4  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the 
 
weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against 
the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you 
without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this 
city. 
5  And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and 
with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
6  And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: 
 
they shall die of a great pestilence. 
7  And afterward, saith the Lord, I will deliver Zedekiah king of 
Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this 
city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into 
the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of 
their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and
