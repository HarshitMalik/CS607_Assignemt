  801    1 Kings 13 
9  for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Eat no 
bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou 
camest. 
10  So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came 
to Beth-el. 
11  ¶ Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came 
 
and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day 
in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them 
 
they told also to their father. 
12  And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons 
 
had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
13  And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him 
the ass: and he rode thereon, 
 
14  and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an 
oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest 
 
from Judah? And he said, I am. 
 
15  Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
16  And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: 
 
neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
 
17  for it was said to me by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eat no 
bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that 
thou camest. 
18  He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel 
 
spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back 
with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. 
But he lied unto him. 
19  So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and 
drank water. 
20  ¶ And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
 
21  and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, 
Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth 
of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the 
Lord thy God commanded thee,
