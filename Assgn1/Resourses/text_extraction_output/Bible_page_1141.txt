  1142    Job 8 
yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 
8  For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, 
and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
 
9  (for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, 
because our days upon earth are a shadow.) 
10  Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, 
and utter words out of their heart? 
 
11  Can the rush grow up without mire? 
 
Can the flag grow without water? 
 
12  Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, 
it withereth before any other herb. 
13  So are the paths of all that forget God; 
 
and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish: 
 
14  whose hope shall be cut off, 
and whose trust shall be a spider’s web. 
15  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: 
 
he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 
16  He is green before the sun, 
and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 
17  His roots are wrapped about the heap, 
and seeth the place of stones. 
18  If he destroy him from his place, 
then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 
19  Behold, this is the joy of his way, 
and out of the earth shall others grow. 
20  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, 
neither will he help the evildoers: 
 
21  till he fill thy mouth with laughing, 
and thy lips with rejoicing. 
22  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; 
 
and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
