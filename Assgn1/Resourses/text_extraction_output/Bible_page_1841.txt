  1842    Ezekiel 39 
39 
1  Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus 
saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief 
 
prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
 
2  and I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and 
will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee 
upon the mountains of Israel: 
 
3  and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine 
arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
4  Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy 
bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the 
 
ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field, to be 
devoured. 
5  Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the 
 
Lord God. 
6  And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell 
carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
 
7  ¶ So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people 
Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and 
   
the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in 
Israel. 
8  Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God; this is the 
 
day whereof I have spoken. 
9  ¶ And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall 
set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, 
the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and 
they shall burn them with fire seven years: 
 
10  so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down 
any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: 
   
and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that 
robbed them, saith the Lord God. 
11  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a 
place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the 
east of the sea; and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and
