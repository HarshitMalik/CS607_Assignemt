  1156    Job 17 
they have gathered themselves together against me. 
11  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, 
and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
12  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: 
 
he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, 
and set me up for his mark. 
13  His archers compass me round about, 
he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; 
 
he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
14  He breaketh me with breach upon breach; 
 
he runneth upon me like a giant. 
15  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, 
and defiled my horn in the dust. 
16  My face is foul with weeping, 
and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
 
17  not for any injustice in mine hands: 
 
also my prayer is pure. 
18  O earth, cover not thou my blood, 
and let my cry have no place. 
19  Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, 
and my record is on high. 
20  My friends scorn me: 
 
but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. 
21  Oh that one might plead for a man with God, 
as a man pleadeth for his neighbor! 
 
22  When a few years are come, 
then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. 
17 
1  My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, 
the graves are ready for me. 
2  Are there not mockers with me? 
 
And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 
 
3  Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;
