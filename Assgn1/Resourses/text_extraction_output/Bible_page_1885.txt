  1886    Daniel 6 
29  ¶ Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with 
scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a 
proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in 
the kingdom. 
30  ¶ In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. 
31  And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore 
and two years old. 
6 
Daniel in the Lions’ Den 
1  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty 
princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
 
2  and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the 
   
princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have 
no damage. 
3  Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, 
because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set 
 
him over the whole realm. 
4  Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against 
Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion 
 
nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error 
 
or fault found in him. 
5  Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this 
Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. 
6  ¶ Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, 
and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. 
7  All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, 
the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to 
establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever 
shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, 
O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
