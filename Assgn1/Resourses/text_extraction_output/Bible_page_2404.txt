  2405    Romans 8 
9  ¶ But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit 
of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, 
he is none of his. 
10  And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the 
 
Spirit is life because of righteousness. 
11  But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in 
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your 
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 
12  ¶ Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after 
the flesh. 
13  For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit 
 
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. 
14  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of 
God. 
15  For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye 
 
have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 
16  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the 
children of God: 
 
17  and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with 
 
Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also 
glorified together. 
18  ¶ For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not 
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 
19  For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the 
manifestation of the sons of God. 
20  For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by 
reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope; 
 
21  because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage 
of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 
22  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
pain together until now. 
23  And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of 
the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for 
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
