  656    1 Samuel 16 
11  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, 
 
There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the 
sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will 
 
not sit down till he come hither. 
12  And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of 
a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, 
Arise, anoint him: for this is he. 
 
13  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst 
of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from 
 
that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. 
David Plays the Harp for Saul 
14  ¶ But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit 
from the Lord troubled him. 
15  And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from 
God troubleth thee. 
16  Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to 
seek out a man, who is a cunning player on a harp: and it shall come 
 
to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall 
play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. 
17  And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can 
play well, and bring him to me. 
18  Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a 
son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a 
mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and 
a comely person, and the Lord is with him. 
19  Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me 
David thy son, which is with the sheep. 
20  And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a 
kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. 
21  And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him 
 
greatly; and he became his armor-bearer. 
 
22  And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before 
me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
