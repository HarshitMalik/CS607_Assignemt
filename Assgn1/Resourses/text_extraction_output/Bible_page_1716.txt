  1717    Jeremiah 47 
22  The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with 
 
an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 
23  They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be 
searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are 
 
innumerable. 
24  The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered 
 
into the hand of the people of the north. 
25  ¶ The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish 
 
the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and 
their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him: 
   
26  and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, 
and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the 
hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the 
 
days of old, saith the Lord. 
27  ¶ But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O 
Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from 
 
the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and 
 
at ease, and none shall make him afraid. 
28  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord: for I am with 
 
thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have 
 
driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee 
 
in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.

The Prophecy concerning the Philistines 
1  The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against 
the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 
2  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and 
 
shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all 
that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men 
   
shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
