thereon. 
19  And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of 
Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the 
Lord God, a young bullock for a sin offering. 
20  And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four 
horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the 
border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. 
 
21  Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall 
burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
22  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without 
blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they 
 
did cleanse it with the bullock. 
23  When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a 
young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without 
blemish. 
24  And thou shalt offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall 
cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt 
offering unto the Lord. 
25  Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: 
 
they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, 
without blemish. 
26  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall 
 
consecrate themselves. 
27  And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth 
day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings 
upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith 
 
the Lord God.

sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
