  704    2 Samuel 5 
10  when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have 
brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, 
who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:  
 
11  how much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person 
in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require 
 
his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
 
12  And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and 
cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool 
in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in 
the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

David Made King over Israel 
1  Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, 
saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
2  Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that 
leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, 
 
Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over 
Israel. 
3  So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king 
 
David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and 
 
they anointed David king over Israel. 
4  David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 
forty years. 
5  In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and 
 
in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and 
Judah.  
David Captures Zion 
6  Â¶ And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, 
the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
