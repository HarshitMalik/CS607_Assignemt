death.
While  people  are  in  the  world,  events  go  on
continuously,  and  they  eventually  die;  on  the  brink  of
death, what means can be used to avoid it? It is better to
change your attitude as soon as possible, letting go of all
sorts of entanglements in sense objects, to become a long-
lived person beyond the world. Wouldn’t that be good?
Some may ask, we have been wrapped up in the objects
of the senses for a long, long time; won’t it be hard to let
go of them all at once, even if we want to? The answer to
this  is  that  you  are  unwilling  to  let  go—that  is  why  you
say  it’s  hard.  Suppose  you  die—is  there  anything  you
don’t let go of? Even though you’re not dead now, suppose
yourself  to  be  already  dead—when  you  let  go  of
everything, what is not wondrous?
It is also asked what we let go of. The answer is that we
let go of the four gross elements, the five clusters, seeds of
emotionalized  consciousness.  Real  practitioners  of  the
Way should be as if totally dead once, and then return to
life.  For  people  who  are  totally  dead,  there  is  no  world
wrapping  them  up,  and  no  mystic  principle.  When  you
reach total cessation like this, only then is it settled.
Confucius  said,  “If  you  hear  the  Way  in  the  morning,
you can die content that night.” This saying teaches people
the  critical  point.  It  seems  to  mean  that  when  superior
people  have  heard  the  Way,  they  comprehend  life  and
death in an instant.
