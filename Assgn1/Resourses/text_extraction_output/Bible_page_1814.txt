  1815    Ezekiel 28 
33  When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many 
people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude 
 
of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 
34  In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of 
the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of 
thee shall fall. 
35  All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their 
kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their 
countenance. 
36  The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a 
 
terror, and never shalt be any more.  
28 
1  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God; 
 
Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit 
in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and 
 
not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 
 
3  behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can 
 
hide from thee: 
 
4  with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten 
thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
 
5  by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy 
riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: 
 
6  therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast set thine 
 
heart as the heart of God; 
 
7  behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of 
the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of 
 
thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 
8  They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths 
of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. 
9  Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou 
 
shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
