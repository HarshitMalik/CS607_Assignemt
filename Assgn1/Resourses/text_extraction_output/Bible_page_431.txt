  432    Deuteronomy 9 
19  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the 
Lord was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord 
hearkened unto me at that time also. 
20  And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: 
 
and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
21  And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with 
fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as 
small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that 
 
descended out of the mount. 
22  ¶ And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye 
provoked the Lord to wrath. 
23  Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go 
up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled 
 
against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed 
him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 
24  Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew 
you. 
25  ¶ Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I 
fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy 
 
you. 
26  I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy 
not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed 
through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt 
with a mighty hand. 
27  Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto 
 
the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to 
their sin: 
 
28  lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord 
was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, 
and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them 
in the wilderness. 
29  Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou 
broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
