  2472    2 Corinthians 11 
9  And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to 
no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came 
 
from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from 
 
being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. 
10  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this 
boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
11  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
   
12  ¶ But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from 
them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be 
 
found even as we. 
13  For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming 
themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of 
 
light. 
15  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as 
the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to 
 
their works. 
Paul’s Sufferings as an Apostle 
16  ¶ I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool 
 
receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
17  That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were 
foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
18  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
19  For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. 
20  For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, 
if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on 
the face. 
21  I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. 
¶ Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am 
bold also. 
22  Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they 
   
the seed of Abraham? so am I.
