  695    2 Samuel 1 
was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have 
brought them hither unto my lord.  
11  ¶ Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise 
 
all the men that were with him: 
 
12  and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and 
for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the 
house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. 
 
13  And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art 
thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 
 
14  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch 
forth thine hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed? 
 
15  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall 
upon him. And he smote him that he died. 
16  And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy 
 
mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord’s 
anointed.

how are the mighty fallen!

lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, 
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 
21  Ye mountains of Gilboa, 
let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, 
nor fields of offerings: 
 
for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, 
the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. 
22  From the blood of the slain,
