true body.” The Scripture on the Western Ascent says, “It
is possible to live long by virtue of unification of body and
spirit.”
However, there are differences in depth of the power of
the Way of absolute nonresistance. When it is deep, it also
affects the body; when it is shallow, it only influences the
mind.  Those  whose  bodies  are  affected  are  the  spiritual
people;  those  whose  minds  are  influenced  only  gain
insightful  awareness,  while  their  bodies  cannot  escape
passing away.
Why  is  that?  Insight  is  a  function  of  mind;  when  it  is
worked  too  much,  the  mind  is  fatigued.  When  you  first
attain  a  little  insight,  if  you  are  delighted  and  talk  too
much,  your  spiritual  energy  leaks  out,  and  there  is  no
spiritual  refreshment  of  the  light  of  the  body.  This
ultimately causes an early end, so the Way can hardly be
completed.  This  is  what  scriptures  call  dissolution  of  the
corpse.
For this reason, great people conceal their light and hide
their  brilliance  in  hopes  of  attaining  completeness.
Stabilizing  their  spirit,  treasuring  their  energy,  they  study
the  Way  and  extinguish  their  minds.  When  spirit  unites
with  the  Way,  this  is  called  attaining  the  Way.  Scripture
says,  “Those  who  assimilate  to  the  Way  also  attain  the
Way.” It also says, “Why did the ancients value this Way?
By it one can attain without long seeking and escape from
the faults one has.”
