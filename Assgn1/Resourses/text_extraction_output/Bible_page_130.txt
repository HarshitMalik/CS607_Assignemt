  131    Exodus 4 
4 
1  And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe 
me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath 
 
not appeared unto thee. 
2  And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he 
 
said, A rod. 
3  And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, 
and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
 
4  And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it 
by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became 
a rod in his hand: 
 
5  that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God 
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared 
unto thee. 
6  And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand 
into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he 
 
took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. 
7  And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his 
hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, 
 
behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. 
8  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither 
hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice 
of the latter sign. 
9  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two 
signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the 
water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water 
 
which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry 
land. 
10  ¶ And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, 
neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; 
 
but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 
11  And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or 
 
who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have 
 
not I the Lord?
