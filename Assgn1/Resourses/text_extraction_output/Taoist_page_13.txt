letting  them  go  and  come  without  being  moved  by  them
while in their very midst.
If superior people only study the Way, is it because they
gain some benefit? Yes, it is. What is that benefit? Those
who study the Way study what is in the self. The mind can
be broadened, the body can be benefited; sickness can be
cured, death can be avoided. No benefits are greater than
these.
Do  people  who  study  the  Way  actually  gain  these
benefits and pleasures? If they do, then why do people of
the world all get irritated when they see people who study
the Way, considering them eccentrics or phonies? The Tao
Te  Ching  says,  “When  superior  people  hear  of  the  Way,
they travel it diligently. When mediocre people hear of the
way, they seem aware, yet are as if oblivious. When lesser
people  hear  of  the  Way,  they  laugh  at  it  out  loud.  What
they don’t laugh at couldn’t be the Way.”
PRINCIPLE
The  Way  is  one  and  only  one.  On  the  celestial  level  it  is
called  destiny;  on  the  human  level  it  is  called  essential
nature. On the phenomenal level it is called principle.
This  principle  circulates  throughout  the  world,
appearing in daily activities. Every event and every thing
has  a  natural  principle,  which  cannot  be  dispensed  with.
Thus there is a principle whereby things are as they are; it
cannot be altered, only followed.
