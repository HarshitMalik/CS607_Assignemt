  2636    Revelation 14 
10  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth 
 
with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience 
and the faith of the saints. 
11  ¶ And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he 
 
had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
12  And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and 
causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first 
beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
13  And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down 
from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 
14  and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those 
miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying 
 
to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to 
the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 
15  And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the 
image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as 
would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 
16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
 
17  and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or 
the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
18  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the 
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
   
is Six hundred threescore and six.

The Song of the 144,000 
1  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with 
him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name 
written in their foreheads.  
2  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and 
as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers 
 
harping with their harps:
