  2329    Acts 8 
Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch 
26  Â¶ And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go 
toward the south, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem 
unto Gaza, which is desert. 
27  And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch 
 
of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had 
the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to 
worship, 
28  was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet. 
29  Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this 
chariot. 
30  And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet 
Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
 
31  And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And 
 
he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
32  The place of the Scripture which he read was this, 
He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; 
 
and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, 
so opened he not his mouth: 
 
33  in his humiliation his judgment was taken away: 
 
and who shall declare his generation? 
 
for his life is taken from the earth.  
34  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom 
speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
   
35  Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, 
and preached unto him Jesus. 
36  And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and 
 
the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be 
 
baptized? 
 
37  And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. 
And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of 
God.
