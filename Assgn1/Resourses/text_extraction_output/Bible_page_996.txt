  997    2 Chronicles 13 
8  Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my 
 
service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 
9  ¶ So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took 
away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of 
the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of 
   
gold which Solomon had made.  
10  Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and 
committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the 
entrance of the king’s house. 
11  And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the guard 
came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard 
chamber. 
12  And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned 
from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in 
 
Judah things went well. 
13  ¶ So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and 
reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began 
 
to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city 
which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his 
name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. 
14  And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the 
Lord. 
15  ¶ Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in 
the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning 
genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam 
 
continually. 
16  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of 
David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

The Reign of Abijah 
1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign 
over Judah.
