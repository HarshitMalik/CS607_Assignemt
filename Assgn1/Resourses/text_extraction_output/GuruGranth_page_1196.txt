Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
I am the hand-maiden of my Lord and Master. I have grasped the Feet of God, the Life 
of the world. He has killed and eradicated my egotism.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the 
Perfect, Supreme Light, the Supreme Lord God, my Beloved, my Breath of Life. The 
Fascinating  Lord  has  fascinated  my  mind;  contemplating  the  Word  of  the  Shabad,  I 
have come to understand.  || 1 ||   The worthless self-willed manmukh, with false and 
shallow understanding — his mind and body are held in pain‟s grip. Since I came to be 
imbued with the Love of my Beautiful Lord, I meditate on the Lord, and my mind is 
encouraged.  || 2 ||   Abandoning egotism, I have become detached. And now, I absorb 
true  intuitive  understanding.  The  mind  is  pleased  and  appeased  by  the  Pure, 
Immaculate Lord; the opinions of other people are irrelevant.  || 3 ||   There is no other 
like You, in the past or in the future, O my Beloved, my Breath of Life, my Support. The 
soul-bride is imbued with the Name of the Lord; O Nanak, the Lord is her Husband.  || 
4 || 1 ||   SAARANG,  FIRST MEHL:  How can I survive without the Lord? I am suffering 
in pain. My tongue does not taste — all is bland without the Lord‟s sublime essence. 
Without God, I suffer and die.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   As long as I do not attain the Blessed 
Vision of my Beloved, I remain hungry and thirsty. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of 
His Darshan, my mind is pleased and appeased. The lotus blossoms forth in the water.  
|| 1 ||   The low-hanging clouds crack with thunder and burst. The cuckoos and the 
peacocks are filled with passion, along with the birds in the trees, the bulls and the 
snakes. The soul-bride is happy when her Husband Lord returns home.  || 2 ||   She is 
filthy and ugly, unfeminine and ill-mannered — she has no intuitive understanding of 
her Husband Lord. She is not satisfied by the sublime essence of her Lord‟s Love; she is 
evil-minded, immersed in her pain.  || 3 ||   The soul-bride does not come and go in 
reincarnation or suffer in pain; her body is not touched by the pain of disease. O Nanak, 
she is intuitively embellished by God; seeing God, her mind is encouraged.  || 4 || 2 ||   
SAARANG,  FIRST MEHL:  My Beloved Lord God is not far away. My mind is pleased and 
appeased by the Word of the True Guru‟s Teachings.
