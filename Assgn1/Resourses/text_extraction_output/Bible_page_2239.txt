  2240    Luke 24 
29  But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward 
 
evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with 
them. 
30  And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and 
blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 
31  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished 
 
out of their sight. 
32  And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, 
while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the 
Scriptures?

found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
34  saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
35  And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was 
known of them in breaking of bread.

see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 
 
40  And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his 
feet. 
41  And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said 
unto them, Have ye here any meat? 
 
42  And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb. 
43  And he took it, and did eat before them. 
44  ¶ And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto 
you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
