  1490    Song of Solomon 8 
8  I said, I will go up to the palm tree, 
I will take hold of the boughs thereof: 
 
now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, 
and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
 
9  and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, 
that goeth down sweetly, 
causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. 
10  I am my beloved’s, 
and his desire is toward me. 
11  Come, my beloved, 
let us go forth into the field; 
 
let us lodge in the villages. 
12  Let us get up early to the vineyards; 
 
let us see if the vine flourish, 
whether the tender grape appear, 
and the pomegranates bud forth: 
 
there will I give thee my loves. 
13  The mandrakes give a smell, 
and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, 
which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. 
8 
1  O that thou wert as my brother, 
that sucked the breasts of my mother! 
 
When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; 
 
yea, I should not be despised. 
2  I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, 
who would instruct me: 
 
I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine 
of the juice of my pomegranate. 
3  His left hand should be under my head, 
and his right hand should embrace me. 
4  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, 
that ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
