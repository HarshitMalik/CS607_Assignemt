  449    Deuteronomy 17 
The Administration of Justice 
18  ¶ Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which 
the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they 
 
shall judge the people with just judgment. 
19  Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, 
 
neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and 
 
pervert the words of the righteous.  
20  That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest 
live, and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 
21  ¶ Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar 
of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee. 
22  Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the Lord thy God 
 
hateth. 
17 
1  Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock, or 
sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evil-favoredness: for that is an 
 
abomination unto the Lord thy God. 
2  ¶ If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought 
wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God, in transgressing his 
covenant, 
3  and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either 
the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not 
commanded; 
 
4  and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired 
diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such 
abomination is wrought in Israel: 
 
5  then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have 
committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that 
woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.
