  633    1 Samuel 7 
7 
1  And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the 
Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and 
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord.  
2  And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the 
time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel 
   
lamented after the Lord. 
Samuel Judges Israel 
3  ¶ And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do 
return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the 
strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your 
hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only: and he will deliver you 
 
out of the hand of the Philistines. 
4  Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and 
served the Lord only. 
5  ¶ And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for 
you unto the Lord. 
6  And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured 
it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We 
have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of 
Israel in Mizpeh. 
7  And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were 
gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up 
against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were 
afraid of the Philistines. 
8  And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the 
Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the 
Philistines. 
9  And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering 
wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel; 
   
and the Lord heard him.
