  1718    Jeremiah 48 
3  At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the 
rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the 
fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands; 
 
4  because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut 
off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the 
 
Lord will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of 
Caphtor. 
5  Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant 
 
of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 
   
6  O thou sword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? 
 
put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. 
7  How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against 
Ashkelon, and against the seashore? there hath he appointed it.

The Prophecy concerning Moab 
1  Against Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe 
 
unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: 
     
Misgab is confounded and dismayed. 
2  There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have 
 
devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a 
 
nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall 
 
pursue thee. 
3  A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great 
destruction. 
4  Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. 
 
5  For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in 
 
the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of 
destruction. 
6  Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. 
7  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, 
thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity 
 
with his priests and his princes together.
