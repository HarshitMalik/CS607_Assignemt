  327    Numbers 8 
The Cleansing of the Levites 
5  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
6  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse 
them. 
7  And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water 
 
of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let 
them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. 
8  Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even 
fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou 
take for a sin offering. 
9  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the 
congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the 
 
children of Israel together. 
10  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord: and the children 
 
of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: 
 
11  and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of 
the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the 
Lord. 
12  And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the 
bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the 
 
other for a burnt offering, unto the Lord, to make an atonement 
for the Levites. 
13  And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, 
and offer them for an offering unto the Lord. 
14  ¶ Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of 
Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 
 
15  And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the 
tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and 
 
offer them for an offering. 
16  For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of 
Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the 
 
firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
