  2546    Titus 3 
8  sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the 
 
contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
9  Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please 
them well in all things; not answering again; 
   
10  not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn 
 
the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 
11  ¶ For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all 
men, 
12  teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should 
live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
 
13  looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the 
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
 
14  who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, 
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
15  ¶ These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let 
no man despise thee.

magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
2  to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all 
meekness unto all men.

deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and 
envy, hateful, and hating one another. 
4  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward 
man appeared, 
5  not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according 
to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and 
renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
 
6  which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
