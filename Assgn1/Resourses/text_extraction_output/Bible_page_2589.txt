  2590    1 Peter 4 
21  The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us, (not 
the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good 
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 
 
22  who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels 
 
and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

Good Stewards of God’s Grace 
1  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm 
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered 
 
in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
 
2  that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the 
lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
3  For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will 
of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of 
wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 
 
4  wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same 
excess of riot, speaking evil of you: 
 
5  who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and 
the dead. 
6  For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are 
dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but 
live according to God in the spirit. 
7  ¶ But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and 
 
watch unto prayer. 
8  And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for 
 
charity shall cover the multitude of sins.  
9  Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
10  As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one 
to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 
11  If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man 
 
minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in
