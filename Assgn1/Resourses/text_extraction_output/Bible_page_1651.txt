  1652    Jeremiah 19 
17  I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will 
 
show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. 
The People’s Plots and Jeremiah’s Prayer 
18  ¶ Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; 
 
for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the 
wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him 
with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.

21  Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out

let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. 
22  Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop 
suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid 
 
snares for my feet. 
23  Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: 
 
forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, 
but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the 
 
time of thine anger.

1  Thus saith the Lord, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and take 
of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; 
 
2  and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the 
entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell 
thee:
