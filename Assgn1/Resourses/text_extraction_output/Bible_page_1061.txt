  1062    Ezra 4 
13  Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the 
walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, 
and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. 
14  Now because we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it 
was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we 
sent and certified the king; 
 
15  that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: 
 
so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this 
city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and 
that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for 
 
which cause was this city destroyed. 
16  We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls 
thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side 
the river. 
17  ¶ Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to 
Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell 
in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a 
time. 
18  The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 
19  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that 
this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that 
rebellion and sedition have been made therein. 
20  There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have 
ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and 
 
custom, was paid unto them. 
21  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that 
this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given 
from me. 
22  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow 
 
to the hurt of the kings? 
 
23  ¶ Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before 
Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went 
up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by 
force and power.
