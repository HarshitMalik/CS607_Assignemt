  2473    2 Corinthians 12 
23  Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am more; in 
   
labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more 
frequent, in deaths oft. 
24  Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.  
25  Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered 
shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
 
26  in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in 
perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in 
the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils 
among false brethren; 
 
27  in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and 
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
28  Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me 
daily, the care of all the churches. 
29  Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 
   
30  ¶ If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern 
mine infirmities. 
31  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for 
evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
32  In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of 
the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
 
33  and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and 
escaped his hands.

Paul’s Thorn in the Flesh 
1  It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions 
and revelations of the Lord. 
2  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the 
body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God 
   
knoweth;) such a one caught up to the third heaven. 
 
3  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I 
cannot tell: God knoweth;)
