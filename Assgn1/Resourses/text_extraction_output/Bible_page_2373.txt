  2374    Acts 23 
14  And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have 
bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until 
we have slain Paul. 
15  Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that 
he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though ye would 
inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever 
 
he come near, are ready to kill him. 
16  ¶ And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went 
and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
17  Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring 
this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing

18  So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul 
the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young 
man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. 
19  Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him

20  And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest 
bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would 
inquire somewhat of him more perfectly. 
21  But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of 
 
them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an 
oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: 
 
and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. 
22  So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged 
him, See thou tell no man that thou hast showed these things to me. 
Paul Sent to Felix the Governor 
23  ¶ And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two 
hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and 
ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; 
 
24  and provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him 
safe unto Felix the governor. 
25  And he wrote a letter after this manner:
