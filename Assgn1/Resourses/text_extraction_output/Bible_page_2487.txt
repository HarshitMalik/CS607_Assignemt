1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,

Lord Jesus Christ. 
Spiritual Blessings in Christ 
3  ¶ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath 
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 
 
4  according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the 
world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in 
love: 
 
5  having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus 
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
6  to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us 
accepted in the beloved: 
 
7  in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of 
sins, according to the riches of his grace; 
 
8  wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 
 
9  having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to 
his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 
 
10  that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather 
together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and 
which are on earth; even in him.
