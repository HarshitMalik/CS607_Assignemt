  1337    Psalms 103 
yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; 
 
as a vesture shalt thou change them, 
and they shall be changed: 
 
27  but thou art the same, 
and thy years shall have no end.  
28  The children of thy servants shall continue, 
and their seed shall be established before thee.

Praise for the Lord’s Benefits 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Bless the Lord, O my soul: 
 
and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
2  Bless the Lord, O my soul, 
and forget not all his benefits: 
 
3  who forgiveth all thine iniquities; 
 
who healeth all thy diseases; 
 
4  who redeemeth thy life from destruction; 
 
who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; 
 
5  who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; 
 
so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 
6  The Lord executeth righteousness 
and judgment for all that are oppressed. 
7  He made known his ways unto Moses, 
his acts unto the children of Israel. 
8  The Lord is merciful and gracious,  
slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 
9  He will not always chide: 
 
neither will he keep his anger for ever. 
10  He hath not dealt with us after our sins; 
 
nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
11  For as the heaven is high above the earth,
