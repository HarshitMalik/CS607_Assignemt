  931    1 Chronicles 11 
Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord 
concerning Israel. 
11  And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; 
 
Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his 
 
spear against three hundred slain by him at one time. 
12  ¶ And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was 
one of the three mighties. 
13  He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were 
gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of 
barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
 
14  And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, 
and slew the Philistines; and the Lord saved them by a great 
 
deliverance. 
15  ¶ Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, 
into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped 
 
in the valley of Rephaim. 
16  And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was 
then at Bethlehem. 
17  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of 
the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate! 
 
18  And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew 
water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took 
it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but 
 
poured it out to the Lord, 
19  and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I 
 
drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? 
 
for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it: therefore he 
 
would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. 
20  ¶ And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for 
 
lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a 
name among the three. 
21  Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their 
 
captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.
