  392    Numbers 32 
48  Â¶ And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the 
captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto 
Moses: 
 
49  and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the 
men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one 
man of us. 
50  We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what every 
man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, 
earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the 
Lord. 
51  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all 
wrought jewels. 
52  And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord, of 
the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was 
sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 
53  (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 
54  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of 
thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of 
the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before 
the Lord.

Reuben, Gad, and Half of Manasseh Settle East of the Jordan 
1  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very 
great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and 
 
the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle; 
 
2  the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake 
unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the 
congregation, saying, 
3  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and 
Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
4  even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of 
Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
