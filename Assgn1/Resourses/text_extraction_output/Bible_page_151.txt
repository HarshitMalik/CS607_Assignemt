  152    Exodus 12 
24  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy 
sons for ever. 
25  And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the 
Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall 
keep this service. 
26  And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, 
What mean ye by this service? 
 
27  That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s passover, who 
passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he 
smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people 
bowed the head and worshipped. 
28  ¶ And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had 
commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
The Death of the Firstborn 
29  ¶ And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the 
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that 
sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the 
dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
 
30  And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all 
the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a 
   
house where there was not one dead. 
31  And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and 
get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of 
Israel; and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said. 
 
32  Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; 
 
and bless me also. 
33  ¶ And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might 
send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead 
 
men. 
34  And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their 
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their 
shoulders.
