  755    2 Samuel 24 
4  Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and 
against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the 
host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people 
of Israel. 
5  And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right 
side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward 
Jazer: 
 
6  then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and 
 
they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon, 
7  and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the 
Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of 
 
Judah, even to Beer-sheba. 
8  So when they had gone through all the land, they came to 
Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
9  And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the 
king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men 
 
that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred 
 
thousand men. 
10  ¶ And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the 
people. And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in 
that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the 
 
iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
 
11  For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord 
came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
12  Go and say unto David, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three 
things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. 
 
13  So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall 
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee 
 
three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that 
 
there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see 
 
what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 
14  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into 
 
the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall 
   
into the hand of man.
