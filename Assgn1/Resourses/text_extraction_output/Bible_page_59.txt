  60    Genesis 26 
16  And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much 
 
mightier than we. 
17  ¶ And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of 
Gerar, and dwelt there. 
18  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in 
the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped 
 
them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after 
 
the names by which his father had called them. 
19  And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of 
springing water. 
20  And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, 
The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek 
 
[contention]; because they strove with him. 
 
21  And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he 
 
called the name of it Sitnah [hatred]. 
22  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for 
 
that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth [room]; 
   
and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we 
shall be fruitful in the land. 
23  ¶ And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 
24  And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am 
the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and 
 
will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s 
sake. 
25  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the 
Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged 
 
a well. 
26  ¶ Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of 
his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
27  And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate 
me, and have sent me away from you? 
 
28  And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and 
 
we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and 
thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
