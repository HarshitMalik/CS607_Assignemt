  1207    Psalms 7 
I water my couch with my tears. 
7  Mine eye is consumed because of grief; 
 
it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 
8  Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;  
 
for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
9  The Lord hath heard my supplication; 
 
the Lord will receive my prayer. 
10  Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: 
 
let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

A Prayer for Vindication 
Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord,  
concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. 
1  O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: 
 
save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 
 
2  lest he tear my soul like a lion, 
rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
3  O Lord my God, if I have done this; 
 
if there be iniquity in my hands; 
 
4  if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; 
 
(yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy;) 
 
5  let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; 
 
yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, 
and lay mine honor in the dust. 
Selah. 
6  Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, 
lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: 
 
and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. 
7  So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: 
 
for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
8  The Lord shall judge the people:
