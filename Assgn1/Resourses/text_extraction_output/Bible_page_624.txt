  625    1 Samuel 3 
29  Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I 
have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above 
 
me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of 
Israel my people? 
 
30  Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy 
house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: 
 
but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me 
 
I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 
31  Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of 
thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine 
house. 
32  And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth 
which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in 
 
thine house for ever. 
33  And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, 
shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the 
 
increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. 
34  And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two 
sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of 
 
them. 
35  And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to 
that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a 
 
sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 
 
36  And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house 
shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of 
bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ 
offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

The Lord Calls Samuel 
1  And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And 
the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open 
 
vision.
