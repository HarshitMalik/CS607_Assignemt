Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
Meeting with the Holy people, my mind blossoms forth. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a 
sacrifice, a sacrifice to those Holy beings; joining the Sangat, the Congregation, I am 
carried across to the other side.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   O Lord, Har, Har, please bless me 
with Your Mercy, God, that I may fall at the feet of the Holy. Blessed, blessed are the 
Holy, who know the Lord God. Meeting with the Holy, even sinners are saved.  || 1 ||   
The mind roams and rambles all around in all directions. Meeting with the Holy, it is 
overpowered and brought under control, just as when the fisherman spreads his net 
over the water, he catches and overpowers the fish.  || 2 ||   The Saints, the Saints of 
the Lord, are noble and good. Meeting with the humble Saints, filth is washed away. All 
the sinful residues of egotism are washed away, like soap washing dirty clothes.  || 3 ||   
According  to  that  pre-ordained  destiny  inscribed  on  my  forehead  by  my  Lord  and 
Master, I have enshrined the Feet of the Guru, the True Guru, within my heart. I have 
found God, the Destroyer of all poverty and pain; servant Nanak is saved through the 
Naam.  || 4 || 1 ||   KAANRAA,  FOURTH MEHL:  My mind is the dust of the feet of the 
Saints. Joining the Sangat, the Congregation, I listen to the sermon of the Lord, Har, 
Har.  My  crude  and uncultured mind is drenched with  the Love of the Lord.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   I am thoughtless and unconscious; I do not know God‟s state and extent. 
The Guru has made me thoughtful and conscious. God is Merciful to the meek; He has 
made me His Own. My mind chants and meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  
|| 1 ||   Meeting with the Lord‟s Saints, the Beloveds of the mind, I would cut out my 
heart, and offer it to them. Meeting with the Lord‟s Saints, I meet with the Lord; this 
sinner has been sanctified.  || 2 ||   The humble servants of the Lord are said to be 
exalted in this world; meeting with them, even stones are softened.
