  347    Numbers 15 
26  and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of 
Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the 
 
people were in ignorance. 
27  ¶ And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she 
goat of the first year for a sin offering. 
28  And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth 
ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to 
make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.  
 
29  Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both 
for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the 
stranger that sojourneth among them. 
30  But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in 
the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that 
 
soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
31  Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken 
his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity 
 
shall be upon him. 
The Stoning of a Sabbath Breaker 
32  ¶ And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they 
found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 
33  And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses 
and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
34  And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should 
be done to him. 
35  And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to 
death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the 
 
camp. 
36  And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and 
stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses.
