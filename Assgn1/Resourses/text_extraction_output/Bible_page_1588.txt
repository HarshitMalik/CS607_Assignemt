  1589    Isaiah 54 
54 
The Lord’s Everlasting Love for Israel 
1  Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, 
 
and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are 
 
the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, 
saith the Lord. 
2  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains 
of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen 
 
thy stakes; 
 
3  for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy 
 
seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be 
inhabited. 
4  ¶ Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou 
   
confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt 
   
forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the 
reproach of thy widowhood any more. 
5  For thy Maker is thine husband; The Lord of hosts is his name; 
   
and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole 
 
earth shall he be called. 
6  For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in 
spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 
7  For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies 
 
will I gather thee. 
8  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with 
 
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy 
Redeemer. 
9  ¶ For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that 
 
the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I 
 
sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. 
10  For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my 
 
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of 
my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.
