remnant of Israel? 
 
The Promise of Restoration and Renewal 
14  ¶ Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
15  Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy 
kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: 
 
unto us is this land given in possession. 
16  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Although I have cast them 
 
far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them 
among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in 
the countries where they shall come. 
17  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; I will even gather you 
 
from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye 
have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 
18  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the 
detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from 
thence. 
19  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within 
you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give 
 
them a heart of flesh: 
 
20  that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and 
do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  
 
21  But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their 
detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their 
way upon their own heads, saith the Lord God. 
22  ¶ Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside 
them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
 
23  And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and 
stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.  
24  Afterward the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the 
Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision 
that I had seen went up from me.
