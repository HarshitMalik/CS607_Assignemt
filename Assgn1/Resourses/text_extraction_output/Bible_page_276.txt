  277    Leviticus 20 
12  And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely 
be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be 
   
upon them.  
13  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of 
them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to 
 
death; their blood shall be upon them.  
 
14  And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they 
 
shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no 
 
wickedness among you.  
15  And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye 
 
shall slay the beast. 
16  And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, 
thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to 
 
death; their blood shall be upon them.  
 
17  ¶ And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his 
mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his 
nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight 
   
of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall 
   
bear his iniquity.  
18  And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall 
uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she 
 
hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall 
 
be cut off from among their people.  
19  And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, 
nor of thy father’s sister; for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall 
   
bear their iniquity. 
20  And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his 
uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.  
   
21  And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing: he 
 
hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.  
 
22  ¶ Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and 
do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spew 
 
you not out.
