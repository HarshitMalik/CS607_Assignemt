  608    Judges 20 
38  Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and 
the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke 
rise up out of the city. 
39  And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began 
to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they 
 
said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle. 
40  But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of 
smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame 
of the city ascended up to heaven. 
41  And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin 
were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. 
 
42  Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the 
way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them 
   
which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. 
43  Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, 
and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the 
sunrising. 
44  And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were 
 
men of valor. 
45  And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of 
Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand 
 
men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two 
 
thousand men of them. 
46  So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five 
thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor. 
 
47  But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the 
rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 
48  And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, 
and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of 
every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on 
 
fire all the cities that they came to.
