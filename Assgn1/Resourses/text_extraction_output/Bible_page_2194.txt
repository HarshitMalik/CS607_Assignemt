  2195    Luke 11 
34  The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, 
 
thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy 
 
body also is full of darkness. 
35  Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkness. 
36  If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the 
whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle 
doth give thee light. 
Jesus Denounces the Pharisees and Lawyers 
37  ¶ And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with 
him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
 
38  And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first 
washed before dinner. 
39  And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the 
outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of 
 
ravening and wickedness. 
40  Ye fools, did not he, that made that which is without, make that 
which is within also? 
 
41  But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all 
 
things are clean unto you. 
42  ¶ But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all 
 
manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: 
 
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 
43  Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the 
 
synagogues, and greetings in the markets. 
44  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as 
 
graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not 
aware of them. 
45  ¶ Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, 
thus saying thou reproachest us also. 
46  And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with 
 
burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the 
burdens with one of your fingers.
