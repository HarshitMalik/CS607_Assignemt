beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were 
 
dead, took for his own daughter. 
8  So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree 
was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto 
Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was 
brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper 
of the women. 
9  And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; 
 
and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such 
things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be 
given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her 
 
maids unto the best place of the house of the women. 
10  Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai 
 
had charged her that she should not show it. 
11  And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s 
house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. 
12  ¶ Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king 
Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the 
manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications 
accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months 
with sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of the 
women,) 
13  then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired 
 
was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto 
the king’s house. 
14  In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the 
second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s 
chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the 
 
king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were 
called by name. 
15  ¶ Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle 
of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in 
unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s 
chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther 
obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
