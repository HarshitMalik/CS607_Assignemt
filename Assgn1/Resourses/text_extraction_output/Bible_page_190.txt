  191    Exodus 28 
20  And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be 
 
set in gold in their inclosings. 
21  And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, 
twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; 
 
every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve 
tribes. 
22  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of 
wreathed work of pure gold. 
23  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and 
shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
24  And thou shalt put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings 
which are on the ends of the breastplate. 
25  And the other two ends of the two wreathed chains thou shalt fasten 
in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod 
before it. 
26  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them 
upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is 
in the side of the ephod inward. 
27  And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on 
the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, 
over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of 
the ephod. 
28  And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the 
rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the 
curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed 
from the ephod. 
29  And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the 
breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the 
holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually. 
30  And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the 
Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart, when he goeth in 
 
before the Lord: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the 
 
children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually. 
31  ¶ And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
