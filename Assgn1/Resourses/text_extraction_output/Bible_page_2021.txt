  2022    Matthew 6 
Love for Enemies 
38  ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a 
tooth for a tooth:  
 
39  but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall 
 
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 
40  And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let 
him have thy cloak also. 
41  And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
42  Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of 
thee turn not thou away. 
43  ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor, and hate thine enemy. 
44  But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, 
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which 
despitefully use you, and persecute you; 
 
45  that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for 
 
he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth 
rain on the just and on the unjust. 
46  For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not 
 
even the publicans the same? 
 
47  And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do 
 
not even the publicans so? 
 
48  Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is 
perfect.

Jesus’ Teaching on Almsgiving 
1  Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: 
 
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 
2  ¶ Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet 
before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
