  1436    Proverbs 19 
he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
9  A false witness shall not be unpunished; 
 
and he that speaketh lies shall perish. 
10  Delight is not seemly for a fool; 
 
much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 
11  The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; 
 
and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 
12  The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; 
 
but his favor is as dew upon the grass. 
13  A foolish son is the calamity of his father: 
 
and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 
14  House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: 
 
and a prudent wife is from the Lord. 
15  Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; 
 
and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 
16  He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; 
 
but he that despiseth his ways shall die. 
17  He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; 
 
and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 
18  Chasten thy son while there is hope, 
and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 
19  A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: 
 
for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. 
20  Hear counsel, and receive instruction, 
that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 
21  There are many devices in a man’s heart; 
 
nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand. 
22  The desire of a man is his kindness: 
 
and a poor man is better than a liar. 
23  The fear of the Lord tendeth to life: 
 
and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; 
 
he shall not be visited with evil. 
24  A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, 
and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 
25  Smite a scorner,
