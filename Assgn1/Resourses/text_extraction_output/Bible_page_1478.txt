  1479    Ecclesiastes 12 
8  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. 
 
The Whole Duty of Man 
9  ¶ And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the 
people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set 
 
in order many proverbs. 
10  The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which 
 
was written was upright, even words of truth. 
11  ¶ The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the 
masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. 
12  And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many 
 
books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. 
 
13  ¶ Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and 
 
keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 
 
14  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret 
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
