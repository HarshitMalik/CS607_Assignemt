  514    Joshua 9 
11  Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake 
to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet 
them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now 
 
make ye a league with us. 
12  This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on 
the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, 
 
and it is mouldy: 
 
13  and these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, 
 
they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old 
 
by reason of the very long journey. 
14  And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the 
mouth of the Lord. 
15  And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, 
to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto 
 
them. 
16  ¶ And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a 
league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, 
and that they dwelt among them. 
17  And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on 
the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and 
Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim. 
18  And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of 
the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel. 
And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
19  But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn 
unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not 
 
touch them. 
20  This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be 
 
upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
21  And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be 
 
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as 
 
the princes had promised them. 
22  ¶ And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, 
Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; 
 
when ye dwell among us?
