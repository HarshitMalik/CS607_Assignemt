  1755    Ezekiel 2 
23  And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward 
the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every 
 
one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 
24  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the 
noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of 
speech, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their 
 
wings. 
25  And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their 
heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. 
26  ¶ And above the firmament that was over their heads was the 
likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and 
 
upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance 
of a man above upon it.  
27  And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round 
about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and 
from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were 
the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.  
28  As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, 
so was the appearance of the brightness round about. 
¶ This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. 
And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one 
that spake.

The Call of Ezekiel 
1  And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will 
speak unto thee. 
2  And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me 
upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
3  And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of 
Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and 
 
their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.
