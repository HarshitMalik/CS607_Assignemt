  2296    John 18 
18  And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of 
coals, for it was cold; and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood 
   
with them, and warmed himself. 
The High Priest Questions Jesus 
19  ¶ The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his 
doctrine. 
20  Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in 
 
the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; 
 
and in secret have I said nothing. 
21  Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said 
 
unto them: behold, they know what I said. 
 
22  And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by 
struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the 
high priest so? 
 
23  Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: 
 
but if well, why smitest thou me? 
 
24  Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
Peter Denies Jesus 
25  ¶ And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore 
unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and 
 
said, I am not. 
26  One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear 
Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
 
27  Peter then denied again; and immediately the cock crew. 
 
Jesus before Pilate 
28  ¶ Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and 
 
it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, 
 
lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
