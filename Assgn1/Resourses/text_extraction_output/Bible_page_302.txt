  303    Numbers 1 
39  those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were 
threescore and two thousand and seven hundred. 
40  ¶ Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, 
by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the 
names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go 
forth to war; 
 
41  those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were 
forty and one thousand and five hundred. 
42  ¶ Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations, after 
their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the 
number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that 
were able to go forth to war; 
 
43  those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, 
were fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 
44  ¶ These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron 
numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one 
 
was for the house of his fathers. 
45  So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by 
the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all 
that were able to go forth to war in Israel; 
 
46  even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and 
three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
The Appointment of the Levites 
47  ¶ But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered 
among them. 
48  For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, 
49  Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum 
of them among the children of Israel: 
 
50  but thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, 
and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: 
 
they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they 
 
shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the 
tabernacle.
