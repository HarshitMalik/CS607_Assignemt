  1989    Zechariah 6 
7  And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to 
and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and 
 
fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
8  Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these 
that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the 
north country. 
The Symbolic Crowning of Joshua 
9  ¶ And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
10  Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of 
Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same 
day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
 
11  then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the 
head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
 
12  and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, 
saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall 
 
grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: 
 
13  even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the 
 
glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest 
 
upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them 
 
both. 
14  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, 
and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of 
the Lord. 
15  ¶ And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the 
Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto 
you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice 
of the Lord your God.
