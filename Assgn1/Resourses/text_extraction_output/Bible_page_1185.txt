  1186    Job 34 
and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
21  For his eyes are upon the ways of man, 
and he seeth all his goings. 
22  There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, 
where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 
23  For he will not lay upon man more than right; 
 
that he should enter into judgment with God. 
24  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, 
and set others in their stead. 
25  Therefore he knoweth their works, 
and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
26  He striketh them as wicked men 
in the open sight of others; 
 
27  because they turned back from him, 
and would not consider any of his ways: 
 
28  so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, 
and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 
29  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? 
 
And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? 
 
whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 
 
30  that the hypocrite reign not, 
lest the people be ensnared. 
31  Surely it is meet to be said unto God, 
I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: 
 
32  that which I see not teach thou me: 
 
if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 
33  Should it be according to thy mind? He will recompense it, 
 
whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: 
   
therefore speak what thou knowest. 
34  Let men of understanding tell me, 
and let a wise man hearken unto me. 
35  Job hath spoken without knowledge, 
and his words were without wisdom. 
36  My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end, 
because of his answers for wicked men.
