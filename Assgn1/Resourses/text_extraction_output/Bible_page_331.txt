  332    Numbers 10 
9  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth 
you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be 
 
remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from 
your enemies. 
10  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in 
the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets 
over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace 
offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: 
   
I am the Lord your God. 
The Israelites Depart from Sinai 
11  ¶ And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in 
the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle 
of the testimony. 
12  And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness 
of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. 
 
13  And they first took their journey according to the commandment 
of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
14  In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of 
Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the 
 
son of Amminadab. 
15  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was 
Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 
16  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab 
the son of Helon. 
17  ¶ And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and 
 
the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle. 
18  And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to 
their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
 
19  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was 
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
20  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph 
the son of Deuel.
