BHAGAVAD GITA
30. He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he does not become separated
from Me nor do I become separated from him.
COMMENTARY: The Lord describes here the effect of oneness.
Sarvabhootasthitam yo maam bhajatyekatwamaasthitah;
Sarvathaa vartamaano’pi sa yogee mayi vartate.
31. He who, being established in unity, worships Me who dwells in all beings,—that Yogi
abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.
Aatmaupamyena sarvatra samam pashyati yo’rjuna;
Sukham vaa yadi vaa duhkham sa yogee paramo matah.
32. He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees equality everywhere, be it
pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Yo’yam yogastwayaa proktah saamyena madhusoodana;
Etasyaaham na pashyaami chanchalatwaat sthitim sthiraam.
Arjuna said:
33. This Yoga of equanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance,
because of restlessness (of the mind)!
Chanchalam hi manah krishna pramaathi balavad dridham;
Tasyaaham nigraham manye vaayoriva sudushkaram.
34. The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna! I deem it as
difficult to control as to control the wind.
COMMENTARY: The mind ever changes its point of concentration from one object to
another. So it is always restless. It is not only restless but also turbulent and impetuous, strong and
obstinate. It produces agitation in the body and in the senses. That is why the mind is even more
difficult to control than to control the wind.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Asamshayam mahaabaaho mano durnigraham chalam;
Abhyaasena tu kaunteya vairaagyena cha grihyate.
The Blessed Lord said:
35. Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but,
by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained!
