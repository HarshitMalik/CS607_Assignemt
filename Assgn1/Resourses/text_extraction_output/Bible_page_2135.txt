  2136    Mark 13 
The Widow’s Offering 
41  ¶ And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the 
people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast 
 
in much. 
42  And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, 
which make a farthing. 
43  And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I 
say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they 
which have cast into the treasury: 
 
44  for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did 
 
cast in all that she had, even all her living. 
13 
The Destruction of the Temple and Signs before the End 
1  And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto 
him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are 
here! 
 
2  And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great 
buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall 
 
not be thrown down. 
3  ¶ And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, 
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
4  Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when 
 
all these things shall be fulfilled? 
 
5  And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man 
deceive you: 
 
6  for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall 
 
deceive many. 
7  And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be ye not 
troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
