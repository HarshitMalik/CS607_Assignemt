  2327    Acts 8 
8 
And Saul was consenting unto his death. 
Saul Persecutes the Church 
1  ¶ And at that time there was a great persecution against the church 
which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad 
 
throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
2  And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great 
lamentation over him. 
3  As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every 
house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.  
The Gospel Preached in Samaria 
4  ¶ Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where 
preaching the word. 
5  Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ 
unto them. 
6  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which 
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
7  For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that 
were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that 
 
were lame, were healed. 
8  And there was great joy in that city. 
9  ¶ But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in 
the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, 
giving out that himself was some great one: 
 
10  to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, 
This man is the great power of God. 
11  And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had 
bewitched them with sorceries.
