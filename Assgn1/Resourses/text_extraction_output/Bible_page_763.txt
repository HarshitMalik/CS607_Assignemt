  764    1 Kings 2 
11  And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven 
 
years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he 
in Jerusalem.  
12  Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his 
 
kingdom was established greatly. 
Solomon Establishes His Kingdom 
13  ¶ And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother 
of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, 
 
Peaceably. 
14  He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, 
Say on. 
15  And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all

17  And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he 
will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to 
wife.

19  ¶ Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto 
him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed 
himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to 
be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
 
20  Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me 
 
not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will 
 
not say thee nay. 
21  And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah 
thy brother to wife. 
22  And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why 
dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
