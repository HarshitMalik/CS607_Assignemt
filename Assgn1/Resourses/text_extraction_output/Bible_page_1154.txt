  1155    Job 16 
32  It shall be accomplished before his time, 
and his branch shall not be green. 
33  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, 
and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 
34  For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, 
and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
35  They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, 
and their belly prepareth deceit.

Job Complains of God’s Dealings 
1  Then Job answered and said, 
2  I have heard many such things: 
 
miserable comforters are ye all. 
3  Shall vain words have an end? 
 
Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 
 
4  I also could speak as ye do: 
 
if your soul were in my soul’s stead, 
I could heap up words against you, 
and shake mine head at you. 
5  But I would strengthen you with my mouth, 
and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief. 
6  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: 
 
and though I forbear, what am I eased? 
 
7  But now he hath made me weary: 
 
thou hast made desolate all my company. 
8  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: 
 
and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 
9  He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: 
 
he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; 
 
mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
10  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; 
 
they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully;
