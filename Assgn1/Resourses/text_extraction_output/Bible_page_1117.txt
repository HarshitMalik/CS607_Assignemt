were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every 
province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after 
their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and 
 
sealed with the king’s ring. 
13  And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to 
destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, 
little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day 
of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil 
of them for a prey. 
14  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every 
province was published unto all people, that they should be ready 
against that day. 
15  The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, 
and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and 
Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

Esther Promises to Intercede for Her People 
1  When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his 
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the 
midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 
 
2  and came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the 
 
king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. 
3  And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment 
and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and 
fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and 
 
ashes. 
4  ¶ So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. 
Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to 
 
clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he 
 
received it not.
