  2578    James 2 
12  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of 
liberty. 
13  For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no 
mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 
 
Faith without Works Is Dead 
14  ¶ What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, 
and have not works? can faith save him? 
   
15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 
16  and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and 
filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are 
 
needful to the body; what doth it profit? 
   
17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 
18  ¶ Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me 
 
thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my 
works. 
19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils 
   
also believe, and tremble. 
20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
 
21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had 
offered Isaac his son upon the altar?  
 
22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was 
faith made perfect? 
 
23  And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, 
Abraham believed God, 
and it was imputed unto him for righteousness:  
 
and he was called the Friend of God.  
24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith 
only. 
25  Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when 
she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another 
way?  
 
26  For as the body without the spirit [or, breath] is dead, so faith 
without works is dead also.
