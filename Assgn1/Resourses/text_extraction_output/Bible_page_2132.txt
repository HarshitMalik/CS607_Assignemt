  2133    Mark 12 
6  Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also 
last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
7  But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; 
 
come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. 
8  And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the 
vineyard. 
9  What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and 
 
destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. 
10  And have ye not read this Scripture; 
 
The stone which the builders rejected 
is become the head of the corner: 
 
11  this was the Lord’s doing, 
and it is marvelous in our eyes? 
 
12  ¶ And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people; for 
 
they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they 
 
left him, and went their way. 
Paying Taxes to Caesar 
13  ¶ And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the 
Herodians, to catch him in his words. 
14  And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know 
that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the 
 
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to 
 
give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
 
15  Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their 
 
hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, 
 
that I may see it. 
16  And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image 
and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s. 
 
17  And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things 
that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they 
marveled at him.
