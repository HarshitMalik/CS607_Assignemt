  337    Numbers 12 
gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for 
 
themselves round about the camp. 
33  And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, 
the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the 
Lord smote the people with a very great plague. 
34  And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah [the graves 
of lust]: because there they buried the people that lusted. 
 
35  And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; 
 
and abode at Hazeroth.

Miriam and Aaron Speak against Moses 
1  And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the 
Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an 
 
Ethiopian woman. 
2  And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath 
 
he not spoken also by us? And the Lord heard it. 
 
3  (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were 
upon the face of the earth.) 
4  And the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and 
unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the 
congregation. And they three came out. 
5  And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in 
the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they 
 
both came forth. 
6  And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, 
 
I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will 
speak unto him in a dream. 
7  My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.  
8  With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not 
in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold: 
   
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant 
Moses?
