Before  we  are  born,  the  clarity  or  turbidity  of  our
endowment  of  energy  comes  from  God’s  bestowal—
humans can have nothing to do with it. After we are born,
perversity or rectitude of human character comes from our
own making—God cannot oversee it.
As heaven and earth give birth to human beings, those
of  higher  intelligence  are  of  course  few;  those  of  basest
folly  are  also  few.  It  is  the  middling  who  are  most
numerous.  Middling  people  can  strengthen  themselves
until  they  are  not  different  from  those  of  higher
intelligence;  but  if  middling  people  neglect  themselves,
how are they different from the lowest fools?
People  today  only  know  they  are  offspring  of  their
parents; they do not realize that they and their parents are
all  offspring  of  the  Way.  Therefore  superior  people
invariably  seek  to  attain  the  Way,  so  they  will  thereafter
have nothing to be ashamed of before heaven and earth, no
disgrace before heaven and earth.
Master Geng said, “The Way of the wise kings Wen and
Wu has not yet collapsed; it is in people. It was not only in
the  people  of  the  past;  it  is  also  in  people  of  the  present
age. It is not only in people of the present age; it will also
be  in  people  of  the  future.”  When  a  person  is  born,  a
person has one body; in each body is a real human being.
The  spiritual  subtlety  of  a  real  human  communes  with
heaven and earth; the clarity and calm of a real human is
free from dust. The real human has never grown more or
less; the real human being has never died or been born. If
