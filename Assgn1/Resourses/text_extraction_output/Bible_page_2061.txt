  2062    Matthew 19 
33  shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, 
even as I had pity on thee? 
 
34  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till 
he should pay all that was due unto him. 
35  So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from 
your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

Jesus’ Teaching on Divorce 
1  And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he 
departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond 
Jordan; 
 
2  and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. 
 
3  ¶ The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying 
unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every 
cause? 
 
4  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he 
which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  
5  and said, 
For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, 
and shall cleave to his wife: 
 
and they twain shall be one flesh? 
 
6  Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore 
God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
7  They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a 
writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  
 
8  He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts 
suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was 
 
not so. 
9  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be 
for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and 
 
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
