  655    1 Samuel 16 
35  And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: 
 
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented 
 
that he had made Saul king over Israel. 
16 
David Anointed King 
1  And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for 
Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine 
 
horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for 
 
I have provided me a king among his sons. 
2  And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And 
 
the Lord said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to 
sacrifice to the Lord. 
3  And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt 
do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. 
 
4  And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to 
Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and 
said, Comest thou peaceably? 
 
5  And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: 
   
sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he 
sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 
6  ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on 
Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord’s anointed is before him. 
7  But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or 
on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the 
   
Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward 
 
appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. 
8  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And 
he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this. 
9  Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath 
the Lord chosen this. 
10  Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And 
Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.
