  1394    Psalms 144 
for thou art my God: 
 
thy Spirit is good; 
 
lead me into the land of uprightness. 
11  Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name’s sake: 
 
for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble. 
12  And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, 
and destroy all them that afflict my soul: 
 
for I am thy servant.

A Prayer for Rescue and Prosperity 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Blessed be the Lord my strength, 
which teacheth my hands to war, 
and my fingers to fight: 
 
2  my goodness, and my fortress; 
 
my high tower, and my deliverer; 
 
my shield, and he in whom I trust; 
 
who subdueth my people under me. 
3  Lord, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! 
 
or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!  
 
4  Man is like to vanity: 
 
his days are as a shadow that passeth away. 
5  Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: 
 
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 
6  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: 
 
shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. 
7  Send thine hand from above; 
 
rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, 
from the hand of strange children; 
 
8  whose mouth speaketh vanity, 
and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
