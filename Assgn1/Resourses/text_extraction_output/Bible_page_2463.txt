  2464    2 Corinthians 6 
2  (For he saith, 
I have heard thee in a time accepted, 
and in the day of salvation have I succored thee:  
 
Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of 
 
salvation.) 
3  Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
 
4  but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in 
much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
5  in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in 
fastings; 
 
6  by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the 
Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
7  by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of 
righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
8  by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as 
 
deceivers, and yet true; 
 
9  as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as 
   
chastened, and not killed; 
 
10  as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as 
   
having nothing, and yet possessing all things. 
11  ¶ O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is 
enlarged. 
12  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own 
bowels. 
13  Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) 
be ye also enlarged. 
Ye Are the Temple of the Living God 
14  ¶ Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what 
 
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what 
 
communion hath light with darkness? 
 
15  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he 
 
that believeth with an infidel?
