  266    Leviticus 16 
16 
The Day of Atonement 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of 
Aaron, when they offered before the Lord, and died; 
 
2  and the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that 
he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before 
the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will 
   
appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat. 
3  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place; with a young bullock for 
 
a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.  
4  He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen 
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and 
with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; 
   
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. 
5  And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two 
kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 
6  ¶ And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for 
himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 
7  And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord 
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
8  And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, 
 
and the other lot for the scapegoat. 
9  And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell, and 
offer him for a sin offering. 
10  But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be 
presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, 
and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. 
11  ¶ And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for 
himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his 
house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for 
himself:
