  2583    James 5 
13  ¶ Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him 
   
sing psalms. 
14  Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and 
   
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the 
Lord: 
 
15  and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise 
him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
 
16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that 
ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man 
availeth much. 
17  Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed 
earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by 
 
the space of three years and six months.  
18  And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth 
brought forth her fruit. 
19  ¶ Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert 
him; 
 
20  let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error 
of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude 
of sins.
