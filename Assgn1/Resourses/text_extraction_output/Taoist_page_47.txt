you  see  profit  you  think  there  is  harm  there,  thoughts  of
grabbing it will inevitably stop.

Small people accumulate wealth. Wealth can support the
body,  but  it  can  also  damage  the  body.  Therefore  people
with  a  lot  of  wealth  may  want  to  leave  worry  and
apprehension behind but cannot.

Something  that  cannot  be  done  should  not  be  forced—
