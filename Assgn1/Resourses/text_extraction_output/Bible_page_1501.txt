  1502    Isaiah 5 
19  that say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see 
it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and 
 
come, that we may know it! 
 
20  Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness 
 
for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet 
 
for bitter! 
 
21  Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their 
own sight! 
 
22  Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength 
to mingle strong drink: 
 
23  which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the 
righteousness of the righteous from him! 
 
24  ¶ Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame 
consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their 
blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of 
 
the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
25  Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and 
he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten 
them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the 
 
midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his 
hand is stretched out still. 
26  ¶ And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss 
unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come 
 
with speed swiftly: 
 
27  none shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber 
 
nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the 
 
latchet of their shoes be broken: 
 
28  whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs 
shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 
 
29  their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions; 
 
yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away 
safe, and none shall deliver it. 
30  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the 
sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow; and 
   
the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
