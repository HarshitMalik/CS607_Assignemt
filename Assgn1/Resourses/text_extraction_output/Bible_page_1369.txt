  1370    Psalms 119 
for they have made void thy law. 
127  Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; 
 
yea, above fine gold. 
128  Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; 
 
and I hate every false way. 
pe 
129  Thy testimonies are wonderful: 
 
therefore doth my soul keep them. 
130  The entrance of thy words giveth light; 
 
it giveth understanding unto the simple. 
131  I opened my mouth, and panted: 
 
for I longed for thy commandments. 
132  Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, 
as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 
133  Order my steps in thy word: 
 
and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 
134  Deliver me from the oppression of man: 
 
so will I keep thy precepts. 
135  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; 
 
and teach me thy statutes. 
136  Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, 
because they keep not thy law.

137  Righteous art thou, O Lord, 
and upright are thy judgments. 
138  Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded 
are righteous and very faithful. 
139  My zeal hath consumed me, 
because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. 
140  Thy word is very pure: 
 
therefore thy servant loveth it. 
141  I am small and despised: 
 
yet do not I forget thy precepts. 
142  Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, 
and thy law is the truth.
