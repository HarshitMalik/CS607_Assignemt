THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE DIVINE AND THE DEMONIACAL
Dayaa bhooteshvaloluptwam maardavam hreerachaapalam.
2. Harmlessness, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of
crookedness, compassion towards beings, uncovetousness, gentleness, modesty, absence of
fickleness,
Tejah kshamaa dhritih shauchamadroho naatimaanitaa;
Bhavanti sampadam daiveem abhijaatasya bhaarata.
3. Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pride—these belong
to one born in a divine state, O Arjuna!
Dambho darpo’bhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyameva cha;
Ajnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem.
4. Hypocrisy, arrogance, self-conceit, harshness and also anger and ignorance, belong to
one who is born in a demoniacal state, O Arjuna!
Daivee sampadvimokshaaya nibandhaayaasuree mataa;
Maa shuchah sampadam daiveem abhijaato’si paandava.
5. The divine nature is deemed for liberation and the demoniacal for bondage. Grieve not, O
Arjuna, for thou art born with divine properties!
COMMENTARY: As Arjuna is dejected, Sri Krishna assures him not to feel alarmed at
this description of the demoniacal qualities as he is born with Sattwic tendencies leading towards
salvation.
Dwau bhootasargau loke’smin daiva aasura eva cha;
Daivo vistarashah proktah aasuram paartha me shrinu.
6. There are two types of beings in this world—the divine and the demoniacal; the divine
has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal!
Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha janaa na viduraasuraah;
Na shaucham naapi chaachaaro na satyam teshu vidyate.
7. The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity nor right
conduct nor truth is found in them.
Asatyamapratishtham te jagadaahuraneeshwaram;
Aparasparasambhootam kimanyat kaamahaitukam.
8. They say: “This universe is without truth, without a (moral) basis, without a God, brought
about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?”
