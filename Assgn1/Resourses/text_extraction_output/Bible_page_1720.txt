  1721    Jeremiah 48 
37  ¶ For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the 
 
hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
38  There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of 
Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a 
 
vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the Lord. 
39  They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab 
 
turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a 
 
dismaying to all them about him. 
40  ¶ For thus saith the Lord; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and 
 
shall spread his wings over Moab. 
41  Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are surprised, and the mighty 
men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in 
her pangs. 
42  And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath 
magnified himself against the Lord. 
43  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of 
Moab, saith the Lord. 
44  He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that 
 
getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring 
 
upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the 
Lord. 
45  ¶ They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the 
force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from 
 
the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the 
crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 
46  Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for 
   
thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. 
47  Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith 
the Lord. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
