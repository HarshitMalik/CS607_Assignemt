  1116    Esther 3 
16  So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in 
the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of 
his reign. 
17  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained 
grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set 
 
the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of 
Vashti. 
18  Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his 
servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, 
 
and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. 
Mordecai Reveals a Conspiracy against the King 
19  ¶ And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, 
then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate. 
20  Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai 
had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, 
 
like as when she was brought up with him. 
21  In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the 
king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the 
door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
22  And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the 
queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name. 
 
23  And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; 
 
therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in 
 
the book of the chronicles before the king.

Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat 
above all the princes that were with him.
