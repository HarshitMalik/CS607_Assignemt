  1785    Ezekiel 17 
53  ¶ When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom 
and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, 
then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of 
them: 
 
54  that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded 
in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 
55  When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their 
former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their 
former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your 
former estate. 
56  For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of 
thy pride, 
57  before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach 
of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the 
daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about. 
58  Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the 
Lord. 
59  ¶ For thus saith the Lord God; I will even deal with thee as thou 
 
hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
60  Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days 
of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 
61  Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou 
shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give 
 
them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 
62  And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know 
 
that I am the Lord: 
 
63  that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open 
thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified 
toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.
