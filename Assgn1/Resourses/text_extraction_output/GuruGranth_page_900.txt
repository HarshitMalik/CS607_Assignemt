Sing the songs of Praise of the Lord. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, total 
peace is obtained; coming and going is ended, my friend.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Singing 
the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one is enlightened, and comes to dwell in His lotus 
feet.  || 1 ||   In the Society of the Saints, one is saved. O Nanak, he crosses over the 
terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 || 1 || 57 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  My Guru is 
perfect, my Guru is perfect. Chanting the Lord‟s Name, I am always at peace; all my 
illness and fraud is dispelled.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Worship and adore that One Lord 
alone. In His Sanctuary, eternal peace is obtained.  || 1 ||   One who feels hunger for 
the  Naam  sleeps  in  peace.  Meditating  in  remembrance  on  the  Lord,  all  pains  are 
dispelled.  Enjoy  celestial  bliss,  O  my  Siblings  of  Destiny.  The  Perfect  Guru  has 
eradicated all anxiety.  || 3 ||   Twenty-four hours a day, chant God‟s Chant. O Nanak, 
He Himself shall save you.  || 4 || 2 || 58 ||

NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
I humble bow to the Lord, the Supreme Being. The One, the One and Only Creator Lord 
permeates the water, the land, the earth and the sky.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Over and over 
again, the Creator Lord destroys, sustains and creates. He has no home; He needs no 
nourishment.  || 1 ||   The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is deep and profound, strong, 
poised, lofty, exalted and infinite. He stages His plays; His Virtues are priceless. Nanak 
is a sacrifice to Him.  || 2 || 1 || 59 ||   RAAMKALEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  You must abandon 
your beauty, pleasures, fragrances and enjoyments; beguiled by gold and sexual desire, 
you must still leave Maya behind.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You gaze upon billions and trillions 
of  treasures  and  riches, which  delight and comfort your  mind, but these will  not go 
along with you.  || 1 ||   Entangled with children, spouse, siblings and friends, you are 
enticed and fooled; these pass like the shadow of a tree. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of 
His lotus feet; He has found peace in the faith of the Saints.  || 2 || 2 || 60 ||

meditation, evil-mindedness is dispelled, and the state of Nirvaanaa is obtained.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   Know that one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is very fortunate.
