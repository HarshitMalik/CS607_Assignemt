34  How then comfort ye me in vain, 
seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?

Eliphaz Accuses Job of Great Wickedness 
1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
2  Can a man be profitable unto God, 
as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
 
3  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? 
 
Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?  
 
4  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? 
 
Will he enter with thee into judgment? 
 
5  Is not thy wickedness great? 
 
and thine iniquities infinite? 
 
6  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, 
and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
7  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, 
and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 
8  But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; 
 
and the honorable man dwelt in it. 
9  Thou hast sent widows away empty, 
and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
10  Therefore snares are round about thee, 
and sudden fear troubleth thee; 
 
11  or darkness, that thou canst not see; 
 
and abundance of waters cover thee. 
12  Is not God in the height of heaven? 
 
And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 
 
13  And thou sayest, How doth God know? 
 
Can he judge through the dark cloud? 
 
14  Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; 
 
and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
