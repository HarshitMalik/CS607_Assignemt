  1193    Job 38 
20  that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, 
and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 
 
21  Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? 
 
or because the number of thy days is great? 
 
22  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? 
 
Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 
23  which I have reserved against the time of trouble, 
against the day of battle and war? 
 
24  By what way is the light parted, 
which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 
 
25  Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, 
or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
 
26  to cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; 
 
on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 
 
27  to satisfy the desolate and waste ground; 
 
and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 
 
28  Hath the rain a father? 
 
Or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
 
29  Out of whose womb came the ice? 
 
And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 
 
30  The waters are hid as with a stone, 
and the face of the deep is frozen. 
31  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, 
or loose the bands of Orion?  
 
32  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? 
 
Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 
 
33  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? 
 
Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 
 
34  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, 
that abundance of waters may cover thee? 
 
35  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, 
and say unto thee, Here we are? 
 
36  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? 
 
Or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
 
37  Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
