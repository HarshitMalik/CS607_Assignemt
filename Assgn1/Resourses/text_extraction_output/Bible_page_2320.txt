  2321    Acts 6 
39  but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found 
 
even to fight against God. 
40  ¶ And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, 
 
and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in 
the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
41  And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that 
they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 
42  And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to 
teach and preach Jesus Christ.

The Appointment of the Seven 
1  And in those days, when the number of the disciples was 
multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the 
Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily 
ministration. 
2  Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and 
said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and 
serve tables. 
3  Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest 
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint 
over this business. 
4  But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the 
ministry of the word. 
5  And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose 
 
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and 
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a 
proselyte of Antioch; 
 
6  whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they 
 
laid their hands on them. 
7  ¶ And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples 
 
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests 
 
were obedient to the faith.
