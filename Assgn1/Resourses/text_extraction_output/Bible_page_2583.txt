The First Epistle General of 
Peter 
[1 Peter] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, 
¶ To the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, 
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
2  elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through 
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the 
blood of Jesus Christ: 
 
¶ Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. 
The Christian’s Hope and Salvation 
3  ¶ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which 
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a 
lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
4  to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not 
away, reserved in heaven for you, 
5  who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation 
ready to be revealed in the last time. 
6  Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye 
are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
 
7  that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold 
that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto 
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
 
8  whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him 
 
not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: 
 
9  receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. 
10  ¶ Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched 
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
