  1692    Jeremiah 35 
35 
The Obedience of the Rechabites 
1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, in the days of 
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
2  Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and 
bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, 
and give them wine to drink. 
3  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, 
and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the 
Rechabites; 
 
4  and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber 
of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was 
by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of 
Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 
 
5  and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of 
wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
 
6  But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of 
 
Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, 
neither ye, nor your sons for ever: 
 
7  neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor 
have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live 
   
many days in the land where ye be strangers. 
8  Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our 
father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, 
we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
 
9  nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, 
 
nor field, nor seed: 
 
10  but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to 
all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
11  But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up 
into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for 
fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the 
Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
