  2577    James 2 
26  ¶ If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his 
tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain. 
27  Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To 
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep 
himself unspotted from the world.

Warning against Partiality 
1  My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of 
glory, with respect of persons. 
2  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in 
goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 
 
3  and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say 
unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand 
 
thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 
 
4  are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil 
thoughts? 
 
5  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of 
this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath 
promised to them that love him? 
 
6  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and 
draw you before the judgment seats? 
 
7  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are 
called? 
 
8  ¶ If ye fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt 
love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well: 
 
9  but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced 
of the law as transgressors. 
10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one 
point, he is guilty of all. 
11  For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. 
Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a 
transgressor of the law.
