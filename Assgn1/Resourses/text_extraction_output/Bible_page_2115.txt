  2116    Mark 7 
2  And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, 
that is to say, with unwashen hands, they found fault. 
3  For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, 
eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 
4  And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat 
not. And many other things there be, which they have received to 
hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables. 
5  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy 
disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with 
unwashen hands? 
 
6  He answered and said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of 
you hypocrites, as it is written, 
This people honoreth me with their lips, 
but their heart is far from me. 
7  Howbeit in vain do they worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  
8  For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of 
men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like 
 
things ye do. 
9  ¶ And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of 
God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 
10  For Moses said, 
Honor thy father and thy mother;  
 
and, 
Whoso curseth father or mother, 
let him die the death:  
 
11  but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, 
that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
 
he shall be free. 
12  And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother; 
 
13  making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, 
which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. 
 
14  ¶ And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto 
them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:
