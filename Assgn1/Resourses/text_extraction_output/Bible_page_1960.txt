  1961    Micah 7 
10  Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her 
which said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall 
 
behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the 
 
streets. 
11  ¶ In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the 
decree be far removed. 
12  In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from 
the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from 
sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. 
13  Notwithstanding, the land shall be desolate because of them that 
dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. 
The Lord’s Compassion on Israel 
14  ¶ Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which 
dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed 
 
in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
15  According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I 
show unto him marvelous things. 
16  ¶ The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they 
 
shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. 
17  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their 
holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord our 
 
God, and shall fear because of thee. 
18  ¶ Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth 
by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth 
 
not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. 
19  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will 
 
subdue our iniquities: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the 
 
depths of the sea. 
20  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, 
which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
