  1789    Ezekiel 18 
13  hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then 
 
live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he 
     
shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. 
 
14  ¶ Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he 
hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 
15  that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his 
eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his 
neighbor’s wife, 
16  neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, 
neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the 
hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 
17  that hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received 
usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in 
my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall 
 
surely live. 
18  As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother 
by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, 
even he shall die in his iniquity. 
19  ¶ Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? 
   
When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath 
kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. 
20  The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the 
iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of 
the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and 
 
the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. 
God’s Way Is Just 
21  ¶ But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath 
committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful 
and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
22  All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be 
mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he 
 
shall live.
