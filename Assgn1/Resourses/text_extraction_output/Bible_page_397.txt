The Borders and Division of Canaan 
50  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan 
near Jericho, saying, 
51  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are 
passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 
 
52  then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before 
you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten 
images, and quite pluck down all their high places: 
 
53  and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: 
 
for I have given you the land to possess it. 
54  And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your 
families; and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to 
 
the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s inheritance 
 
shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of 
 
your fathers ye shall inherit. 
55  But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before 
you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of 
 
them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall 
vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
56  Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought 
to do unto them.
