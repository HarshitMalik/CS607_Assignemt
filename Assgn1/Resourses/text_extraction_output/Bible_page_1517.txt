  1518    Isaiah 14 
22  For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off 
from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith 
the Lord. 
23  I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: 
 
and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of 
hosts. 
Assyria to Be Destroyed 
24  ¶ The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, 
so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: 
   
25  that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains 
tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and 
 
his burden depart from off their shoulders. 
26  This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this 
 
is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 
27  For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? 
 
and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? 
 
The Oracle concerning Philistia 
28  ¶ In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 
29  ¶ Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that 
smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth 
 
a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. 
30  And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie 
down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall 
 
slay thy remnant. 
31  Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for 
     
there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in 
his appointed times. 
32  ¶ What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That 
 
the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust 
in it.
