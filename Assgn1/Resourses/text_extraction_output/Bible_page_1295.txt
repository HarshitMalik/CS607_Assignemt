The Fate of the Wicked 
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  Truly God is good to Israel, 
even to such as are of a clean heart. 
2  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; 
 
my steps had well-nigh slipped. 
3  For I was envious at the foolish, 
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
4  For there are no bands in their death: 
 
but their strength is firm. 
5  They are not in trouble as other men; 
 
neither are they plagued like other men. 
6  Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; 
 
violence covereth them as a garment. 
7  Their eyes stand out with fatness: 
 
they have more than heart could wish. 
8  They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: 
 
they speak loftily. 
9  They set their mouth against the heavens, 
and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
10  Therefore his people return hither: 
 
and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. 
11  And they say, How doth God know? 
 
And is there knowledge in the Most High? 
 
12  Behold, these are the ungodly,
