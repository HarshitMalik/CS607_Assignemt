  452    Deuteronomy 18 
5  For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to 
stand to minister in the name of the Lord, him and his sons for 
ever. 
6  ¶ And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where 
he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the 
place which the Lord shall choose; 
 
7  then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his 
brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the Lord. 
8  They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of 
the sale of his patrimony. 
Warning against Heathen Practices 
9  ¶ When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God 
giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of 
those nations. 
10  There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or 
his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an 
observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,  
11  or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a 
necromancer. 
12  For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and 
 
because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them 
out from before thee. 
13  Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.  
14  For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto 
observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy 
 
God hath not suffered thee so to do. 
God Promises a Prophet like Moses 
15  ¶ The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the 
midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall 
 
hearken;
