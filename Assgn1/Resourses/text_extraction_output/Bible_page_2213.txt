  2214    Luke 17 
13  and they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy 
on us. 
14  And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go show yourselves 
unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were 
cleansed. 
15  And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, 
and with a loud voice glorified God, 
16  and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was 
 
a Samaritan. 
17  And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where 
 
are the nine? 
 
18  There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this 
stranger. 
19  And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee 
 
whole. 
The Coming of the Kingdom 
20  ¶ And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom 
of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of 
God cometh not with observation: 
 
21  neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the 
   
kingdom of God is within you. 
22  ¶ And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall 
desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see 
it. 
23  And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, 
   
nor follow them. 
24  For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under 
heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the 
 
Son of man be in his day. 
25  But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this 
generation. 
26  And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of 
the Son of man.
