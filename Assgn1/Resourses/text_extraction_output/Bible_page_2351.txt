Timothy Accompanies Paul and Silas 
1  Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple 
 
was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, which was 
a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: 
   
2  which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and 
Iconium. 
3  Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and 
 
circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: 
 
for they knew all that his father was a Greek. 
4  And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the 
decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders 
which were at Jerusalem. 
5  And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in 
number daily. 
Paul’s Vision of the Man of Macedonia 
6  ¶ Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of 
Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word 
in Asia, 
7  after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but 
 
the Spirit suffered them not. 
8  And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. 
9  And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of 
 
Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, 
and help us. 
10  And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go 
into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for 
to preach the gospel unto them.
