The  second  selection  is  a  very  famous  manual  on
meditation,  Treatise  on  Sitting  Forgetting  by  Sima
Chengzhen  of  the  Tang  dynasty  (618–907).  The
cosmopolitan  culture  of  the  Tang  dynasty  has  often  been
called  the  golden  age  of  Chinese  civilization.  The  great
schools  of  Eastern  Buddhism  flourished  during  the  Tang
dynasty,  exerting  a  powerful  influence  on  the  subsequent
evolution  of  Confucianism  and  Taoism.  This  Treatise  on
Sitting  Forgetting  is  clearly  Taoistic,  yet  it  is  generally
phrased  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  Confucians  and
Buddhists. It is often quoted in later works on the subject
of Taoist meditation.
The third selection consists of sayings of Ma Danyang,
a  famous  Taoist  wizard  of  the  Song  dynasty  (960–1279).
Danyang,  whose  Taoist  name  means  Cinnabar  Sunlight,
was  one  of  the  great  disciples  of  Wang  Chongyang,  the
founder  of  the  Northern  Branch  of  Complete  Reality
Taoism,  a  powerful  neo-Taoist  movement  reviving  both
contemplative and social elements of Taoism. The austere
spirituality  of  the  Northern  Branch  of  Complete  Reality
Taoism is reminiscent of Chan, or Zen, Buddhism, which
many  neo-Taoists  studied,  but  it  is  also  an  organic
response to the problems and hardships of a society under
foreign occupation.
The  fourth  selection  is  taken  from  an  anthology  called
Secret  Writings  on  the  Mechanisms  of  Nature.  This  is  a
collection of excerpts from 163 sources of Taoist tradition,
including  ancient  classics,  writings  on  meditation  and
