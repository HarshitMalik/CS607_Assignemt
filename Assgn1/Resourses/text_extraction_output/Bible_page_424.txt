  425    Deuteronomy 7 
20  ¶ And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What 
mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which 
the Lord our God hath commanded you? 
 
21  then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in 
Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 
   
22  and the Lord showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon 
Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: 
 
23  and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to 
give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
24  And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the 
Lord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us 
alive, as it is at this day. 
25  And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these 
commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded 
us.

Israel Warned of the Idolatry of Canaan 
1  When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither 
thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, 
the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the 
Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, 
seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 
 
2  and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou 
 
shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no 
 
covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them: 
 
3  neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou 
 
shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto 
thy son. 
4  For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may 
serve other gods: so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against 
 
you, and destroy thee suddenly.
