  2144    Mark 15 
65  And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet 
him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike 
 
him with the palms of their hands. 
Peter Denies Jesus 
66  Â¶ And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the 
maids of the high priest: 
 
67  and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, 
and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
68  But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou 
sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. 
 
69  And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, 
This is one of them. 
70  And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said 
again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilean, 
 
and thy speech agreeth thereto. 
71  But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of 
whom ye speak. 
72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the 
word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou 
shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

Jesus before Pilate 
1  And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a 
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and 
bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 
2  And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he 
 
answering said unto him, Thou sayest it. 
3  And the chief priests accused him of many things; but he answered 
 
nothing.
