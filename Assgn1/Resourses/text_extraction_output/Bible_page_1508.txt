  1509    Isaiah 10 
16  For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led 
 
of them are destroyed. 
17  Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither 
shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is a 
 
hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all 
this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. 
18  Â¶ For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and 
 
thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall 
mount up like the lifting up of smoke. 
19  Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and 
the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his 
 
brother. 
20  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall 
 
eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat 
 
every man the flesh of his own arm: 
 
21  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together 
   
shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but 
his hand is stretched out still. 
10 
1  Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write 
grievousness which they have prescribed; 
 
2  to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right 
from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and 
that they may rob the fatherless! 
 
3  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation 
which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and 
   
where will ye leave your glory? 
 
4  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they 
shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, 
but his hand is stretched out still.
