In  the  course  of  human  life  it  is  inevitable  to  experience
things. Things are manifold, not up to one person alone.
A  bird  that  nests  on  one  branch  in  the  forest  would  be
lost  in  a  roosting  flock;  an  animal  that  fills  its  belly
drinking from a river does not go seeking in the ocean.
Finding  it  in  things  outside  and  understanding  it  in
yourself  within,  you  realize  you  have  your  lot  in  life  and
you do not strive for what is not in your lot. You take care
of things that are appropriate and do not take up things that
are not appropriate.
If  you  take  up  things  that  are  not  appropriate,  this
damages your intellectual power. If you strive for what is
beyond  you,  this  wears  out  your  body.  If  you  are
psychologically and physically uneasy, how can you reach
the Way?
For  this  reason,  nothing  is  better  for  people  who
cultivate  the  Way  than  to  resolutely  simplify  things.
Discern  whether  they  are  inessential  or  essential,  assess
whether they are trivial or serious, distinguish whether to
eliminate them or take to them. Whatever is not essential
and not serious should be abandoned.
It is like when people consume wine and meat, dress in
silk, enjoy fame and prestige, and possess gold and jewels.
These  are  all  excess  cravings  of  subjective  desire,  not
good  medicines  to  enhance  life.  The  masses  all  pursue
these things,  bringing  about  their  own  death  or  ruination.
If  we  reflect  on  this  quietly,  we  see  how  very  confused
they are.
