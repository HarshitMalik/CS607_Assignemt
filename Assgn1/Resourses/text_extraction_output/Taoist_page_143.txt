refine vitality into energy.
Turn attention around to gaze inwardly, freeze the spirit
in the alchemical opening, make the true breath circulate;
center  the  infinite  celestial  potential  within,  acting  when
stillness reaches its maximum, becoming still when action
reaches its maximum. This exercise is to refine energy into
spirit.
In  this  way  true  energy  gathers  at  the  source,  yin  and
yang return to the origin and mate; spontaneously the wind
grows still and the waves are calmed. At this time I keep
right mindfulness in the elixir field; this is the process of
“sealing.”
When you carry out these three practices, it is not just a
matter  of  going  into  retreat  for  ten  months;  as  it  is  said,
“When you operate the process for a quarter hour, there is
a  quarter-hour  cycle.  When  you  operate  it  for  an  hour,  a
day,  a  month,  or  a  year,  there  are  hour,  day,  month,  and
year cycles.”
So in one quarter hour, the first half of the quarter hour
is  the  “warming,”  the  “fostering  of  the  fire,”  the
“beginning  of  the  lunar  cycle,”  the  “first  phase  of  the
moon,” “difficulty in the morning,” “spring and summer.”
The  second  half  of  the  quarter  hour  is  the  “cooling,”  the
“withdrawing,”  the  “end  of  the  lunar  cycle,”  the  “last
phase  of  the  moon,”  “darkness  in  the  evening,”  “autumn
and winter.” In one double hour there are divisions of four
quarter hours in the first half and four quarter hours in the
second half. The same is true of a day, a month, or a year.
