  235    Leviticus 5 
31  And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away 
from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it 
 
upon the altar for a sweet savor unto the Lord; and the priest shall 
 
make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.  
32  Â¶ And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female 
without blemish. 
33  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and 
slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt 
offering. 
34  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his 
finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and 
shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 
 
35  and he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is 
taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest 
 
shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by 
fire unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for his 
 
sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

1  And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, 
whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he 
 
shall bear his iniquity. 
2  Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an 
unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of 
unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall 
 
be unclean, and guilty. 
3  Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it 
be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when 
 
he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty. 
4  Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do 
good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, 
and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be 
 
guilty in one of these.
