  181    Exodus 25 
10  and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it 
 
were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of 
heaven in his clearness. 
11  And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: 
 
also they saw God, and did eat and drink. 
12  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, 
and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and 
 
commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach 
 
them. 
13  And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua; and Moses went up 
 
into the mount of God. 
14  And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come 
again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any 
   
man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. 
15  ¶ And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the 
mount. 
16  And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud 
covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of 
 
the midst of the cloud. 
17  And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on 
the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
18  And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into 
the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty 
 
nights.

Israel to Bring an Offering 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of 
 
every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my 
offering. 
3  And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and 
 
silver, and brass,
