  1382    Psalms 133 
here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
 
15  I will abundantly bless her provision: 
 
I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
16  I will also clothe her priests with salvation: 
 
and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
17  There will I make the horn of David to bud: 
 
I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.  
18  His enemies will I clothe with shame: 
 
but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

The Blessings of Brotherly Unity 
A Song of degrees of David. 
1  Behold, how good and how pleasant it is 
for brethren to dwell together in unity! 
 
2  It is like the precious ointment upon the head, 
that ran down upon the beard, 
even Aaronâ€™s beard: 
 
that went down to the skirts of his garments; 
 
3  as the dew of Hermon, 
and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: 
 
for there the Lord commanded the blessing, 
even life for evermore.

Exhortation to the Night-watchers 
A Song of degrees. 
1  Behold, bless ye the Lord, 
all ye servants of the Lord,
