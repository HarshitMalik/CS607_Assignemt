  1312    Psalms 82 
10  I am the Lord thy God, 
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: 
 
open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
11  But my people would not hearken to my voice; 
 
and Israel would none of me. 
12  So I gave them up unto their own heartsâ€™ lust: 
 
and they walked in their own counsels. 
13  Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, 
and Israel had walked in my ways! 
 
14  I should soon have subdued their enemies, 
and turned my hand against their adversaries. 
15  The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto 
him: 
 
but their time should have endured for ever. 
16  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: 
 
and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

A Rebuke of Unjust Judgments 
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; 
 
he judgeth among the gods. 
2  How long will ye judge unjustly, 
and accept the persons of the wicked? 
 
Selah. 
3  Defend the poor and fatherless: 
 
do justice to the afflicted and needy. 
4  Deliver the poor and needy: 
 
rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 
5  They know not, neither will they understand; 
 
they walk on in darkness: 
 
all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
