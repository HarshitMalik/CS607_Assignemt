  1623    Jeremiah 6 
24  Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, 
that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he 
 
reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. 
25  Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have 
withholden good things from you. 
26  For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he 
 
that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. 
 
27  As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore 
 
they are become great, and waxen rich. 
28  They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the 
 
wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet 
 
they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. 
 
29  Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul 
   
be avenged on such a nation as this? 
 
30  Â¶ A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; 
 
31  the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their 
means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the 
   
end thereof? 
 
6 
The Doom of Jerusalem and Judah 
1  O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the 
midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a 
sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, 
 
and great destruction. 
2  I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate 
woman. 
3  The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall 
 
pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one 
 
in his place. 
4  Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe 
 
unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are 
 
stretched out.
