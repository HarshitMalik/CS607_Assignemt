What  is  seeing  essential  nature?  Following  nature  is
seeing  nature,  unconsciously  and  unknowingly  following
the laws of God.
CONSCIOUS DEVELOPMENT
The  words  conscious  development  go  together;  if  you
cannot  keep  presence  of  mind,  what  can  you  develop?
Keeping  conscious  presence  of  mind  is  nurturing  its
nature.  Before  arousal,  it  is  essential  to  nurture  it
consciously;  after  arousal,  it  is  essential  to  examine  it
introspectively.  Subjective  ideas  must  be  overcome,  and
when they have been overcome, conscious nurture is again
essential.  These  three  are  to  be  applied  successively,
without allowing any interruption.
Keeping presence of mind is not a matter of using effort
to keep hold of it. Simply be pure and have few desires—
this is keeping presence of mind.
We  must  realize  that  this  mind  comes  when  we  are
aware  and  goes  when  we  are  not  aware.  How  can  we
manage to be always aware, so that it does not go away? It
is  just  a  matter  of  thorough  familiarity,  that  is  all.  I  have
seen wild birds being kept; they are not domestic fowl, but
because they have been raised and familiarized, they will
not  leave  even  if  released.  Our  mind  is  here  in  our  own
heart—if we develop thorough familiarity with our mind,
why would there be any reason to lose it?
