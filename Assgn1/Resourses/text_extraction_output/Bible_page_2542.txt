  2543    2 Timothy 4 
Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the 
 
lion. 
18  And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will 
preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever 
 
and ever. Amen. 
Final Greetings 
19  ¶ Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.  
20  Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletus sick. 
 
21  Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and 
Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 
22  ¶ The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
