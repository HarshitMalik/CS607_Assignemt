  78    Genesis 32 
10  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, 
which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I 
 
passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
 
11  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the 
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and 
 
the mother with the children. 
12  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as 
the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 
13  ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which 
 
came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
 
14  two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes and 
twenty rams, 
15  thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, 
twenty she asses and ten foals. 
16  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by 
themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and 
 
put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
17  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother 
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and 
 
whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 
   
18  Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent 
 
unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 
 
19  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that 
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto 
Esau, when ye find him. 
20  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he 
said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and 
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 
 
21  So went the present over before him; and himself lodged that night 
 
in the company.
