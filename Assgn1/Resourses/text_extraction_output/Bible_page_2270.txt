  2271    John 9 
21  but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath 
 
opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak 
     
for himself. 
22  These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the 
 
Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was 
Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
23  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 
 
24  ¶ Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto 
him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
 
25  He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: 
 
one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
26  Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he 
 
thine eyes? 
 
27  He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: 
 
wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? 
   
28  Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are 
 
Moses’ disciples. 
29  We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know 
 
not from whence he is. 
30  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvelous 
thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened 
mine eyes. 
31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a 
 
worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
32  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the 
eyes of one that was born blind. 
33  If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
34  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in 
sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
 
Spiritual Blindness 
35  ¶ Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found 
 
him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
