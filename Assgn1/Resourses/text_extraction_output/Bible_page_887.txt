  888    2 Kings 21 
18  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, 
shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the 
 
king of Babylon.  
19  Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord 
which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and 
truth be in my days? 
 
The Death of Hezekiah 
20  ¶ And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how 
he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are 
they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of 
Judah? 
 
21  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned 
 
in his stead. 
21 
The Reign of Manasseh 
1  Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned 
fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Hephzibah. 
2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, after the 
abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out before the 
children of Israel. 
3  For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had 
destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did 
 
Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and 
 
served them. 
4  And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord 
said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.  
5  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the 
house of the Lord.
