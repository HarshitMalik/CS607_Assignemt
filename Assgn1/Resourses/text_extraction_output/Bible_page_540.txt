The Cities of the Levites 
1  Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar 
the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of 
the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
 
2  and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, 
The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to 
dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.  
3  And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their 
inheritance, at the commandment of the Lord, these cities and 
their suburbs. 
4  ¶ And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the 
 
children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot 
out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of 
the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. 
5  ¶ And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the 
families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and 
out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. 
6  ¶ And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the 
tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe 
of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, 
thirteen cities. 
7  ¶ The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of 
Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of 
Zebulun, twelve cities. 
8  ¶ And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities 
with their suburbs, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses. 
9  ¶ And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of 
the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here 
mentioned by name, 
10  which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the 
Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the 
 
first lot.
