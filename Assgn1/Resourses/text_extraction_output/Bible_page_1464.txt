  1465    Ecclesiastes 3 
wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also 
vanity. 
20  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor 
which I took under the sun. 
21  For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and 
in equity; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave 
 
it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
22  For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, 
wherein he hath labored under the sun? 
 
23  For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart 
 
taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. 
24  Â¶ There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and 
drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. 
This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. 
25  For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? 
 
26  For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and 
knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather 
 
and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. 
This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

A Time for Everything 
1  To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under 
the heaven: 
 
2  a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to 
 
pluck up that which is planted; 
 
3  a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time 
 
to build up; 
 
4  a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to 
 
dance; 
 
5  a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a 
 
time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
