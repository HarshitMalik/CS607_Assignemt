The Promise of the Lord’s Coming 
1  This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I 
 
stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
 
2  that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by 
the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of 
the Lord and Saviour: 
 
3  knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, 
walking after their own lusts,  
4  and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the 
 
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the 
beginning of the creation. 
5  For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the 
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in 
the water:  
 
6  whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, 
perished:  
 
7  but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word 
are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and 
perdition of ungodly men. 
8  ¶ But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is 
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  
9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count 
slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any 
 
should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
10  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the 
 
which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the 
elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works 
that are therein shall be burned up. 
11  ¶ Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of 
persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
