  2347    Acts 14 
Paul Stoned at Lystra 
8  ¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being 
a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked: 
 
9  the same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and 
 
perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
10  said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and 
walked. 
11  And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their 
voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down 
to us in the likeness of men. 
12  And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he 
 
was the chief speaker. 
13  Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought 
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice 
with the people. 
14  Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent 
their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, 
15  and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like 
 
passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from 
these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, 
and the sea, and all things that are therein: 
 
16  who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. 
17  Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did 
good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our 
hearts with food and gladness. 
18  And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they 
had not done sacrifice unto them. 
19  ¶ And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, 
who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out 
of the city, supposing he had been dead. 
20  Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and 
came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to 
 
Derbe.
