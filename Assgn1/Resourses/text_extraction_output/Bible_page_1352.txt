  1353    Psalms 110 
27  that they may know that this is thy hand; 
 
that thou, Lord, hast done it. 
28  Let them curse, but bless thou: 
 
when they arise, let them be ashamed; 
 
but let thy servant rejoice. 
29  Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; 
 
and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a 
mantle. 
30  I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; 
 
yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 
31  For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, 
to save him from those that condemn his soul.

The Lord Gives Dominion to the King 
A Psalm of David. 
1  The Lord said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou at my right hand, 
until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
2  The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: 
 
rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
3  Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, 
in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: 
 
thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
4  The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, 
Thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of Melchizedek.  
5  The Lord at thy right hand 
shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
6  He shall judge among the heathen, 
he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; 
 
he shall wound the heads over many countries.
