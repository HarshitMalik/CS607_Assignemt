  817    1 Kings 18 
32  and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and 
 
he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two 
measures of seed. 
33  And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and 
laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and 
pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

a sound of abundance of rain.
