  1524    Isaiah 19 
6  And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defense 
 
shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither. 
 
7  The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and 
every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and 
be no more. 
8  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the 
brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters 
shall languish. 
9  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave 
networks, shall be confounded. 
10  And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make 
sluices and ponds for fish. 
11  ¶ Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise 
counselors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, 
 
I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
 
12  Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee 
   
now, and let them know what the Lord of hosts hath purposed 
upon Egypt. 
13  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are 
deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of 
 
the tribes thereof. 
14  The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and 
 
they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken 
man staggereth in his vomit. 
15  Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, 
branch or rush, may do. 
16  ¶ In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid 
 
and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts, 
which he shaketh over it. 
17  And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that 
maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the 
counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath determined against it. 
18  ¶ In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language 
of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called, The 
 
city of destruction.
