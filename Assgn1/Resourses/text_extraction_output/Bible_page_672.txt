  673    1 Samuel 22 
13  And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou 
and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a 
sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against 
me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
 
14  Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so 
faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son-in-
law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thine house? 
 
15  Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let 
   
not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house 
of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. 
 
16  And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all 
thy father’s house. 
17  And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, 
and slay the priests of the Lord; because their hand also is with 
 
David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to 
me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to 
fall upon the priests of the Lord. 
18  And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. 
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and 
slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen 
ephod. 
19  And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the 
sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, 
and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
20  ¶ And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named 
Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
21  And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the Lord’s priests. 
22  And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the 
Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned 
 
the death of all the persons of thy father’s house. 
23  Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh 
 
thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
