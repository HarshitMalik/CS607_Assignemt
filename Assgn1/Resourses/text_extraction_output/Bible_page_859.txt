  860    2 Kings 11 
28  ¶ Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 
29  Howbeit, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made 
Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden 
calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.  
30  And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in 
executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the 
house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children 
of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. 
31  But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel 
with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, 
 
which made Israel to sin. 
32  ¶ In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short: and Hazael 
 
smote them in all the coasts of Israel; 
 
33  from Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the 
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river 
Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 
34  Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his 
might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the 
kings of Israel? 
 
35  And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. 
 
And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
36  And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty 
and eight years.

Athaliah Usurps the Throne 
1  And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was 
dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 
2  But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took 
Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons 
which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the 
 
bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
