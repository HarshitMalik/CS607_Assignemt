  315    Numbers 5 
46  ¶ All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and 
Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and 
after the house of their fathers, 
47  from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every 
one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of 
the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation, 
48  even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and 
five hundred and fourscore. 
49  According to the commandment of the Lord they were numbered 
by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and 
according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the 
 
Lord commanded Moses.

The Unclean Driven from the Camp 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp 
every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is 
defiled by the dead: 
 
3  both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye 
put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I 
 
dwell. 
4  And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the 
camp: as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
 
The Law of Recompense 
5  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
6  Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall 
commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the 
Lord, and that person be guilty; 
 
7  then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall 
 
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it
