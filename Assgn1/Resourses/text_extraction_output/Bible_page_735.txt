  736    2 Samuel 18

The Death of Absalom 
1  And David numbered the people that were with him, and set 
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
2  And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of 
Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, 
Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. 
And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you 
myself also. 
3  But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee 
 
away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they 
 
care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore 
   
now it is better that thou succor us out of the city. 
4  And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And 
the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by 
hundreds and by thousands. 
5  And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal 
gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all 
the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge 
concerning Absalom. 
6  ¶ So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle 
 
was in the wood of Ephraim; 
 
7  where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, 
and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand 
men. 
8  For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: 
 
and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword 
devoured. 
9  ¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon 
a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, 
and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between 
the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went 
 
away.
