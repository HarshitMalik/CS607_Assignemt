  2040    Matthew 12 
12 
The Disciples Pluck Grain on the Sabbath 
1  At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and 
 
his disciples were ahungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn, 
and to eat. 
2  But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy 
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. 
3  But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he 
was ahungered, and they that were with him; 
 
4  how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread, 
which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were 
with him, but only for the priests? 
 
5  Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the 
priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? 
 
6  But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. 
7  But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not 
sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. 
8  For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. 
The Man with a Withered Hand 
9  Â¶ And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: 
 
10  and, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And 
they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? 
 
that they might accuse him. 
11  And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that 
shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will 
he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  
 
12  How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is 
 
lawful to do well on the sabbath days. 
13  Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he 
stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
