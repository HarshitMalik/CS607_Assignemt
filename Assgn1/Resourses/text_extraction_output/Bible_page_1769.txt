  1770    Ezekiel 10 
11  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not 
 
as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they 
followed it; they turned not as they went. 
 
12  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their 
wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the 
wheels that they four had. 
13  As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.  
14  And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, 
 
and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a 
lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.  
15  ¶ And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I 
saw by the river of Chebar. 
16  And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when 
 
the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the 
same wheels also turned not from beside them. 
17  When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these 
 
lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in 
 
them. 
18  ¶ Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of 
the house, and stood over the cherubim. 
19  And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the 
earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside 
 
them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord’s 
house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
 
20  ¶ This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the 
river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim. 
 
21  Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the 
 
likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
22  And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the 
river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every 
 
one straight forward.
