  1765    Ezekiel 8 
19  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be 
removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver 
 
them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfy 
 
their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the 
 
stumblingblock of their iniquity. 
20  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they 
 
made the images of their abominations and of their detestable 
things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. 
 
21  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to 
the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. 
 
22  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret 
place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. 
 
23  ¶ Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is 
 
full of violence. 
24  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall 
possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to 
 
cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. 
 
25  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be 
 
none. 
26  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon 
rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law 
   
shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
27  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with 
desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be 
troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their 
 
deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

The Prophet’s Vision of the Abominations in Jerusalem 
1  And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth 
day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat 
before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.
