  442    Deuteronomy 14 
13  Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, 
and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go 
and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 
 
14  then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, 
 
behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is 
wrought among you; 
 
15  thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of 
the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the 
cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 
16  And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street 
thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof 
every whit, for the Lord thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it 
   
shall not be built again. 
17  And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: 
 
that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show 
thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as 
he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 
 
18  when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep 
all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that 
which is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God. 
14 
1  Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not cut 
 
yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.  
2  For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord 
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the 
nations that are upon the earth. 
Clean and Unclean Food 
3  Â¶ Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
4  These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the 
 
goat,
