  2273    John 10 
8  All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep 
 
did not hear them. 
9  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and 
 
shall go in and out, and find pasture. 
10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I 
 
am come that they might have life, and that they might have it 
more abundantly. 
11  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the 
 
sheep. 
12  But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the 
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and 
fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 
 
13  The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the 
sheep. 
14  I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of 
mine. 
15  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay 
 
down my life for the sheep. 
16  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must 
 
bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and 
 
one shepherd. 
17  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that 
I might take it again. 
18  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have 
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This 
commandment have I received of my Father. 
19  Â¶ There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these 
sayings. 
20  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye 
 
him? 
 
21  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a 
devil open the eyes of the blind?
