  240    Leviticus 7 
30  And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the 
tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, 
shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire. 
 
7 
1  Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy. 
 
2  In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the 
trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round 
 
about upon the altar. 
3  And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that 
 
covereth the inwards, 
4  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the 
flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall 
he take away: 
 
5  and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made 
by fire unto the Lord: it is a trespass offering. 
 
6  Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in 
 
the holy place: it is most holy. 
 
7  As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for 
 
them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it. 
 
8  And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the 
priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he 
hath offered. 
9  And all the meat offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is 
dressed in the frying pan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that 
offereth it. 
10  And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the 
sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. 
11  ¶ And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he 
shall offer unto the Lord. 
12  If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the 
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and 
unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, 
of fine flour, fried.
