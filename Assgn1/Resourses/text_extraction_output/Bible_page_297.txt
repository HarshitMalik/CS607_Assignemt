  298    Leviticus 27 
16  ¶ And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of 
his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed 
thereof: a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of 
 
silver. 
17  If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy 
estimation it shall stand. 
18  But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall 
reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, 
even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy 
estimation. 
19  And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then 
he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, 
and it shall be assured to him. 
20  And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to 
another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 
21  But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto 
the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the 
 
priest’s. 
22  And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, 
which is not of the fields of his possession; 
 
23  then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, 
even unto the year of the jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation 
 
in that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord. 
24  In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it 
was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did 
belong. 
25  And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the 
sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 
 
26  ¶ Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord’s 
firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the 
   
Lord’s. 
27  And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to 
thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be 
 
not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
