  278    Leviticus 21 
23  And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast 
out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I 
 
abhorred them. 
24  But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give 
it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I 
 
am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other 
people. 
25  Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, 
and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your 
 
souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living 
thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from 
you as unclean. 
26  And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have 
 
severed you from other people, that ye should be mine. 
27  Â¶ A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a 
wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with 
 
stones; their blood shall be upon them. 
 
21 
The Holiness of the Priests 
1  And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of 
Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead 
among his people: 
 
2  but for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for 
his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, 
3  and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no 
husband; for her may he be defiled. 
 
4  But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, 
to profane himself. 
5  They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they 
shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their 
flesh.
