  2206    Luke 14 
thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again, 
 
and a recompense be made thee. 
13  But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, 
the blind: 
 
14  and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for 
   
thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. 
The Parable of the Great Supper 
15  Â¶ And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these 
things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the 
kingdom of God. 
16  Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and 
bade many: 
 
17  and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, 
Come; for all things are now ready. 
 
18  And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said 
unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and 
see it: I pray thee have me excused. 
 
19  And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to 
prove them: I pray thee have me excused. 
 
20  And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot 
come. 
21  So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the 
master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly 
into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, 
and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. 
22  And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and 
yet there is room. 
23  And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and 
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. 
24  For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden 
shall taste of my supper.
