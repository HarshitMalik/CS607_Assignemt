  2272    John 10 
36  He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on 
him? 
 
37  And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that 
talketh with thee. 
38  And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
39  And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they 
which see not might see; and that they which see might be made 
 
blind. 
40  And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, 
and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
 
41  Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but 
 
now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

The Parable of the Sheepfold 
1  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into 
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief 
and a robber. 
2  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
3  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he 
   
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
4  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, 
and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 
 
5  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they 
 
know not the voice of strangers. 
6  This parable spake Jesus unto them; but they understood not what 
 
things they were which he spake unto them. 
Jesus the Good Shepherd 
7  Â¶ Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I 
am the door of the sheep.
