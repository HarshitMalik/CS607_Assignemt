  1180    Job 31 
28  this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: 
 
for I should have denied the God that is above. 
29  If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, 
or lifted up myself when evil found him; 
 
30  (neither have I suffered my mouth to sin 
by wishing a curse to his soul.) 
31  If the men of my tabernacle said not, 
Oh that we had of his flesh! We cannot be satisfied. 
 
32  The stranger did not lodge in the street: 
 
but I opened my doors to the traveler. 
33  If I covered my transgressions as Adam, 
by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 
 
34  did I fear a great multitude, 
or did the contempt of families terrify me, 
that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 
 
35  Oh that one would hear me! 
 
Behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, 
and that mine adversary had written a book. 
36  Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, 
and bind it as a crown to me. 
37  I would declare unto him the number of my steps; 
 
as a prince would I go near unto him. 
38  If my land cry against me, 
or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 
 
39  if I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, 
or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
 
40  let thistles grow instead of wheat, 
and cockle instead of barley. 
The words of Job are ended.
