The Leaders Plot against Jesus 
1  After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened 
bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might 
 
take him by craft, and put him to death. 
2  But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the 
people. 
Jesus Anointed at Bethany 
3  Â¶ And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat 
at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment 
of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on 
 
his head.  
4  And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and 
said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 
 
5  For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, 
and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
6  And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath 
   
wrought a good work on me. 
7  For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye 
may do them good: but me ye have not always. 
 
8  She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my 
 
body to the burying. 
9  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached 
throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be 
spoken of for a memorial of her.
