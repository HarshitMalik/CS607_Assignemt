BHAGAVAD GITA
10. Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by
the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.
Ye yathaa maam prapadyante taamstathaiva bhajaamyaham;
Mama vartmaanuvartante manushyaah paartha sarvashah.
11. In whatever way men approach Me, even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in
all ways, O Arjuna!
Kaangkshantah karmanaam siddhim yajanta iha devataah;
Kshipram hi maanushe loke siddhir bhavati karmajaa.
12. Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods, because success
is quickly attained by men through action.
Chaaturvarnyam mayaa srishtam gunakarma vibhaagashah;
Tasya kartaaram api maam viddhyakartaaram avyayam.
13. The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and
Karma; though I am the author thereof, know Me as the non-doer and immutable.
COMMENTARY: The four castes are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. This
division is according to the Guna and Karma. Guna is quality. Karma is the kind of work. Both
Guna and Karma determine the caste of a man.
In a Brahmana, Sattwa predominates. He possesses serenity, purity, self-restraint,
straightforwardness and devotion.
In a Kshatriya, Rajas predominates. He possesses prowess, splendour, firmness, dexterity,
generosity and rulership.
In a Vaisya, Rajas predominates and Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. He does the duty of
ploughing, protection of cattle and trade.
In a Sudra, Tamas predominates and Rajas is subordinate to the quality of Tamas. He
renders service to the other three castes. Human temperaments and tendencies vary according to the
Gunas.
Na maam karmaani limpanti na me karmaphale sprihaa;
Iti maam yoâ€™bhijaanaati karmabhir na sa badhyate.
14. Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruits of actions. He who knows Me
thus is not bound by actions.
Evam jnaatwaa kritam karma poorvair api mumukshubhih;
Kuru karmaiva tasmaat twam poorvaih poorvataram kritam.
