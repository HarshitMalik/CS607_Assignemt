  586    Judges 12 
34  Â¶ And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his 
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and 
 
she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
 
35  And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and 
said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou 
 
art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto 
 
the Lord, and I cannot go back.  
36  And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth 
unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded 
out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for 
 
thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. 
37  And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me 
 
alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the 
mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. 
38  And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she 
 
went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the 
mountains. 
39  And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned 
unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he 
had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 
 
40  that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of 
Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. 
12 
1  And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went 
northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over 
to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go 
with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 
 
2  And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife 
with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered 
 
me not out of their hands. 
3  And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, 
and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord
