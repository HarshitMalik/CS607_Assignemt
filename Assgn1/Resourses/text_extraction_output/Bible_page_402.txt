  403    Numbers 35 
24  then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the 
revenger of blood according to these judgments: 
 
25  and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the 
revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the 
city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto 
 
the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
26  But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the 
city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 
 
27  and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city 
of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not 
 
be guilty of blood: 
 
28  because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the 
death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the 
 
slayer shall return into the land of his possession. 
The Law concerning Bloodshed 
29  Â¶ So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you 
throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
30  Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by 
the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against 
 
any person to cause him to die.  
31  Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, 
which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death. 
 
32  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of 
his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the 
death of the priest. 
33  So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth 
 
the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed 
 
therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 
34  Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I 
dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.
