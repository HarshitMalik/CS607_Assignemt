  2479    Galatians 2 
2  And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that 
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them 
which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had 
run, in vain. 
3  But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled 
to be circumcised: 
 
4  and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came 
in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that 
they might bring us into bondage: 
 
5  to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the 
 
truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
6  But of those who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, 
it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for 
   
they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to 
me: 
 
7  but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the 
uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the 
circumcision was unto Peter; 
 
8  (for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the 
circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles;) 
 
9  and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, 
perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and 
Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the 
 
heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 
10  Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same 
 
which I also was forward to do. 
Paul Rebukes Peter at Antioch 
11  ¶ But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, 
because he was to be blamed. 
12  For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the 
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated 
 
himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
