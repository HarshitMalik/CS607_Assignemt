  805    1 Kings 14 
20  And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: 
 
and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his 
stead. 
The Reign of Rehoboam 
21  ¶ And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam 
was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 
seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose 
out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his 
mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. 
22  And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked 
him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above 
all that their fathers had done. 
23  For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on 
every high hill, and under every green tree.  
24  And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according 
 
to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out 
before the children of Israel. 
25  ¶ And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that 
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:  
 
26  and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the 
treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took 
   
away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.  
27  And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and 
committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which 
kept the door of the king’s house. 
28  And it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord, that 
the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard 
chamber. 
29  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are 
they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of 
Judah? 
 
30  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
