  1598    Isaiah 60 
like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against 
him. 
20  ¶ And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn 
from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. 
21  As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; My 
 
Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy 
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of 
thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the Lord, 
from henceforth and for ever. 
60 
The Future Glory of Zion 
1  Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is 
 
risen upon thee. 
2  For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness 
the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall 
 
be seen upon thee. 
3  And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the 
brightness of thy rising. 
4  ¶ Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather 
 
themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from 
 
far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. 
5  Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, 
and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be 
 
converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto 
thee. 
6  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of 
Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring 
   
gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the 
 
Lord. 
7  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the 
rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with 
 
acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
