  1289    Psalms 69 
69 
A Cry of Distress 
To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Save me, O God; 
 
for the waters are come in unto my soul. 
2  I sink in deep mire, 
where there is no standing: 
 
I am come into deep waters, 
where the floods overflow me. 
3  I am weary of my crying: 
 
my throat is dried: 
 
mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
4  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine 
head: 
 
they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are 
mighty: 
 
then I restored that which I took not away. 
5  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; 
 
and my sins are not hid from thee. 
6  Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed 
for my sake: 
 
let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of 
Israel. 
7  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; 
 
shame hath covered my face. 
8  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, 
and an alien unto my motherâ€™s children. 
9  For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;  
 
and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon 
me.  
10  When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting,
