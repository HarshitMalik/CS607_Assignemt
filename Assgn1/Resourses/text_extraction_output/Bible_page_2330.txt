  2331    Acts 9 
10  ¶ And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; 
 
and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, 
I am here, Lord. 
11  And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is 
called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, 
of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, 
 
12  and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and 
putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. 
13  Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, 
how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
 
14  and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that 
call on thy name. 
15  But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel 
 
unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the 
children of Israel: 
 
16  for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s 
sake. 
17  And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting 
 
his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that 
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that 
thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. 
18  And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and 
 
he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. 
19  And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. 
Saul Preaches at Damascus 
¶ Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at 
Damascus. 
20  And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is 
the Son of God. 
21  But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that 
 
destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came 
hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the 
chief priests?
