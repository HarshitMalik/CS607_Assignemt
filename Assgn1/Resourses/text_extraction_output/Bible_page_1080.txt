come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more 
a reproach. 
18  Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; 
 
as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, 
Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this 
good work. 
19  But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the 
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to 
scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will 
 
ye rebel against the king? 
 
20  Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he 
will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but 
   
ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

The Sections Assigned for Repair 
1  Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, 
and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the 
 
doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the 
 
tower of Hananeel. 
2  And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them 
builded Zaccur the son of Imri. 
3  ¶ But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid 
the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, 
and the bars thereof. 
4  And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son 
of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of 
Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired 
Zadok the son of Baana. 
5  And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not 
 
their necks to the work of their Lord.
