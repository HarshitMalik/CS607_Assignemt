1  Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
2  And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, 
and they put on him a purple robe, 
3  and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their 
 
hands. 
4  Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I 
bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in 
him. 
5  Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the 
purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! 
 
6  When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried 
out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take 
ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. 
 
7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to 
die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
8  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; 
 
9  and went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, 
Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
 
10  Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest 
 
thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to 
release thee? 
 
11  Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, 
except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered 
 
me unto thee hath the greater sin. 
12  ¶ And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews 
 
cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s 
friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 
 
13  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, 
and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the 
Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.~~~ 
14  And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth 
hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
