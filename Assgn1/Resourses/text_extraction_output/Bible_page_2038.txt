  2039    Matthew 11 
19  The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a 
man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and 
sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. 
Woes to Unrepentant Cities 
20  ¶ Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty 
works were done, because they repented not: 
 
21  Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the 
   
mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and 
Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
22  But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at 
the day of judgment, than for you. 
23  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be 
brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been 
 
done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained 
until this day. 
24  But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of 
Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. 
Come unto Me and Rest 
25  ¶ At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord 
of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the 
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. 
26  Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
 
27  All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man 
 
knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the 
 
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. 
28  Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest. 
29  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly 
 
in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  
 
30  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
