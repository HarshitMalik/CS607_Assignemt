  662    1 Samuel 18 
18 
Jonathan’s Covenant with David 
1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto 
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and 
Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
2  And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to 
his father’s house. 
3  Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him 
as his own soul. 
4  And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and 
gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his 
bow, and to his girdle. 
5  And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved 
himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was 
 
accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s 
servants. 
Saul Becomes Jealous of David 
6  ¶ And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from 
the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities 
of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with 
joy, and with instruments of music. 
7  And the women answered one another as they played, and said, 
Saul hath slain his thousands, 
and David his ten thousands.  
8  And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he 
 
said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they 
have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the 
 
kingdom? 
 
9  And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
10  ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God 
came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and
