the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest 
 
are the seven churches.

The Message to Ephesus 
1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith 
 
he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in 
the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. 
2  ¶ I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou 
canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which 
 
say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 
 
3  and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast 
labored, and hast not fainted. 
4  Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left 
thy first love. 
5  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and 
do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will 
 
remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 
6  But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, 
which I also hate. 
7  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of 
 
life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. 
The Message to Smyrna 
8  ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things 
 
saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive. 
9  ¶ I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art 
rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, 
and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. 
10  Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil 
 
shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall
