  2212    Luke 17 
20  and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his 
gate, full of sores, 
21  and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich 
man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
 
22  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the 
angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was 
 
buried; 
 
23  and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth 
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
24  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and 
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and 
cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
 
25  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime 
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but 
 
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 
26  And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so 
 
that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can 
 
they pass to us, that would come from thence. 
27  Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send 
him to my father’s house: 
 
28  for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they 
 
also come into this place of torment. 
29  Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let 
 
them hear them. 
30  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from 
 
the dead, they will repent. 
31  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, 
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

Causing to Sin 
1  Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses 
will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!
