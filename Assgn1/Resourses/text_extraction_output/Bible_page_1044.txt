  1045    2 Chronicles 34 
Josiah’s Reforms 
3  ¶ For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he 
began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth 
 
year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, 
and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 
4  And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the 
 
images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, 
 
and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, 
and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that 
had sacrificed unto them. 
5  And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and 
cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 
6  And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, 
even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about. 
7  And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had 
beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols 
throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. 
The Book of the Law Discovered 
8  ¶ Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the 
land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and 
Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the 
recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God. 
9  And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the 
money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites 
that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and 
Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and 
Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. 
 
10  And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight 
of the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen that 
wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and amend the house:
