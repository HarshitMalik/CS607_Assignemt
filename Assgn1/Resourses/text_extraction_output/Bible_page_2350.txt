  2351    Acts 15 
30  ¶ So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when 
 
they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the 
epistle: 
 
31  which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
32  And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the 
brethren with many words, and confirmed them. 
33  And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace 
from the brethren unto the apostles. 
34  Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. 
35  Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and 
preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

Journey 
36  ¶ And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and 
visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of 
the Lord, and see how they do. 
37  And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname 
was Mark. 
38  But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed 
from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
39  And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed 
asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed 
 
unto Cyprus; 
 
40  and Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the 
brethren unto the grace of God. 
41  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
