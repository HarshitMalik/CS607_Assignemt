When  there  is  jade  in  a  mountain,  the  plants  and  trees
there  do  not  wither;  when  people  embrace  the  Way,  their
physical bodies are stabilized by that. When imbued with
its  influence  for  a  long  time,  the  physical  constitution  is
assimilated to the spirit. When you refine the body to gain
access  to  subtleties,  merging  with  the  Way,  then  you
disperse  one  body  into  myriad  things  and  merge  myriad
things into one body.
The  illumination  of  wisdom  is  boundless,  physical
transcendence is endless. You employ the totality of matter
and emptiness, set aside Creation to accomplish the work.
Genuine  response  without  bias—that  is  the  virtue  of  the
Way. The Scripture on the Western Ascent says, “Have the
same  mind  as  heaven  but  without  knowing  it;  have  the
same body as the Way but without distinguishing it. After
that  the  Way  of  Heaven  is  fulfilled.”  This  refers  to
attainment of realization of its consummation.
When the spirit does not leave the body, it lasts as long
as the Way. When the body is assimilated to the Way, then
it  never  ceases  to  exist.  When  the  mind  is  assimilated  to
the Way, there is nothing it does not penetrate. When the
ears are assimilated to the Way, there is no sound they do
not hear. When the eyes are assimilated to the Way, there
is no form they do not see.
Clarity  and  effectiveness  of  the  six  senses  come  from
this, but mediocrities of recent times whose consciousness
does  not  reach  far  have  only  heard  of  the  path  of
relinquishment  of  the  body  and  have  not  realized  the
