his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half 
dead. 
31  And by chance there came down a certain priest that way; and 
 
when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
32  And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked 
on him, and passed by on the other side. 
33  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and 
 
when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 
34  and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and 
wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, 
and took care of him. 
35  And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and 
gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him: and 
 
whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay 
thee. 
36  Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him 
that fell among the thieves? 
 
37  And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto 
him, Go, and do thou likewise. 
Jesus Visits Martha and Mary 
38  ¶ Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain 
village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her 
 
house. 
39  And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and 
heard his word. 
40  But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, 
and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to 
serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 
 
41  And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art 
careful and troubled about many things: 
 
42  but one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, 
 
which shall not be taken away from her.
