objects  are  spontaneously  gone.  When  you  thoroughly
examine  stirring  thoughts,  thoughts  too  are  empty  and
silent. So we know there is nothing lost when deluded and
nothing  gained  when  enlightened,  because  the  true  mind
not dwelling on anything neither increases nor decreases.
Mind  is  around  because  of  objects,  objects  are  viewed
by  means  of  mind.  If  you  arouse  the  mind  on  seeing
objects,  even  if  you  live  in  a  mountain  forest  or  on  an

Good  objects  and  bad  objects  are  both  objects;  even  if
they  come  in  droves,  they  are  not  existent.  Perverse
thoughts and upright thoughts both are in the category of
arbitrary  thoughts;  even  though  they  occur  in  confusion,
they still do not exist.
Do not say sensual desires are pleasant; if you get lost
and forget to return, you will inevitably come to the point
of damaging your body and your life.
You  should  know  that  one  essential  nature  is  real  and
embrace  it  without  parting.  Then  you  can  seek  wisdom
and  thus  aspire  to  sagehood.  When  you  make
bedevilments vanish and break through existence, then the
impure  world  is  transformed  into  a  pure  land.  When  you
