  2063    Matthew 19 
10  ¶ His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his 
wife, it is not good to marry. 
11  But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they 
to whom it is given. 
12  For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their 
mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made 
 
eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made 
 
themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is 
able to receive it, let him receive it. 
Jesus Blesses Little Children 
13  ¶ Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should 
put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 
 
14  But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come 
unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 
 
15  And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. 
The Rich Young Ruler 
16  ¶ And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what 
good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 
 
17  And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none 
 
good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the 
 
commandments. 
18  He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, 
 
Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt 
not bear false witness,  
19  Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy 
 
neighbor as thyself.  
20  The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from 
my youth up: what lack I yet? 
   
21  Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou 
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: 
 
and come and follow me.
