  2118    Mark 8 
30  And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone 
out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. 
Jesus Heals a Deaf and Dumb Man 
31  Â¶ And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came 
unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of 
Decapolis. 
32  And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an 
impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand 
 
upon him. 
33  And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into 
his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 
 
34  and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, 
Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
35  And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue 
was loosed, and he spake plain. 
36  And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he 
 
charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; 
 
37  and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all 
things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to 
 
speak.

The Feeding of the Four Thousand 
1  In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to 
eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 
2  I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been 
with me three days, and have nothing to eat: 
 
3  and if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint 
by the way: for divers of them came from far. 
 
4  And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy 
these men with bread here in the wilderness?
