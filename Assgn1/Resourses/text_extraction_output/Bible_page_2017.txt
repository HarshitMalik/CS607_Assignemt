Jesus Calls Four Fishermen 
18  ¶ And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon 
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for

19  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of 
men. 
20  And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 
21  And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the 
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their 
father, mending their nets; and he called them. 
 
22  And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed 
him. 
Jesus Ministers to a Great Multitude 
23  ¶ And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, 
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner 
of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  
24  And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto 
 
him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and 
torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those 
which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed 
 
them. 
25  And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, 
and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from 
beyond Jordan.
