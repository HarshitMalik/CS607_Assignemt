Ruth Gleans in the Field of Boaz 
1  And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of 
wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. 
 
2  And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the 
field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find 
grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
3  And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: 
 
and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, 
who was of the kindred of Elimelech. 
4  And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the 
reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The 
Lord bless thee. 
5  Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, 
Whose damsel is this? 
 
6  And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It 
is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the 
country of Moab: 
 
7  and she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers 
among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the 
 
morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. 
8  ¶ Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go 
 
not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here 
fast by my maidens: 
 
9  let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after 
them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch 
 
thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of 
 
that which the young men have drawn. 
10  Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said 
unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou 
shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? 
 
11  And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed 
me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death
