29 
The Consecration of Aaron and His Sons 
1  And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, 
to minister unto me in the priest’s office: Take one young bullock, 
 
and two rams without blemish, 
2  and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, 
and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt 
 
thou make them. 
3  And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the 
basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 
4  And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 
5  And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, 
and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and 
gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 
 
6  and thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown 
upon the mitre. 
7  Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, 
and anoint him. 
8  And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 
9  And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put 
the bonnets on them: and the priest’s office shall be theirs for a 
 
perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 
 
10  ¶ And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the 
tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron and his sons shall put 
 
their hands upon the head of the bullock. 
11  And thou shalt kill the bullock before the Lord, by the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation. 
12  And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the 
horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the 
bottom of the altar.
