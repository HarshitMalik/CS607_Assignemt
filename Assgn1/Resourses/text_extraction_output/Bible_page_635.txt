  636    1 Samuel 9 
19  ¶ Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and 
 
they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
   
20  that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may 
 
judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
21  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed 
them in the ears of the Lord. 
22  And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make 
them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every 
man unto his city.

Saul Chosen King 
1  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son 
of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, 
a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 
2  And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a 
goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier 
 
person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than 
 
any of the people. 
3  ¶ And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul 
his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek 
the asses. 
4  And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the 
land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed 
 
through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed 
 
through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. 
5  ¶ And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his 
servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father 
 
leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. 
6  And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of 
God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to 
 
pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way 
   
that we should go.
