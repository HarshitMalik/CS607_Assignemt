Faith  is  the  root  of  the  Way,  seriousness  is  the  stem  of
virtue. When the root is deep, the Way can develop; when
the stem is firm, virtue can flourish.
A  man  who  presented  a  gem  to  a  king  got  his  feet  cut
off in punishment because the king could not recognize the
value of the jewel in the matrix; a man who spoke out to
save a nation was executed for it.
The  implication  is  that  when  matter  and  means  attract
attention,  the  mind  gets  confused;  when  principles  and
phenomena appear, thinking gets dizzy.
Now  seeing  as  how  the  ultimate  Way  transcends  form
and flavor, and true essence is apart from objects of desire,
how  then  could  one  hear  of  the  rarefied  and  subtle  and
believe in it, or hear of the imageless and not be confused?
When  people  hear  tell  of  sitting  forgetting,  if  they
believe  this  is  essential  to  practicing  the  Way,  respect  it
and  have  no  doubt,  and  also  put  it  into  practice,  they  are
sure to attain the Way.
Therefore  Chuang-tzu  said,  “Mortifying  the  body,
dismissing  intelligence,  detaching  from  form,  departing
from knowledge, assimilating to the great pervasion—this
is called sitting forgetting.”
When sitting forgetting, what is not forgotten? Inwardly
you do not notice your own body; outwardly you are not
aware  of  the  universe.  As  you  mystically  unite  with  the
Way, myriad cogitations all disappear.
When  Chuang-tzu  speaks  of  “the  great  pervasion,”  the
words  are  shallow  but  the  meaning  is  deep.  Confused
