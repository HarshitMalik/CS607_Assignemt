Daniel’s Vision by the Great River 
1  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto 
Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was 
 
true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the 
 
thing, and had understanding of the vision. 
2  ¶ In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. 
3  I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, 
neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were 
fulfilled. 
4  And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by 
the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel; 
 
5  then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man 
clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 
 
6  his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of 
lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet 
like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the 
voice of a multitude. 
7  And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me 
 
saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they 
 
fled to hide themselves. 
8  Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there 
remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me 
 
into corruption, and I retained no strength. 
9  Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his 
 
words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward 
the ground. 
10  ¶ And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees 
and upon the palms of my hands. 
11  And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand 
the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee 
 
am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I 
stood trembling.
