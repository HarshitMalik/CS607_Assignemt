  2072    Matthew 22 
8  Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which 
were bidden were not worthy. 
9  Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid 
to the marriage. 
10  So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered 
together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the 
 
wedding was furnished with guests. 
11  ¶ And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man 
which had not on a wedding garment: 
 
12  and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not 
having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. 
 
13  Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and 
take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be 
 
weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
14  For many are called, but few are chosen. 
Paying Taxes to Caesar 
15  ¶ Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might 
entangle him in his talk. 
16  And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, 
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of 
God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest 
 
not the person of men. 
17  Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute 
 
unto Caesar, or not? 
 
18  But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, 
ye hypocrites? 
 
19  Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
20  And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
 
21  They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render 
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God 
 
the things that are God’s. 
22  When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and 
went their way.
