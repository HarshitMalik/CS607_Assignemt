  2565    Hebrews 10 
6  in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. 
7  Then said I, Lo, I come 
(in the volume of the book it is written of me) 
to do thy will, O God.  
8  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and 
offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; 
 
which are offered by the law; 
 
9  then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the 
first, that he may establish the second. 
10  By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body 
of Jesus Christ once for all. 
11  ¶ And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering 
oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  
 
12  but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat 
down on the right hand of God; 
 
13  from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  
14  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are 
sanctified. 
15  Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had 
 
said before, 
16  This is the covenant that I will make with them 
after those days, saith the Lord; 
 
I will put my laws into their hearts, 
and in their minds will I write them;  
 
17  and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  
18  Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. 
Let Us Draw Near and Hold Fast 
19  ¶ Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by 
the blood of Jesus, 
20  by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through 
the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
 
21  and having a high priest over the house of God;
