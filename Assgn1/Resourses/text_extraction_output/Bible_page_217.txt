  218    Exodus 38 
26  And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides 
thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a 
 
crown of gold round about. 
27  And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by 
the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for 
the staves to bear it withal. 
28  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with 
gold. 
29  ¶ And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of 
sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.  
38 
1  And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits 
 
was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was 
 
foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. 
 
2  And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns 
 
thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 
 
3  And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, 
and the basins, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels 
 
thereof made he of brass. 
4  And he made for the altar a brazen grate of network, under the 
compass thereof, beneath unto the midst of it. 
5  And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be 
places for the staves. 
6  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with 
brass. 
7  And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear 
it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards. 
 
8  ¶ And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the 
looking glasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
