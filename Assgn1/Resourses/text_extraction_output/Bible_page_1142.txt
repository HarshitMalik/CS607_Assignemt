9 
Jobâ€™s Inability to Answer God 
1  Then Job answered and said, 
2  I know it is so of a truth: 
 
but how should man be just with God? 
 
3  If he will contend with him, 
he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
4  He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: 
 
who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 
 
5  which removeth the mountains, and they know not; 
 
which overturneth them in his anger; 
 
6  which shaketh the earth out of her place, 
and the pillars thereof tremble; 
 
7  which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; 
 
and sealeth up the stars; 
 
8  which alone spreadeth out the heavens, 
and treadeth upon the waves of the sea; 
 
9  which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades,  
and the chambers of the south; 
 
10  which doeth great things past finding out; 
 
yea, and wonders without number. 
11  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: 
 
he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 
12  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? 
 
Who will say unto him, What doest thou? 
 
13  If God will not withdraw his anger, 
the proud helpers do stoop under him. 
14  How much less shall I answer him, 
and choose out my words to reason with him? 
 
15  whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, 
but I would make supplication to my judge. 
16  If I had called, and he had answered me; 
 
yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
