  1124    Esther 8 
9  And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, 
Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made 
for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the 
house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. 
10  So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for 
Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.

The Jews Authorized to Resist 
1  On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the 
Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the 
king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. 
 
2  And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, 
and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house 
of Haman. 
3  ¶ And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his 
feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of 
Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the 
Jews. 
4  Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther 
arose, and stood before the king, 
5  and said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, 
and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his 
eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the 
son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the 
Jews which are in all the king’s provinces: 
 
6  for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my 
people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? 
   
7  Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to 
Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, 
and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his 
hand upon the Jews.
