I  am  going  to  reverse  the  order  and  talk  about  lower
alchemy. You cannot rush; you will be finished only when
you  have  attained  thorough  resolution,  so  that  your  vital
spirit  is  clear  and  fresh.  Otherwise  you  will  merely  have
one  or  two  experiences,  or  the  process  will  break  down
after starting.
If you are careless with lower alchemy, it is very easy to
cause  harm.  I  see  so  many  people  trying  to  practice
without  doing  it  correctly  from  the  start.  Before  their
minds are settled, and before they have perceived the right
conditions,  they  immediately  cross  their  legs,  fold  their
hands,  and  deliberately  sit.  Their  heads  are  not  right  to
start  with;  their  bodies  are  not  upright,  their  gaze  is  not
even.  They  try  to  operate  the  process  before  the  fire  is
even  burning  in  the  furnace.  Even  though  there  remain  a
number of conditions that have to be present, they cannot
waitâ€”they  shut  their  eyes  tight,  so  that  purity  and
pollution are not distinguished and positive energy cannot
rise. This way of practice is hardly effective.
In  practice,  the  eyes  and  ears  are  the  most  difficult
points.  If  you  simply  take  the  distention  of  the  primary
opening to be the process of the work, you may experience
itching and ringing in the ears, blurriness in the eyes, and
drooling  from  the  mouth  that  must  be  consciously  drawn
in.  These  are  all  examples  of  inability  to  await  the  right
opportunity, like eyesight and light unable to combine.
If  the  opening  of  the  ears  has  not  been  shut  to  the
outside, the breath in the nose has not become subtle, the
