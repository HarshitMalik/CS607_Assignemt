False Prophets and Teachers 
1  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there 
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in 
damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and 
bring upon themselves swift destruction. 
2  And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom 
 
the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. 
3  And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make 
merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth 
 
not, and their damnation slumbereth not. 
4  ¶ For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down 
to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved 
unto judgment; 
 
5  and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a 
preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of 
the ungodly;  
 
6  and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes 
condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample 
unto those that after should live ungodly; 
 
7  and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the 
wicked:  
 
8  (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and 
hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their 
unlawful deeds:) 
 
9  the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and 
to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 
 
10  but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, 
and despise government. 
¶ Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak 
evil of dignities. 
11  Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not 
railing accusation against them before the Lord.
