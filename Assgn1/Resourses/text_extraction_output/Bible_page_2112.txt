  2113    Mark 6 
20  for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and a holy, 
and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, 
 
and heard him gladly. 
21  And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday 
made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of 
Galilee; 
 
22  and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, 
and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto 
the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 
23  And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give 
it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. 
24  And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? 
 
And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
25  And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, 
saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of 
John the Baptist. 
26  And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for 
 
their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. 
27  And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded 
his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the 
 
prison, 
28  and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel; and 
 
the damsel gave it to her mother. 
29  And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his 
corpse, and laid it in a tomb. 
The Feeding of the Five Thousand 
30  ¶ And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and 
told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had 
taught. 
31  And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert 
place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and 
 
they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
32  And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
