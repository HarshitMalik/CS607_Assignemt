  172    Exodus 21 
The People’s Fear 
18  ¶ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and 
the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when 
 
the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 
19  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: 
 
but let not God speak with us, lest we die.  
20  And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove 
 
you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 
21  ¶ And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the 
thick darkness where God was. 
22  And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the 
children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from 
heaven. 
23  Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make 
unto you gods of gold. 
24  An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice 
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and 
thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto 
 
thee, and I will bless thee. 
25  And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it 
of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast 
 
polluted it. 
26  Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy 
nakedness be not discovered thereon. 
21 
The Treatment of Servants 
1  Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 
2  If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the 
 
seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 
3  If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were 
 
married, then his wife shall go out with him.
