  1727    Jeremiah 50 
13  Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it 
shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be 
 
astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. 
14  Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that 
 
bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned 
 
against the Lord. 
15  Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her 
   
foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the 
 
vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance upon her; as she hath 
   
done, do unto her. 
16  Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle 
in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall 
 
turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his 
own land. 
17  ¶ Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first 
   
the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this 
 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 
18  Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I 
 
will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished 
the king of Assyria. 
19  And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on 
Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount 
Ephraim and Gilead. 
20  In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of 
Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of 
 
Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I 
 
reserve. 
21  ¶ Go up against the land of Merathaim [of the rebels], even against 
it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod [visitation]: waste and 
 
utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according to all 
that I have commanded thee. 
22  A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. 
23  How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! 
 
how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
