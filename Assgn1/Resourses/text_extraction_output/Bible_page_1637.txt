  1638    Jeremiah 12 
wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very 
 
treacherously? 
 
2  Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, 
 
they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from 
 
their reins. 
3  But thou, O Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine 
 
heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and 
 
prepare them for the day of slaughter. 
4  How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field 
wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts 
 
are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our 
 
last end. 
5  ¶ If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, 
then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of 
 
peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou 
do in the swelling of Jordan? 
 
6  For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have 
dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude 
 
after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto 
 
thee. 
7  ¶ I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have 
 
given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. 
8  Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against 
 
me: therefore have I hated it. 
 
9  Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about 
are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come 
 
to devour. 
10  Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my 
portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate 
wilderness. 
11  They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto 
me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to 
 
heart.
