  706    2 Samuel 6 
David Defeats the Philistines 
17  ¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David 
king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and 
 
David heard of it, and went down to the hold. 
18  The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of 
Rephaim. 
19  And David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the 
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord 
   
said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines 
 
into thine hand. 
20  And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, 
and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before 
me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that 
place Baal-perazim [the place of breaches]. 
21  And there they left their images, and David and his men burned 
them. 
22  ¶ And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in 
the valley of Rephaim. 
23  And when David inquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go 
up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over 
 
against the mulberry trees. 
24  And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of 
the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall 
 
the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. 
25  And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and smote 
 
the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

thousand.
