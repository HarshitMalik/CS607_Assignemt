  222    Exodus 39 
10  And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a 
 
topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. 
 
11  And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 
12  And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 
13  And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were 
 
inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 
14  And the stones were according to the names of the children of 
Israel, twelve according to their names, like the engravings of a 
signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 
15  And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathed 
work of pure gold. 
16  And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings, and put the 
two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 
17  And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on 
the ends of the breastplate. 
18  And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the 
two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, 
before it. 
19  And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of 
the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the 
ephod inward. 
20  And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two 
sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over 
against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the 
ephod. 
21  And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the 
ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle 
of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the 
ephod; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
22  Â¶ And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 
23  And there was a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an 
habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not 
rend. 
24  And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, 
and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
