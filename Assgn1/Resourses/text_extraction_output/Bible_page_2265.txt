  2266    John 8 
10  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he 
said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no 
 
man condemned thee? 
 
11  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I 
condemn thee: go, and sin no more. 
 
Jesus the Light of the World 
12  ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the 
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall 
 
have the light of life. 
13  The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of 
thyself; thy record is not true.  
 
14  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, 
yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; 
   
but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 
15  Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
 
16  And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I 
 
and the Father that sent me. 
17  It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 
18  I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me 
beareth witness of me. 
19  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye 
 
neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should 
 
have known my Father also. 
20  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: 
 
and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 
 
Whither I Go Ye Cannot Come 
21  ¶ Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek 
me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
 
22  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither 
 
I go, ye cannot come.
