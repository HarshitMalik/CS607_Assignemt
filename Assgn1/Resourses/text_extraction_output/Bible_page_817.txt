  818    1 Kings 19 
43  and said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he 
went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go 
again seven times. 
44  And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there 
ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, 
Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that 
the rain stop thee not. 
45  And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black 
with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, 
and went to Jezreel. 
46  And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his 
 
loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

Elijah Flees to Horeb 
1  And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he 
had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
2  Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods 
do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of 
them by tomorrow about this time. 
3  And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to 
Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. 
4  ¶ But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and 
came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for 
 
himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, 
   
take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. 
 
5  And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel 
touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. 
6  And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, 
and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid 
him down again.
