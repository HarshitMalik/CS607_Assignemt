14 
Jesus the Way to the Father 
1  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in 
 
me. 
2  In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would 
 
have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 
3  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and 
receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. 
 
4  And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 
5  Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; 
 
and how can we know the way? 
 
6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man 
 
cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
7  If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and 
 
from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 
8  ¶ Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth 
us. 
9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet 
hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen 
 
the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? 
   
10  Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? 
 
the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the 
 
Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 
11  Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else 
 
believe me for the very works’ sake. 
12  ¶ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works 
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; 
   
because I go unto my Father. 
13  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the 
Father may be glorified in the Son. 
14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
