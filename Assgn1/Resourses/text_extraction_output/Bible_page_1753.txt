  1754    Ezekiel 1 
11  Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two 
   
wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered 
their bodies. 
12  And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was 
 
to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 
 
13  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like 
burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up 
 
and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and 
 
out of the fire went forth lightning. 
14  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a 
flash of lightning. 
15  ¶ Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the 
earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 
16  The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the 
color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their 
   
appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a 
wheel. 
17  When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned 
 
not when they went. 
18  As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and 
 
their rings were full of eyes round about them four. 
19  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and 
 
when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels 
were lifted up. 
20  Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their 
spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for 
   
the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
21  When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; 
   
and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were 
lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was 
 
in the wheels.  
22  ¶ And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living 
creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over 
their heads above.
