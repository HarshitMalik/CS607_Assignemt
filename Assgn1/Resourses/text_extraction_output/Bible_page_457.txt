  458    Deuteronomy 21 
5  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the 
 
Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in 
the name of the Lord; and by their word shall every controversy 
 
and every stroke be tried: 
 
6  and all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall 
wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 
 
7  and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, 
neither have our eyes seen it. 
8  Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast 
redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s 
charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 
9  So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, 
when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord. 
Various Laws 
10  ¶ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the 
Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast 
taken them captive, 
11  and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire 
unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
 
12  then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave 
 
her head, and pare her nails; 
 
13  and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and 
shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother 
a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her 
 
husband, and she shall be thy wife. 
14  And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let 
her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, 
 
thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast 
humbled her. 
15  ¶ If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and 
they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and 
 
if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
