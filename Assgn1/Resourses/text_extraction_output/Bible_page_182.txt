  183    Exodus 25 
19  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the 
other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the 
 
two ends thereof. 
20  And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering 
the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to 
another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. 
 
21  And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the 
 
ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 
22  And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee 
from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which 
are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee 
in commandment unto the children of Israel. 
The Table for the Showbread 
23  Â¶ Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be 
 
the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and 
a half the height thereof. 
24  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown 
of gold round about. 
25  And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round 
about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof 
round about. 
26  And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in 
the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. 
27  Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to 
bear the table. 
28  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them 
with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 
29  And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and 
covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt 
 
thou make them. 
30  And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me always.
