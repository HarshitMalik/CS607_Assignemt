  22    Genesis 9 
Noah’s Drunkenness 
18  ¶ And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and 
Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 
 
19  These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth 
 
overspread. 
20  ¶ And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
 
21  and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered 
 
within his tent. 
22  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, 
and told his two brethren without. 
23  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their 
shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their 
father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their 
 
father’s nakedness. 
24  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son 
had done unto him. 
25  And he said, 
Cursed be Canaan; 
 
a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 
26  And he said, 
Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; 
 
and Canaan shall be his servant. 
27  God shall enlarge Japheth, 
and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; 
 
and Canaan shall be his servant. 
28  ¶ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
29  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he 
 
died.
