  2006    Malachi 3 
15  And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the Spirit. And 
 
wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take 
 
heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife 
of his youth. 
16  For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: 
 
for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord of 
hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not 
 
treacherously. 
The Near Approach of the Day of Judgment 
17  ¶ Ye have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein 
have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is 
 
good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, 
 
Where is the God of judgment? 
 
3 
1  Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way 
before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his 
 
temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: 
 
behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. 
2  But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand 
 
when he appeareth?  
 
¶ For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: 
 
3  and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify 
 
the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may 
offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. 
4  Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. 
5  ¶ And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift 
 
witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and 
against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in 
his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the 
stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.
