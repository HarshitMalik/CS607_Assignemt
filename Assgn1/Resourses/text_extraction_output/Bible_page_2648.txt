  2649    Revelation 21 
21 
The New Heaven and the New Earth 
1  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and 
 
the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. 
 
2  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from 
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  
3  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the 
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and 
they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be 
their God. 
4  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall 
 
be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be 
any more pain: for the former things are passed away. 
 
5  ¶ And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things 
new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and 
 
faithful. 
6  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the 
beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the 
fountain of the water of life freely.  
7  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, 
 
and he shall be my son.  
8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and 
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all 
liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and 
brimstone: which is the second death. 
 
The New Jerusalem 
9  ¶ And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the 
seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, 
saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
