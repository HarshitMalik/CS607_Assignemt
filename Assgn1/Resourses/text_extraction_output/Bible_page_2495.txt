  2496    Ephesians 5 
12  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of 
them in secret. 
13  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for 
 
whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 
14  Wherefore he saith, 
Awake thou that sleepest, 
and arise from the dead, 
and Christ shall give thee light. 
15  ¶ See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 
16  redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 
17  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of 
the Lord is. 
18  And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with 
 
the Spirit; 
 
19  speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, 
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
 
20  giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  
 
21  submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. 
Be Subject to One Another 
22  ¶ Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the 
Lord. 
23  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head 
of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 
 
24  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to 
their own husbands in every thing. 
25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, 
and gave himself for it; 
 
26  that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by 
the word, 
27  that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having 
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and 
 
without blemish.
