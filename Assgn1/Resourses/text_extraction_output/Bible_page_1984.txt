  1985    Zechariah 3 
12  And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and 
shall choose Jerusalem again. 
13  ¶ Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord: for he is raised up out of 
 
his holy habitation.

The Prophet’s Vision of Joshua the High Priest 
1  And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel 
of the Lord, and Satan [an adversary] standing at his right hand to 
resist him.  
2  And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; 
 
even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this 
 
a brand plucked out of the fire? 
 
3  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the 
angel. 
4  And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, 
saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he 
said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from the thee, and 
I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
5  And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair 
mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the 
angel of the Lord stood by. 
6  ¶ And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying, 
7  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if 
 
thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and 
shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among 
these that stand by. 
8  Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit 
before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring 
   
forth my servant the Branch.  
9  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone 
 
shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith
