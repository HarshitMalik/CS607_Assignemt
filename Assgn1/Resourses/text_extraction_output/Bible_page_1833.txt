rivers and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that 
are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of 
the heathen that are round about; 
 
5  therefore thus saith the Lord God; Surely in the fire of my jealousy 
 
have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all 
Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with 
the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a 
prey. 
6  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the 
mountains and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys, Thus

thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men. 
13  Thus saith the Lord God; Because they say unto you, Thou land

14  therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy 
nations any more, saith the Lord God. 
15  Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen 
any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any
