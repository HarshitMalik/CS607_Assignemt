  1371    Psalms 119 
143  Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: 
 
yet thy commandments are my delights. 
144  The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: 
 
give me understanding, and I shall live. 
koph 
145  I cried with my whole heart; 
 
hear me, O Lord: 
 
I will keep thy statutes. 
146  I cried unto thee; 
 
save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. 
147  I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: 
 
I hoped in thy word. 
148  Mine eyes prevent the night watches, 
that I might meditate in thy word. 
149  Hear my voice according unto thy loving-kindness: 
 
O Lord, quicken me according to thy judgment. 
150  They draw nigh that follow after mischief: 
 
they are far from thy law. 
151  Thou art near, O Lord; 
 
and all thy commandments are truth. 
152  Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old 
that thou hast founded them for ever. 
resh 
153  Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: 
 
for I do not forget thy law. 
154  Plead my cause, and deliver me: 
 
quicken me according to thy word. 
155  Salvation is far from the wicked: 
 
for they seek not thy statutes. 
156  Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: 
 
quicken me according to thy judgments. 
157  Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; 
 
yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. 
158  I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; 
 
because they kept not thy word.
