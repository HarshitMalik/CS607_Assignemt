  1221    Psalms 19 
I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 
43  Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; 
 
and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: 
 
a people whom I have not known shall serve me. 
44  As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: 
 
the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. 
45  The strangers shall fade away, 
and be afraid out of their close places. 
46  The Lord liveth; and blessed be my Rock; 
   
and let the God of my salvation be exalted. 
47  It is God that avengeth me, 
and subdueth the people under me. 
48  He delivereth me from mine enemies: 
 
yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: 
 
thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
49  Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the 
heathen, 
and sing praises unto thy name.  
50  Great deliverance giveth he to his king; 
 
and showeth mercy to his anointed, 
to David, and to his seed for evermore.

The Works and Word of God 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  The heavens declare the glory of God; 
 
and the firmament showeth his handiwork. 
2  Day unto day uttereth speech, 
and night unto night showeth knowledge. 
3  There is no speech nor language, 
where their voice is not heard.
