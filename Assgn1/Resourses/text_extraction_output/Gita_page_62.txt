BHAGAVAD GITA
Yena bhootaanyasheshena drakshyasyaatmanyatho mayi.
35. Knowing that, thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again become deluded like this; and by that thou
shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me!
Api chedasi paapebhyah sarvebhyah paapakrittamah;
Sarvam jnaanaplavenaiva vrijinam santarishyasi.
36. Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the
raft of knowledge.
COMMENTARY: One can overcome sin through Self-knowledge.
Yathaidhaamsi samiddho’gnir bhasmasaat kurute’rjuna;
Jnaanaagnih sarvakarmaani bhasmasaat kurute tathaa.
37. As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce
all actions to ashes!
Na hi jnaanena sadrisham pavitram iha vidyate;
Tat swayam yogasamsiddhah kaalenaatmani vindati.
38. Verily there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga
finds it in the Self in time.
Shraddhaavaan labhate jnaanam tatparah samyatendriyah;
Jnaanam labdhvaa paraam shaantim achirenaadhigacchati.
39. The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued all the senses,
obtains (this) knowledge; and, having obtained the knowledge, he goes at once to the supreme
peace.
Ajnashchaashraddhadhaanashcha samshayaatmaa vinashyati;
Naayam loko’sti na paro na sukham samshayaatmanah.
40. The ignorant, the faithless, the doubting self proceeds to destruction; there is neither this
world nor the other nor happiness for the doubting.
Yogasannyasta karmaanam jnaanasamcchinnasamshayam;
Aatmavantam na karmaani nibadhnanti dhananjaya.
41. He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge,
and who is self-possessed,—actions do not bind him, O Arjuna!
Tasmaad ajnaanasambhootam hritstham jnaanaasinaatmanah;
Cchittwainam samshayam yogam aatishthottishtha bhaarata.
