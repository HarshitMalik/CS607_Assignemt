  2287    John 14 
The Promise of the Holy Spirit 
15  ¶ If ye love me, keep my commandments. 
16  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another 
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 
 
17  even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it 
 
seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he 
   
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 
18  ¶ I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 
 
19  Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: 
   
because I live, ye shall live also. 
20  At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and 
I in you. 
21  He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that 
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I 
 
will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
22  Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt 
manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
 
23  Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep 
my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto 
 
him, and make our abode with him. 
24  He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which 
 
ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me. 
25  ¶ These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. 
26  But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will 
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things 
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 
27  Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world 
 
giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it 
be afraid. 
28  Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto 
you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the 
Father: for my Father is greater than I. 
 
29  And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is 
come to pass, ye might believe.
