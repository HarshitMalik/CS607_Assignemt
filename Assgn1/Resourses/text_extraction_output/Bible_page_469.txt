  470    Deuteronomy 27 
27 
The Law to Be Recorded on Mount Ebal 
1  And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, 
Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. 
2  And it shall be, on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the 
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee 
up great stones, and plaster them with plaster: 
 
3  and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when 
thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which 
the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and 
honey; as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee. 
 
4  Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set 
up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and 
thou shalt plaster them with plaster. 
5  And there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord thy God, an altar 
of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them. 
 
6  Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones: 
 
and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord thy 
God: 
 
7  and thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice 
before the Lord thy God. 
8  And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very 
plainly.  
9  ¶ And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, 
saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become 
 
the people of the Lord thy God. 
10  Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do 
his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this 
day.
