  1268    Psalms 53 
Selah. 
4  Thou lovest all devouring words, 
O thou deceitful tongue. 
5  God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, 
he shall take thee away, 
and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, 
and root thee out of the land of the living. 
Selah. 
6  The righteous also shall see, and fear, 
and shall laugh at him: 
 
7  Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; 
 
but trusted in the abundance of his riches, 
and strengthened himself in his wickedness. 
8  But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: 
 
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 
9  I will praise thee for ever, 
because thou hast done it: 
 
and I will wait on thy name; 
 
for it is good before thy saints.

The Folly and Wickedness of Men 
To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  The fool hath said in his heart, 
There is no God. 
Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: 
 
there is none that doeth good. 
2  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, 
to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. 
3  Every one of them is gone back: 
 
they are altogether become filthy;
