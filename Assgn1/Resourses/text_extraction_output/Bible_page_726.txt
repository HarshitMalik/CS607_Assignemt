  727    2 Samuel 14 
23  So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to 
Jerusalem. 
24  And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not 
see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not 
the king’s face. 
25  ¶ But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom 
for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his 
 
head there was no blemish in him. 
26  And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he 
polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) 
   
he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the 
king’s weight. 
27  And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, 
whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. 
 
28  ¶ So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the 
king’s face. 
29  Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but 
 
he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second 
 
time, he would not come. 
30  Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, 
and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s 
 
servants set the field on fire. 
31  Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said 
unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 
 
32  And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, 
Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore 
am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there 
 
still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any 
   
iniquity in me, let him kill me. 
33  So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for 
 
Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the 
ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
