  446    Deuteronomy 15 
The Treatment of Servants 
12  ¶ And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold 
unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou 
 
shalt let him go free from thee. 
13  And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let 
him go away empty: 
 
14  thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy 
floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the Lord thy 
 
God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. 
15  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of 
Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I 
 
command thee this thing today. 
16  And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; 
 
because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with 
thee; 
 
17  then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the 
door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy 
maidservant thou shalt do likewise. 
18  It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free 
from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in 
 
serving thee six years: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all 
 
that thou doest.  
The Consecration of Firstlings 
19  ¶ All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou 
shalt sanctify unto the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work with 
 
the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. 
20  Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God year by year in the place 
which the Lord shall choose, thou and thy household. 
21  And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have 
any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God. 
22  Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person 
 
shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
