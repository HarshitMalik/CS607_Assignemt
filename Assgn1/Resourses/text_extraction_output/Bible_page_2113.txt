  2114    Mark 6 
33  And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran 
afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together 
unto him. 
34  And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved 
with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not 
having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
 
35  And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, 
and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: 
 
36  send them away, that they may go into the country round about, 
and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have 
 
nothing to eat. 
37  He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say 
unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, 
and give them to eat? 
 
38  He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And 
 
when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 
39  And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon 
the green grass. 
40  And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
41  And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he 
looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave 
them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided 
 
he among them all. 
42  And they did all eat, and were filled. 
43  And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the 
fishes. 
44  And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. 
Jesus Walks on the Sea 
45  Â¶ And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, 
and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent 
away the people. 
46  And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to 
pray.
