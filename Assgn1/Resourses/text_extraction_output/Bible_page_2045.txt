  2046    Matthew 13 
The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares 
24  ¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of 
heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 
 
25  but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the 
wheat, and went his way. 
26  But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then 
appeared the tares also. 
27  So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, 
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath 
 
it tares? 
 
28  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said 
unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
 
29  But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also 
 
the wheat with them. 
30  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest 
 
I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind 
them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 
 
The Parable of the Mustard Seed 
31  ¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of 
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and 
sowed in his field: 
 
32  which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the 
 
greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the 
air come and lodge in the branches thereof. 
The Parable of the Leaven 
33  ¶ Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is 
 
like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures 
of meal, till the whole was leavened.
