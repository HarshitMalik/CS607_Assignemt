BHAGAVAD GITA
Yattu pratyupakaaraartham phalamuddishya vaa punah;
Deeyate cha pariklishtam taddaanam raajasam smritam.
21. And, that gift which is made with a view to receive something in return, or looking for a
reward, or given reluctantly, is said to be Rajasic.
Adeshakaale yaddaanamapaatrebhyashcha deeyate;
Asatkritamavajnaatam tattaamasamudaahritam.
22. The gift which is given at the wrong place and time to unworthy persons, without respect
or with insult, is declared to be Tamasic.
COMMENTARY: At the wrong place and time—at a place which is not holy, where
irreligious people and beggars assemble, where wealth acquired through illegal means such as
gambling and theft, is distributed to gamblers, singers, fools, rogues, women of evil reputation;
wealth that is distributed at an inauspicious time. This does not discourage the giving of alms to the
poor.
Om tatsaditi nirdesho brahmanas trividhah smritah;
Braahmanaastena vedaashcha yajnaashcha vihitaah puraa.
23. “Om Tat Sat”: this has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that
were created formerly the Brahmanas, the Vedas and the sacrifices.
Tasmaadomityudaahritya yajnadaanatapahkriyaah;
Pravartante vidhaanoktaah satatam brahmavaadinaam.
24. Therefore, with the utterance of “Om” are the acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity as
enjoined in the scriptures always begun by the students of Brahman.
Tadityanabhisandhaaya phalam yajnatapah kriyaah;
Daanakriyaashcha vividhaah kriyante mokshakaangkshibhih.
25. Uttering Tat, without aiming at the fruits, are the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the
various acts of gift performed by the seekers of liberation.
Sadbhaave saadhubhaave cha sadityetatprayujyate;
Prashaste karmani tathaa sacchabdah paartha yujyate.
26. The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, O Arjuna, it is
used in the sense of an auspicious act!
Yajne tapasi daane cha sthitih saditi chochyate;
Karma chaiva tadartheeyam sadityevaabhidheeyate.
