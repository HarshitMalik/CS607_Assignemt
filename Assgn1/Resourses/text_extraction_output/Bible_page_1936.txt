  1937    Amos 6 
Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and 
   
such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. 
17  And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, 
 
saith the Lord. 
18  ¶ Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is it 
 
for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light. 
 
19  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into 
 
the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. 
20  Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? even very 
 
dark, and no brightness in it? 
 
21  ¶ I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your 
solemn assemblies. 
22  Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will 
not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat 
 
beasts.  
23  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear 
 
the melody of thy viols. 
24  But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a 
mighty stream. 
25  ¶ Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness 
forty years, O house of Israel? 
 
26  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch [or, borne Siccuth 
your king] and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye 
made to yourselves. 
27  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, 
saith the Lord, whose name is The God of hosts.

The Destruction of Israel 
1  Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of 
Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house 
of Israel came!
