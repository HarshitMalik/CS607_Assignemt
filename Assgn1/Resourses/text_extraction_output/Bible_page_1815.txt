  1816    Ezekiel 28 
10  Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of 
strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. 
 
11  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
12  Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say 
unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full 
 
of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone 
 
was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, 
the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the 
carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy 
 
pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: 
   
thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up 
 
and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, 
till iniquity was found in thee. 
16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of 
thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee 
 
as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O 
 
covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast 
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee 
 
to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold 
thee. 
18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine 
iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth 
 
a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring 
thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold 
thee. 
19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at 
thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.
