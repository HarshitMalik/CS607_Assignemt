  290    Leviticus 25 
19  And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and 
dwell therein in safety. 
20  And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we 
 
shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
 
21  then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it 
shall bring forth fruit for three years. 
22  And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the 
ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store. 
 
23  The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are 
   
strangers and sojourners with me. 
24  And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption 
for the land. 
25  ¶ If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his 
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he 
redeem that which his brother sold. 
26  And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to 
redeem it; 
 
27  then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the 
overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto 
 
his possession. 
28  But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold 
shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year 
of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto 
 
his possession. 
29  ¶ And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may 
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may 
 
he redeem it. 
30  And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the 
house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him 
that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the 
 
jubilee. 
31  But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them 
shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, 
 
and they shall go out in the jubilee.
