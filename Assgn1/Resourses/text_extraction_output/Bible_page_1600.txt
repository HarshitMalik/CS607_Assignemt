  1601    Isaiah 62 
7  For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall 
 
rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess 
 
the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. 
 
8  ¶ For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; 
 
and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting 
covenant with them. 
9  And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their 
offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge 
 
them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed. 
10  ¶ I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my 
God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he 
 
hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom 
decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself 
with her jewels.  
11  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth 
the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will 
 
cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the 
nations. 
62 
1  For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I 
will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, 
and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. 
2  And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy 
glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of 
 
the Lord shall name. 
3  Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a 
royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
4  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any 
 
more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah [my 
 
delight is in her], and thy land Beulah [married]: for the Lord 
 
delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
