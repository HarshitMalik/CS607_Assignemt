  2478    Galatians 2 
Paul’s Ministry of the True Gospel 
11  ¶ But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of 
me is not after man. 
12  For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the 
revelation of Jesus Christ. 
13  For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ 
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, 
and wasted it:  
 
14  and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine 
own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my 
fathers.  
15  But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s 
womb, and called me by his grace, 
16  to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the 
heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
   
17  neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before 
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 
 
18  ¶ Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and 
abode with him fifteen days. 
19  But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother. 
20  Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie 
not. 
21  Afterward I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
 
22  and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were 
in Christ: 
 
23  but they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past 
now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
24  And they glorified God in me.

1  Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with 
Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
