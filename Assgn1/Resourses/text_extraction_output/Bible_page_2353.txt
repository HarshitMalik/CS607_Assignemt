  2354    Acts 16 
23  And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them 
into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely: 
 
24  who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner 
prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. 
25  ¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto 
God: and the prisoners heard them. 
 
26  And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations 
of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were 
 
opened, and every one’s bands were loosed. 
27  And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing 
the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have 
killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. 
28  But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we 
 
are all here. 
29  Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and 
fell down before Paul and Silas, 
30  and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
 
31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be 
saved, and thy house. 
32  And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were 
in his house. 
33  And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their 
stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. 
 
34  And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before 
them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. 
35  ¶ And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, 
Let those men go. 
36  And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The 
magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in 
 
peace. 
37  But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly 
uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and 
 
now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come 
   
themselves and fetch us out.
