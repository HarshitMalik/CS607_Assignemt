developing.  It  is  none  other  than  mastering  seriousness.
Even  though  the  Great  Way  has  no  practice  and  no
realization,  materialism  must  be  polished  away  day  by
day.
People  have  but  one  mind.  When  you  want  it  to  stay
inside, whose mind is this? When it suddenly runs outside,
whose  mind  is  this?  When  you  can  discern  clearly,  then
you can make progress at cultivation.
Self-examination  ought  to  be  thorough  and  precise.
Self-government  ought  to  be  effective  and  decisive.
Conscious  development  ought  to  be  easygoing  and
unhurried. These three exercises should be done every day
until  you  reach  the  point  of  effortlessness;  then  they  are
accomplished.
Some say we can transcend immediately to the beyond
without  having  to  make  any  effort.  This  might  occur
among those with higher knowledge, but I would not dare
say that everyone can do it.
RESPECT
The  spiritual  light  of  basic  nature  has  no  creation  or
destruction,  no  increase  or  decrease.  Even  though  it  be
tightly  covered  for  a  long  time,  one  flash  of  the  spiritual
light can extinguish a thousand evils and give birth to ten
thousand virtues.
As  long  as  you  keep  the  spiritual  light  always  present,
how are you different from sages?
