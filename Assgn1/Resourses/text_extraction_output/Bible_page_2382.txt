  2383    Acts 27 
31  and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, 
saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
32  Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at 
liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

Paul Sails for Rome 
1  And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they 
delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a 
centurion of Augustus’ band. 
2  And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning 
to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of 
 
Thessalonica, being with us. 
3  And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously 
entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh 
himself. 
4  And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, 
because the winds were contrary. 
5  And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we 
came to Myra, a city of Lycia. 
6  And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into 
Italy; and he put us therein. 
 
7  And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come 
over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under 
Crete, over against Salmone; 
 
8  and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called the Fair 
Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. 
 
9  ¶ Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now 
dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished 
them, 
10  and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with 
hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of 
our lives.
