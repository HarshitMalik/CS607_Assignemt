  1513    Isaiah 11 
7  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie 
 
down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
 
8  And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the 
weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. 
9  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the 
 
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters 
cover the sea.  
10  ¶ And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for 
an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest 
   
shall be glorious. 
11  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his 
hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, 
which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from 
Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and 
from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
12  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble 
the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah 
from the four corners of the earth. 
13  The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah 
shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not 
 
vex Ephraim. 
14  But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the 
west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their 
   
hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall 
 
obey them. 
15  And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; 
 
and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, 
and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry-
shod.  
16  And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which 
shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he 
 
came up out of the land of Egypt.
