Ecclesiastes 
Or, the Preacher 
[Ecclesiastes] 
1 
All Is Vanity 
1  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is 
 
vanity. 
3  What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the 
sun? 
 
4  One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but 
 
the earth abideth for ever. 
5  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his 
place where he arose. 
6  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the 
north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again 
 
according to his circuits. 
7  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place 
   
from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. 
8  All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not 
   
satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 
9  The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is 
 
done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the 
 
sun. 
10  Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath 
 
been already of old time, which was before us. 
11  There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any 
 
remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come 
after.
