  1867    Ezekiel 48 
12  And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a 
thing most holy by the border of the Levites. 
13  And over against the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five 
and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all 
 
the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten 
thousand. 
14  And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the 
firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the Lord. 
 
15  ¶ And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against 
the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, 
for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst 
 
thereof. 
16  And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four 
 
thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and 
five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, 
and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
17  And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred 
and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward 
the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred 
and fifty. 
18  And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy 
portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: 
 
and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the 
 
increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city. 
19  And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of 
Israel. 
20  All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and 
twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with 
 
the possession of the city. 
21  ¶ And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the 
other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over 
against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the 
east border, and westward over against the five and twenty 
thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the
