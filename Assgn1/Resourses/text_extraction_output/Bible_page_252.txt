  253    Leviticus 12 
46  ¶ This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living 
creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that 
creepeth upon the earth: 
 
47  to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and 
between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be 
eaten. 
12 
The Purification of Women after Childbirth 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have 
conceived seed, and borne a man child, then she shall be unclean 
seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity 
 
shall she be unclean. 
3  And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.  
4  And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and 
thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the 
 
sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. 
5  But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as 
in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her 
 
purifying threescore and six days. 
6  ¶ And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for 
a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt 
offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, 
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the 
priest: 
 
7  who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for 
her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is 
 
the law for her that hath borne a male or a female. 
8  And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two 
turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and 
 
the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement 
 
for her, and she shall be clean.
