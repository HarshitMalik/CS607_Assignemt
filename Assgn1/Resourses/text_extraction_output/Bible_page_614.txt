of thine husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, 
 
and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou 
knewest not heretofore. 
12  The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of 
the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. 
13  Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou

14  ¶ And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of 
the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the 
reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was 
 
sufficed, and left. 
15  And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young 
men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach 
her not: 
 
16  and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave 
them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. 
17  ¶ So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had 
gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. 
 
18  And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law 
 
saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her 
 
that she had reserved after she was sufficed. 
19  And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned 
today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take 
   
knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom 
she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought 
today is Boaz. 
20  And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the 
Lord, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the 
dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, 
one of our next kinsmen. 
21  And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt 
keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
