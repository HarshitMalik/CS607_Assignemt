  200    Exodus 31 
37  And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to 
yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto 
 
thee holy for the Lord. 
38  Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even 
be cut off from his people.

The Call of Bezaleel and Aholiab 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, 
of the tribe of Judah: 
 
3  and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in 
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of 
workmanship, 
4  to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in 
brass, 
5  and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to 
work in all manner of workmanship. 
6  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of 
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are 
 
wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have 
commanded thee; 
 
7  the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, 
and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the 
tabernacle, 
8  and the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all 
his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
9  and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver 
and his foot, 
10  and the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the 
priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priestâ€™s 
office,
