  912    1 Chronicles 4 
18  And his wife Jehudijah bare Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber 
the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah. And these 
are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took. 
19  And the sons of his wife Hodiah the sister of Naham, the father of 
Keilah the Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maachathite. 
20  And the sons of Shimon were, Amnon, and Rinnah, Ben-hanan, 
and Tilon. And the sons of Ishi were, Zoheth, and Ben-zoheth. 
21  The sons of Shelah the son of Judah were, Er the father of Lecah, 
and Laadah the father of Mareshah, and the families of the house of 
them that wrought fine linen, of the house of Ashbea, 
22  and Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who 
had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubi-lehem. And these are 
ancient things. 
23  These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and 
hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work. 
 
The Descendants of Simeon 
24  Â¶ The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and 
Shaul: 
 
25  Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son. 
26  And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei 
 
his son. 
27  And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brethren 
 
had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to 
the children of Judah. 
28  And they dwelt at Beer-sheba, and Moladah, and Hazar-shual, 
29  and at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad, 
30  and at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag, 
31  and at Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susim, and at Beth-birei, and at 
Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David. 
32  And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and 
Ashan, five cities: 
 
33  and all their villages that were round about the same cities, unto 
Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.
