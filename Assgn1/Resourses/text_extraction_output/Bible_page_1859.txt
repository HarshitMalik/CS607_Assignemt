  1860    Ezekiel 45 
12  And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and 
 
twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. 
13  ¶ This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah 
 
of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of 
a homer of barley: 
 
14  concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the 
tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for 
 
ten baths are a homer: 
 
15  and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat 
pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and 
 
for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord 
God. 
16  All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in 
Israel. 
17  And it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, and meat 
offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, 
and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he 
 
shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt 
offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the 
house of Israel. 
18  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; In the first month, in the first day of the 
 
month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and 
cleanse the sanctuary: 
 
19  and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it 
upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle 
of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
20  And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one 
that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the 
 
house. 
21  ¶ In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall 
have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be 
 
eaten.  
22  And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all 
the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
