  2541    2 Timothy 4 
8  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist 
the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
 
9  But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest 
 
unto all men, as theirs also was. 
Paul’s Last Charge to Timothy 
10  ¶ But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, 
faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, 
11  persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at 
Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all 
   
the Lord delivered me. 
12  Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer 
persecution. 
13  But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, 
and being deceived. 
14  But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast 
been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 
 
15  and that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which 
are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in 
Christ Jesus. 
16  All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for 
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in 
righteousness: 
 
17  that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all 
good works. 
4 
1  I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who 
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his 
kingdom; 
 
2  preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, 
   
rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.
