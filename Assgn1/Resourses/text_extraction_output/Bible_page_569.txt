  570    Judges 6 
31  And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for 
Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to 
   
death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for 
 
himself, because one hath cast down his altar. 
32  Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal [let Baal plead], 
saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down 
his altar. 
33  ¶ Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of 
the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the 
valley of Jezreel. 
34  But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a 
trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. 
 
35  And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was 
 
gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto 
 
Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. 
 
36  ¶ And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, 
as thou hast said, 
37  behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on 
 
the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I 
know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. 
38  And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the 
 
fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of 
water. 
39  And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, 
and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this 
 
once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and 
 
upon all the ground let there be dew. 
40  And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and 
 
there was dew on all the ground.
