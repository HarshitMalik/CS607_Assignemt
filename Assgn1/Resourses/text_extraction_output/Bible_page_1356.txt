  1357    Psalms 115 
and ye little hills, like lambs? 
 
7  Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, 
at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
 
8  which turned the rock into a standing water,  
the flint into a fountain of waters.

but unto thy name give glory, 
for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. 
2  Wherefore should the heathen say,

6  they have ears, but they hear not: 
 
noses have they, but they smell not: 
 
7  they have hands, but they handle not: 
 
feet have they, but they walk not: 
 
neither speak they through their throat. 
8  They that make them are like unto them; 
 
so is every one that trusteth in them.  
9  O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: 
 
he is their help and their shield. 
10  O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: 
 
he is their help and their shield. 
11  Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: 
 
he is their help and their shield. 
12  The Lord hath been mindful of us:
