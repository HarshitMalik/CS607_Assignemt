  1745    Lamentations 3 
give thyself no rest; 
 
let not the apple of thine eye cease. 
19  Arise, cry out in the night: 
 
in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water 
before the face of the Lord: 
 
lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, 
that faint for hunger in the top of every street. 
20  Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this. 
Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? 
 
Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the 
Lord? 
 
21  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: 
 
my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; 
 
thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; 
 
thou hast killed, and not pitied. 
22  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, 
so that in the day of the Lord’s anger none escaped nor remained: 
 
those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy 
consumed.

Hope of Relief through God’s Mercy 
1  I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 
2  He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. 
3  Surely against me is he turned; 
 
he turneth his hand against me all the day. 
4  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; 
 
he hath broken my bones. 
5  He hath builded against me, 
and compassed me with gall and travail. 
6  He hath set me in dark places, 
as they that be dead of old. 
7  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
