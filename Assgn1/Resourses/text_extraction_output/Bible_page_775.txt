  776    1 Kings 6 
25  And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one 
 
measure and one size. 
26  The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the 
other cherub. 
27  And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they 
 
stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the 
one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched 
the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of 
 
the house. 
28  And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.  
29  ¶ And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved 
figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and 
without. 
30  And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and 
without. 
31  ¶ And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the 
 
lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall. 
32  The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them 
 
carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and 
overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and 
upon the palm trees. 
33  ¶ So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a 
fourth part of the wall. 
34  And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door 
 
were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
35  And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: 
 
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work. 
36  And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a 
row of cedar beams. 
37  ¶ In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord 
laid, in the month Zif: 
 
38  and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth 
month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, 
and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in 
building it.
