  571    Judges 7

Gideon’s Men Defeat the Midianites 
1  Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with 
him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the 
 
host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of 
Moreh, in the valley. 
2  ¶ And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee 
are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest 
Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath 
saved me. 
3  Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 
Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early 
from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and 
two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 
 
4  ¶ And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; 
 
bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee 
there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go 
 
with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say 
 
unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. 
5  So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said 
 
unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, 
as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one 
 
that boweth down upon his knees to drink. 
6  And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their 
mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people 
 
bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 
7  And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that 
lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: 
 
and let all the other people go every man unto his place. 
8  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and 
 
he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained 
those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him 
 
in the valley.
