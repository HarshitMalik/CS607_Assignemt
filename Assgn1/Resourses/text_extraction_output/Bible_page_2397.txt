  2398    Romans 4 
The Promise Realized through Faith 
13  ¶ For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not 
to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the 
righteousness of faith. 
14  For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the 
promise made of none effect:  
 
15  because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no 
 
transgression. 
16  ¶ Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the 
 
promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of 
 
the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is 
 
the father of us all,  
17  (as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before 
him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and 
calleth those things which be not as though they were: 
 
18  who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the 
father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So 
shall thy seed be.  
19  And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now 
dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the 
deadness of Sarah’s womb: 
 
20  he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was 
 
strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
 
21  and being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able 
also to perform. 
22  And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
23  Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to 
him; 
 
24  but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him 
that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 
 
25  who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our 
justification.
