  1710    Jeremiah 43 
43 
The Migration to Egypt 
1  And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of 
speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, 
for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, even all these 
words, 
2  then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of 
Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou 
speakest falsely: the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, Go 
 
not into Egypt to sojourn there: 
 
3  but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to 
deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to 
death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 
4  So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and 
all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the 
land of Judah. 
5  But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, 
took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, 
whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; 
 
6  even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and 
every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left 
with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and 
Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
7  So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice 
 
of the Lord: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. 
 
8  ¶ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, 
saying, 
9  Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the 
brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in 
the sight of the men of Judah; 
 
10  and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; 
 
Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon,
