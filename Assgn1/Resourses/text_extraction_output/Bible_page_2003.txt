  2004    Malachi 2 
9  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: 
 
this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith 
   
the Lord of hosts. 
10  Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? 
 
neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no 
pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an 
offering at your hand. 
11  For, from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the 
same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every 
 
place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: 
 
for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of 
hosts. 
12  But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is 
polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. 
 
13  Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at 
 
it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and 
 
the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept 
   
this of your hand? saith the Lord. 
 
14  But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and 
voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a 
 
great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful 
among the heathen.

Israelâ€™s Unfaithfulness Rebuked 
1  And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. 
2  If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory 
unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse 
upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them 
 
already, because ye do not lay it to heart. 
3  Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, 
even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away 
 
with it.
