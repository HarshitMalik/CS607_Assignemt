  2555    Hebrews 4 
although the works were finished from the foundation of the 
world. 
4  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, 
And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  
5  And in this place again, 
If they shall enter into my rest.  
6  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and 
they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of 
unbelief: 
 
7  again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so 
long a time; as it is said, 
 
Today if ye will hear his voice, 
harden not your hearts.  
8  For if Jesus [Joshua] had given them rest, then would he not 
afterward have spoken of another day. 
9  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
10  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his 
own works, as God did from his.  
11  ¶ Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall 
after the same example of unbelief. 
12  For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any 
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and 
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the 
thoughts and intents of the heart. 
13  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all 
 
things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we 
have to do. 
Jesus the Great High Priest 
14  ¶ Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into 
the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 
15  For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the 
feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we 
 
are, yet without sin.
