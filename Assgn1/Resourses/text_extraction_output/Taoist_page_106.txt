Chuang-tzu said, “Those who arrive at the truth of life
do not strive for anything that has nothing to do with life.”
What  has  nothing  to  do  with  life  is  anything  excessive.
Simple  food  and  old  clothes  are  enough  to  take  care  of
essential  life;  why  do  you  need  wine,  meat,  and  silk  for
your life to be complete?
So  whatever  is  not  necessary  for  life  should  be
eliminated,  and  so  should  anything  that  is  excessive
beyond  the  needs  of  life.  Possessions  have  an  injurious
energy, which hurts people when it builds up. Even if you
have  few  possessions,  you  still  worry  about  them;  how
much the more when you have a lot!
If  you  tried  to  shoot  a  sparrow  with  a  jewel,  people
would laugh at you; how much the more ridiculous it is to
turn  your  back  on  the  Way  and  virtue,  slight  nature  and
life, and shorten your life span by pursuing inessentials!
If we compare fame and prestige to the Way and virtue,
fame and prestige are artificial and base, whereas the Way
and virtue are real and noble. If you can tell the noble from
the base, you should get rid of the one and take the other,
not  hurting  your  body  on  account  of  fame,  not  changing
your  will  on  account  of  prestige.  Chuang-tzu  said,  “One
who loses himself by working for fame is no gentleman.”
The Scripture on the Western Ascent says, “Embrace the
fundamental, keep to unity.” Spiritual immortalists who go
to  excess  cannot  keep  to  unity;  they  just  sit  in  offices  of
glory.  If  you  are  not  selective,  everything  you  come  in
