  649    1 Samuel 14 
16  ¶ And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, 
 
behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating 
down one another. 
17  Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, 
and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, 
behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
18  And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark 
of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
19  And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the 
noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: 
 
and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 
20  And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled 
themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s 
 
sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great 
discomfiture. 
21  Moreover, the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that 
time, which went up with them into the camp from the country 
round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that 
were with Saul and Jonathan. 
22  Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount 
Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also 
followed hard after them in the battle. 
23  So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto 
 
Beth-aven. 
24  ¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had 
 
adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food 
until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of 
the people tasted any food. 
25  And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon 
 
the ground. 
26  And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey 
dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people 
   
feared the oath. 
27  But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with 
the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
