  2312    Acts 2 
36  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath 
made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and 
Christ. 
37  ¶ Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and 
said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, 
what shall we do? 
 
38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of 
you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye 
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that 
are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. 
40  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save 
yourselves from this untoward generation. 
41  Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the 
 
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. 
42  And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and 
fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 
Life among the Believers 
43  ¶ And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs 
 
were done by the apostles. 
44  And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  
 
45  and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as 
every man had need.  
46  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and 
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with 
gladness and singleness of heart, 
47  praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord 
added to the church daily such as should be saved.
