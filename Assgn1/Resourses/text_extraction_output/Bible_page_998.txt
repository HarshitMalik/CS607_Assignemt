  999    2 Chronicles 13 
12  And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests 
with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of 
Israel, fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers; for ye 
 
shall not prosper. 
13  Â¶ But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind 
them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind 
 
them. 
14  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and 
behind: and they cried unto the Lord, and the priests sounded 
 
with the trumpets. 
15  Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah 
 
shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel 
before Abijah and Judah. 
16  And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered 
 
them into their hand. 
17  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so 
 
there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
18  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and 
the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord 
God of their fathers. 
19  And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, 
Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns 
thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. 
20  Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: 
 
and the Lord struck him, and he died. 
21  But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat 
twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
22  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are 
written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
