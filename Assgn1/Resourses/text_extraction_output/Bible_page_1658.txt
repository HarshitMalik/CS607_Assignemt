  1659    Jeremiah 22 
15  Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy 
 
father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was 
well with him? 
 
16  He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with 
 
him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord. 
   
17  But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and 
for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to 
do it. 
18  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of 
Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my 
 
brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah 
   
lord! or, Ah his glory! 
   
19  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth 
beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 
20  ¶ Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and 
 
cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed. 
 
21  I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. 
 
This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not 
my voice. 
22  The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into 
captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all 
 
thy wickedness. 
23  O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how 
gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a 
woman in travail! 
 
24  ¶ As I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim 
king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I 
pluck thee thence; 
 
25  and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and 
into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the 
Chaldeans. 
26  And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into 
another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
