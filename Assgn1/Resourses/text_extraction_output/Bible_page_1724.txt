  1725    Jeremiah 50 
32  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a 
spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost 
 
corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith 
 
the Lord. 
33  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for 
ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in 
 
it. 
The Prophecy concerning Elam 
34  ¶ The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against 
Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, 
saying, 
35  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of 
 
Elam, the chief of their might. 
36  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters 
of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there 
 
shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. 
37  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and 
before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, 
 
even my fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword 
 
after them, till I have consumed them: 
 
38  and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the 
king and the princes, saith the Lord. 
39  ¶ But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again 
the captivity of Elam, saith the Lord.
