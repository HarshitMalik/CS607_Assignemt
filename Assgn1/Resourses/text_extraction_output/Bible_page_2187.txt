  2188    Luke 10 
The Would-be Followers of Jesus 
57  Â¶ And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man 
said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 
58  And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have 
nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 
 
59  And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me 
first to go and bury my father. 
60  Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and 
 
preach the kingdom of God. 
61  And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go 
 
bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.  
62  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, 
and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

The Mission of the Seventy 
1  After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent 
them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither 
he himself would come. 
2  Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the 
laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he 
 
would send forth laborers into his harvest.  
3  Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.  
 
4  Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the 
 
way. 
5  And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this 
house. 
6  And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if 
 
not, it shall turn to you again. 
7  And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as 
they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house 
 
to house.
