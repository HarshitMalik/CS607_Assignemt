  2041    Matthew 12 
14  Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how 
they might destroy him. 
The Chosen Servant 
15  ¶ But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and 
 
great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 
 
16  and charged them that they should not make him known: 
 
17  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, 
saying, 
18  Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; 
 
my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: 
 
I will put my Spirit upon him, 
and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles. 
19  He shall not strive, nor cry; 
 
neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. 
20  A bruised reed shall he not break, 
and smoking flax shall he not quench, 
till he send forth judgment unto victory. 
21  And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  
A Divided House Cannot Stand 
22  ¶ Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, 
and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb 
 
both spake and saw. 
23  And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of 
David? 
 
24  But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast 
out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  
25  And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every 
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every 
 
city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 
 
26  and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall 
 
then his kingdom stand?
