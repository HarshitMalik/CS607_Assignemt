  2567    Hebrews 11 
35  Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great 
recompense of reward. 
36  For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of 
God, ye might receive the promise. 
37  For yet a little while, 
and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. 
38  Now the just shall live by faith: 
 
but if any man draw back, 
my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  
39  But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them 
 
that believe to the saving of the soul.

Faith 
1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of 
things not seen. 
2  For by it the elders obtained a good report. 
3  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the 
word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things 
which do appear. 
4  Â¶ By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than 
Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God 
testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  
 
5  By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was 
 
not found, because God had translated him: for before his 
 
translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  
6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh 
 
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them 
that diligently seek him. 
7  By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, 
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the 
 
which he condemned the world, and became heir of the 
righteousness which is by faith.
