  2495    Ephesians 5 
29  Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that 
which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto 
the hearers. 
30  And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto 
the day of redemption. 
31  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil 
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 
 
32  and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one 
another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.  
5 
Walk as Children of Light 
1  Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 
 
2  and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given 
himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling 
savor.  
3  ¶ But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be 
once named among you, as becometh saints; 
 
4  neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not 
convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 
 
5  For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor 
covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the 
kingdom of Christ and of God. 
6  Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these 
 
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 
7  Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 
8  For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: 
 
walk as children of light; 
 
9  (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and 
truth;) 
 
10  proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 
11  And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but 
rather reprove them.
