Chuang-tzu  said,  “Those  who  mastered  the  Way  in
ancient  times  nurtured  wisdom  by  means  of  serenity.
Wisdom  grew,  but  they  did  not  use  wisdom  to  contrive
anything.” This is called using wisdom to nurture serenity;
when  wisdom  and  serenity  combine  to  nurture  one
another, the pattern of harmony comes from nature.
Serenity  and  wisdom  are  stabilization  and  insight.  The
pattern  of  harmony  is  the  virtue  of  the  Way.  When  you
have  wisdom  but  do  not  use  it,  remaining  peaceful  and
serene, after building this up for a long time you naturally
attain the virtue of the Way.
This  stabilization  is  accomplished  by  effort.  It  may  be
based  on  observing  advantage  and  seeing  harm,  stopping
the mind out of fear of calamity, discarding and removing
accumulated habits. In any case, when the mind is mature
you wind up stabilized, just as if it were naturally so. Even
a thunderclap that shatters a mountain does not startle you,
naked swords may cross before your eyes and yet you do
not fear. You look upon fame and fortune as transient and
know birth and death are like oozing sores. Thus we know
that  when  we  exercise  undivided  will  we  solidify  the
spirit;  then  openness  and  subtlety  of  mind  are
inconceivable.
The  mind  is  not  existent  in  and  of  itself,  but  it  is  not
nonexistent in action. It is swift without rushing, it comes
without being called. Its anger will drive an arrow all the
way into a boulder; its resentment will bring down frost in
midsummer. Indulge in evil, and the nine hells are not far
