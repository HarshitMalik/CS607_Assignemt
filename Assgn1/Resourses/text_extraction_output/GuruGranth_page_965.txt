Blessed are Your devotees, who see You, O True Lord. He alone praises You, who is 
blessed  by  Your  Grace.  One  who  meets  the  Guru,  O  Nanak,  is  immaculate  and 
sanctified.  || 20 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, this world is beautiful, but there is 
a thorny garden within it. Those who are blessed by their spiritual teacher are not even 
scratched.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Fareed, blessed is the life, with such a beautiful body. 
How rare are those who are found to love their Beloved Lord.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He 
alone  obtains  meditation,  austerities,  self-discipline,  compassion  and  Dharmic  faith, 
whom the Lord so blesses. He alone meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, 
whose  fire  the  Lord  puts  out.  The  Inner-knower,  the  Searcher  of  hearts,  the 
Inaccessible Primal Lord, inspires us to look upon all with an impartial eye. With the 
support  of  the  Saadh  Sangat,  the  Company  of  the  Holy,  one  falls  in  love  with  God. 
One‟s faults are eradicated, and one‟s face becomes radiant and bright; through the 
Lord‟s Name, one crosses over. The fear of birth and death is removed, and he is not 
reincarnated  again.  God  lifts  him  up  and  pulls  him  out  of  the  deep,  dark  pit,  and 
attaches him to the hem of His robe. O Nanak, God forgives him, and holds him close in 
His embrace.  || 21 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  One who loves God is imbued with the 
deep crimson color of His love. O Nanak, such a person is rarely found; the value of 
such a humble person can never be estimated.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  The True Name 
has pierced the nucleus of my self deep within. Outside, I see the True Lord as well. O 
Nanak, He is pervading and permeating all places, the forests and the meadows, the 
three worlds, and every hair.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He Himself created the Universe; He 
Himself imbues it. He Himself is One, and He Himself has numerous forms. He Himself 
is within all, and He Himself is beyond them. He Himself is known to be far away, and 
He Himself is right here. He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed. No one can 
estimate the value of Your Creation, Lord. You are deep and profound, unfathomable, 
infinite and invaluable. O Nanak, the One Lord is all-pervading. You are the One and 
only.  || 22 || 1 || 2 ||  SUDH  ||    
 
VAAR OF RAAMKALEE,  UTTERED BY SATTA AND BALWAND THE DRUMMER:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
One who chants the Name of the Almighty Creator — how can his words be judged? His 
divine  virtues  are  the  true  sisters  and  brothers;  through  them,  the  gift  of  supreme 
status is obtained. Nanak  established the kingdom; He built the true fortress on the 
strongest foundations. He installed the royal canopy over Lehna‟s head; chanting the 
Lord‟s  Praises,  He  drank  in  the  Ambrosial  Nectar.  The  Guru  implanted  the  almighty 
sword of the Teachings to illuminate his soul. The Guru bowed down to His disciple, 
while Nanak was still alive. The King, while still alive, applied the ceremonial mark to his 
forehead.  || 1 ||   Nanak proclaimed Lehna‟s succession — he earned it. They shared 
the  One  Light  and  the  same  way;  the  King  just  changed  His  body.  The  immaculate 
canopy waves over Him, and He sits on the throne in the Guru‟s shop.
