  343    Numbers 14 
24  but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and 
hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he 
went; and his seed shall possess it.  
 
25  (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) 
Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of 
the Red sea. 
26  Â¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
27  How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur 
against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, 
 
which they murmur against me. 
28  Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken 
in mine ears, so will I do to you: 
 
29  your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were 
numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty 
years old and upward, which have murmured against me, 
30  doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware 
to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and 
Joshua the son of Nun. 
31  But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I 
bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 
32  But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness. 
33  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and 
bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the 
wilderness. 
34  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even 
forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even 
forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 
35  I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil 
congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this 
 
wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
