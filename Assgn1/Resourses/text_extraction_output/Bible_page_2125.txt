  2126    Mark 10 
4  And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to 
put her away.  
5  And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your 
heart he wrote you this precept. 
6  But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and 
female.  
7  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to 
his wife; 
 
8  and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, 
 
but one flesh. 
9  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
10  ¶ And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. 
11  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and 
marry another, committeth adultery against her. 
12  And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to 
another, she committeth adultery.  
Jesus Blesses Little Children 
13  ¶ And they brought young children to him, that he should touch 
them; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. 
 
14  But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, 
Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for 
 
of such is the kingdom of God. 
15  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of 
God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.  
16  And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and 
blessed them. 
The Rich Young Ruler 
17  ¶ And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one 
running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what 
shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
