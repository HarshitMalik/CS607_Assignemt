  1796    Ezekiel 20 
hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your 
 
gifts, and with your idols. 
40  ¶ For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of 
Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, all of 
them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will 
 
I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with 
all your holy things. 
41  I will accept you with your sweet savor, when I bring you out from 
the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have 
been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 
 
42  And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into 
the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine 
hand to give it to your fathers. 
43  And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, 
wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in 
 
your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. 
44  And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with 
you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor 
according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the 
Lord God. 
The Prophecy against the South 
45  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
46  Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word 
toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south 
field; 
 
47  and say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord; Thus 
 
saith the Lord God; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall 
 
devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming 
 
flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the 
north shall be burned therein. 
48  And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not 
 
be quenched.
