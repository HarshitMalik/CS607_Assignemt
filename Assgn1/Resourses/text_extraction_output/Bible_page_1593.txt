  1594    Isaiah 58 
12  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not 
 
profit thee. 
13  When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind 
 
shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that 
   
putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my 
holy mountain. 
14  Â¶ And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the 
stumblingblock out of the way of my people. 
15  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, 
whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him 
 
also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the 
humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 
16  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for 
 
the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. 
17  For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I 
 
hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his 
heart. 
18  I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and 
 
restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
19  I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to 
 
him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him. 
 
20  But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose 
waters cast up mire and dirt. 
21  There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

The Right Observance of Fasts 
1  Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my 
people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. 
2  Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation 
that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: 
 
they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in 
 
approaching to God.
