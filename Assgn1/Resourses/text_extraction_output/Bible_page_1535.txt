  1536    Isaiah 27 
thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth. 
16  Lord, in trouble have they visited thee; 
 
they poured out a prayer 
when thy chastening was upon them. 
17  Like as a woman with child, 
that draweth near the time of her delivery, 
is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; 
 
so have we been in thy sight, O Lord. 
18  We have been with child, we have been in pain, 
we have as it were brought forth wind; 
 
we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; 
 
neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 
19  Thy dead men shall live, 
together with my dead body shall they arise. 
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: 
 
for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, 
and the earth shall cast out the dead. 
20  Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, 
and shut thy doors about thee: 
 
hide thyself as it were for a little moment, 
until the indignation be overpast. 
21  For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place 
to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: 
 
the earth also shall disclose her blood, 
and shall no more cover her slain. 
27 
The Deliverance and Ingathering of Israel 
1  In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall 
punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked 
serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. 
 
2  Â¶ In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
