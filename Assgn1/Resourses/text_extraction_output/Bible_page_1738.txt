The 
Lamentations of Jeremiah 
[Lamentations] 
1 
The Sorrows of Captive Zion 
1  How doth the city sit solitary, 
that was full of people! 
 
How is she become as a widow! 
 
She that was great among the nations, 
and princess among the provinces, 
how is she become tributary! 
 
2  She weepeth sore in the night, 
and her tears are on her cheeks: 
 
among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: 
 
all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, 
they are become her enemies. 
3  Judah is gone into captivity 
because of affliction, and because of great servitude: 
 
she dwelleth among the heathen, 
she findeth no rest: 
 
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. 
4  The ways of Zion do mourn, 
because none come to the solemn feasts: 
 
all her gates are desolate: 
 
her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, 
and she is in bitterness. 
5  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; 
 
for the Lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her 
transgressions: 
 
her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. 
6  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: 
 
her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,
