  1498    Isaiah 3 
7  in that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my 
 
house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the 
 
people. 
8  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue 
 
and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his 
glory. 
9  ¶ The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and 
 
they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their 
soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 
 
10  Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall 
 
eat the fruit of their doings. 
11  Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his 
   
hands shall be given him. 
12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule 
over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and 
destroy the way of thy paths. 
13  ¶ The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 
14  The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, 
and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil 
   
of the poor is in your houses. 
15  What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces 
of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts. 
 
Judgment on the Daughters of Zion 
16  ¶ Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are 
haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, 
walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their 
feet: 
 
17  therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of 
the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret 
parts. 
18  In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling 
ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like 
the moon,
