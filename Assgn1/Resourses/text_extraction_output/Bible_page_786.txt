  787    1 Kings 9 
60  that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, 
and that there is none else. 
61  Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk 
in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. 
62  ¶ And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
Lord. 
63  And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he 
offered unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a 
hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the 
children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. 
64  The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was 
before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, 
 
and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the 
 
brazen altar that was before the Lord was too little to receive the 
burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace 
offerings. 
65  ¶ And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a 
great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river 
of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even 
fourteen days. 
66  On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the 
 
king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the 
goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for 
Israel his people.

The Lord’s Covenant with Solomon 
1  And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of 
the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s 
desire which he was pleased to do, 
2  that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had 
appeared unto him at Gibeon.
