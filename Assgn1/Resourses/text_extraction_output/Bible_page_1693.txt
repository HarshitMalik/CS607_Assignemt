  1694    Jeremiah 36 
36 
The Burning of the Roll 
1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of 
Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the 
Lord, saying, 
2  Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I 
have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and 
against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the 
days of Josiah, even unto this day. 
3  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I 
purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his 
 
evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
 
4  ¶ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch 
 
wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, 
which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. 
5  And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot 
 
go into the house of the Lord: 
 
6  therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written 
from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in 
the Lord’s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read 
 
them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. 
7  It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord, and 
will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and 
 
the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this people. 
8  And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the 
prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the 
Lord in the Lord’s house. 
9  ¶ And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah 
king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast 
before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the 
people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. 
10  Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house 
of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the
