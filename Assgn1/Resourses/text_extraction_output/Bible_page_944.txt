  945    1 Chronicles 17 
7  Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus 
saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from 
following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people 
Israel: 
 
8  and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and 
have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee 
a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
9  Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, 
and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; 
 
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at 
the beginning, 
10  and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people 
Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell 
thee, that the Lord will build thee a house. 
11  And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must 
go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, 
which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
 
12  He shall build me a house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
13  I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my 
 
mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: 
 
14  but I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: 
 
and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
15  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did 
Nathan speak unto David. 
16  ¶ And David the king came and sat before the Lord, and said, 
Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast 
brought me hitherto? 
 
17  And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast 
 
also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and 
hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O 
Lord God. 
18  What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? 
 
for thou knowest thy servant.
