  1293    Psalms 71 
whereunto I may continually resort: 
 
thou hast given commandment to save me; 
 
for thou art my rock and my fortress. 
4  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, 
out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 
5  For thou art my hope, O Lord God: 
 
thou art my trust from my youth. 
6  By thee have I been holden up from the womb: 
 
thou art he that took me out of my motherâ€™s bowels: 
 
my praise shall be continually of thee. 
7  I am as a wonder unto many; 
 
but thou art my strong refuge. 
8  Let my mouth be filled with thy praise 
and with thy honor all the day. 
9  Cast me not off in the time of old age; 
 
forsake me not when my strength faileth. 
10  For mine enemies speak against me; 
 
and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, 
11  saying, God hath forsaken him: 
 
persecute and take him; 
 
for there is none to deliver him. 
12  O God, be not far from me: 
 
O my God, make haste for my help. 
13  Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my 
soul; 
 
let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt. 
14  But I will hope continually, 
and will yet praise thee more and more. 
15  My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness 
and thy salvation all the day; 
 
for I know not the numbers thereof. 
16  I will go in the strength of the Lord God: 
 
I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. 
17  O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: 
 
and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
