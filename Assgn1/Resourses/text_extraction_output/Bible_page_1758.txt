The Siege of Jerusalem Portrayed 
1  Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and 
portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: 
 
2  and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount 
against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against 
 
it round about. 
3  Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of 
iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it 
 
shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a 
sign to the house of Israel. 
4  ¶ Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house 
of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt 
 
lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. 
5  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to 
the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt 
 
thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
6  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right 
side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty 
days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. 
 
7  Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and 
thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
8  And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn 
thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy 
siege. 
9  ¶ Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and 
lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and 
make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that 
thou shalt lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt 
 
thou eat thereof. 
10  And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty 
shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
