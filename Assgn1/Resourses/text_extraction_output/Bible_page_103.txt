  104    Genesis 43 
28  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is 
 
even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, 
 
saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 
 
29  ¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, 
and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 
 
30  The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took 
us for spies of the country. 
31  And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 
   
32  we be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the 
 
youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
33  And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I 
know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, 
 
and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 
 
34  and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye 
 
are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your 
 
brother, and ye shall traffic in the land. 
35  ¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, 
every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they 
 
and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
36  And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my 
children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take 
 
Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 
 
37  And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I 
bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring 
 
him to thee again. 
38  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is 
 
dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the 
 
which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to 
the grave.
