  1688    Jeremiah 33 
10  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Again there shall be heard in this place, 
 
which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even 
in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are 
desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, 
11  the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the 
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall 
say, Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy 
   
endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise 
 
into the house of the Lord. For I will cause to return the captivity 
of the land, as at first, saith the Lord. 
12  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Again in this place, which is 
 
desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities 
thereof, shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie 
down. 
13  In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the 
cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places 
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass 
again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the Lord. 
14  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform that 
good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to 
the house of Judah. 
15  In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of 
righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute 
 
judgment and righteousness in the land. 
16  In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: 
 
and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our 
righteousness.  
17  ¶ For thus saith the Lord; David shall never want a man to sit 
 
upon the throne of the house of Israel;  
 
18  neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer 
burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice 
continually.  
19  ¶ And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying,
