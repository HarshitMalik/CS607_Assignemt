  262    Leviticus 14 
39  and the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: 
 
and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 
 
40  then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in 
which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place 
without the city: 
 
41  and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and 
they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city 
into an unclean place: 
 
42  and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those 
stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. 
 
43  ¶ And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after 
that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the 
house, and after it is plastered; 
 
44  then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be 
spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is 
 
unclean. 
45  And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber 
thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them 
 
forth out of the city into an unclean place. 
46  Moreover, he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut 
up shall be unclean until the even. 
47  And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that 
 
eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
48  ¶ And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the 
plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; 
 
then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague 
is healed. 
49  And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, 
and scarlet, and hyssop: 
 
50  and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over 
running water: 
 
51  and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, 
and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and 
in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
