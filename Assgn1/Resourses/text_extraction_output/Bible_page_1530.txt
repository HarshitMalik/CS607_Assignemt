  1531    Isaiah 24 
up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he 
 
brought it to ruin. 
14  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. 
 
15  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten 
seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of 
 
seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot. 
16  Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; 
 
make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be 
remembered. 
17  And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall 
commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the 
face of the earth. 
18  And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord: it 
 
shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for 
 
them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for 
durable clothing. 
24 
The Lord’s Judgment on the Earth 
1  Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, 
and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants 
thereof. 
2  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the 
 
servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; 
   
as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the 
 
borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to 
 
him. 
3  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the 
 
Lord hath spoken this word. 
4  ¶ The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and 
fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
