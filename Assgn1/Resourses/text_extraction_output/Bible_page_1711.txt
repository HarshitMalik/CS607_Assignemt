  1712    Jeremiah 44 
7  Therefore now thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of 
Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut 
 
off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to 
leave you none to remain; 
 
8  in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, 
burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye 
be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might 
be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
 
9  Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the 
wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their 
wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, 
which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets 
of Jerusalem? 
 
10  They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, 
nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and 
before your fathers. 
11  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, 
 
I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. 
12  And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go 
into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be 
consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be 
 
consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the 
 
least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and 
 
they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a 
reproach. 
13  For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have 
punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the 
pestilence: 
 
14  so that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land 
of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should 
return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to 
return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape. 
 
15  ¶ Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned 
incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great
