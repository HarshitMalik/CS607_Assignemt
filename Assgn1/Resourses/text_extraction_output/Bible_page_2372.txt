  2373    Acts 23 
2  And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him 
to smite him on the mouth. 
3  Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: 
 
for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be 
smitten contrary to the law? 
 
4  And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest? 
 
5  Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for 
 
it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  
6  ¶ But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and 
the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, 
I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection 
 
of the dead I am called in question. 
7  And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the 
Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. 
 
8  For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, 
nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. 
 
9  And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the 
 
Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this 
man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight 
 
against God. 
10  And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing 
lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded 
the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among 
them, and to bring him into the castle. 
11  ¶ And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of 
good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so 
 
must thou bear witness also at Rome. 
The Plot against Paul’s Life 
12  ¶ And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and 
bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat 
nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
13  And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
