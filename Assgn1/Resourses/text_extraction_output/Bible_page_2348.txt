  2349    Acts 15 
3  And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through 
Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: 
 
and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
4  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the 
church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things 
that God had done with them. 
5  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which 
believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to 
command them to keep the law of Moses. 
6  ¶ And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this 
matter. 
7  And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said 
unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago 
God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should 
hear the word of the gospel, and believe.  
8  And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving 
them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;  
 
9  and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts 
by faith. 
10  Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of 
the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
 
11  But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we 
shall be saved, even as they. 
12  ¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to 
Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had 
wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
13  And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men 
and brethren, hearken unto me: 
 
14  Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to 
take out of them a people for his name. 
15  And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, 
 
16  After this I will return, 
and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; 
 
and I will build again the ruins thereof, 
and I will set it up:
