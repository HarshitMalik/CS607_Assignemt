  2309    Acts 2 
21  Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the 
time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
22  beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he 
was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us 
of his resurrection. 
23  And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was 
surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
24  And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts 
of all men, show whether of these two thou hast chosen, 
25  that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which 
Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. 
26  And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and 
   
he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

The Coming of the Holy Spirit 
1  And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with 
one accord in one place. 
2  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing 
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 
3  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it 
sat upon each of them. 
4  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak 
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 
5  Â¶ And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of 
every nation under heaven. 
6  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, 
and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in 
his own language. 
7  And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, 
Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? 
 
8  And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were 
born?
