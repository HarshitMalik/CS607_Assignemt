  549    Joshua 24 
12  Else, if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of 
these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make 
marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 
 
13  know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive 
out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares 
 
and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your 
eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your 
God hath given you. 
14  ¶ And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye 
 
know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing 
hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake 
concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing 
 
hath failed thereof. 
15  Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come 
upon you, which the Lord your God promised you; so shall the 
 
Lord bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you 
from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you. 
16  When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, 
which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, 
and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be 
 
kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good 
land which he hath given unto you.

Joshua’s Farewell Address 
1  And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called 
for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and 
for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
 
2  And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of 
Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, 
even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and 
 
they served other gods.
