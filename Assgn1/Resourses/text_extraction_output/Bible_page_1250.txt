  1251    Psalms 40 
before I go hence, and be no more. 
40 
Praise for Deliverance 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  I waited patiently for the Lord; 
 
and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
2  He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, 
out of the miry clay, 
and set my feet upon a rock, 
and established my goings. 
3  And he hath put a new song in my mouth, 
even praise unto our God: 
 
many shall see it, and fear, 
and shall trust in the Lord. 
4  Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, 
and respecteth not the proud, 
nor such as turn aside to lies. 
5  Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast 
done, 
and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: 
 
they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: 
 
if I would declare and speak of them, 
they are more than can be numbered. 
6  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; 
 
mine ears hast thou opened: 
 
burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. 
7  Then said I, Lo, I come: 
 
in the volume of the book it is written of me, 
8  I delight to do thy will, O my God: 
 
yea, thy law is within my heart.
