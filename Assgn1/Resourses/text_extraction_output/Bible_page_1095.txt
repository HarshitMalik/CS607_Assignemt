and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water 
gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. 
17  And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the 
captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days 
 
of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of 
Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. 
18  Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the 
book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on 
 
the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

Ezra’s Confession of Israel’s Sins 
1  Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of 
Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth 
upon them. 
2  And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and 
stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
3  And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of 
the Lord their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth 
 
part they confessed, and worshipped the Lord their God. 
4  Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, 
Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and 
cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God. 
5  Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, 
Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and 
bless the Lord your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy 
 
glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. 
6  ¶ Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the 
 
heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that 
are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest 
them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
