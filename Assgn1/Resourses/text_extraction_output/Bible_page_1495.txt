  1496    Isaiah 2 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from 
Jerusalem. 
4  And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many 
people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their 
 
spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against 
 
nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
The Lord’s Judgment on the Proud 
5  ¶ O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the 
Lord. 
6  Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because 
they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the 
Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. 
7  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of 
their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any 
 
end of their chariots: 
 
8  their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own 
 
hands, that which their own fingers have made: 
 
9  and the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth 
himself: therefore forgive them not. 
 
10  Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, 
and for the glory of his majesty. 
11  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of 
men shall be bowed down; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in 
 
that day. 
12  ¶ For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is 
proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be 
 
brought low: 
 
13  and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and 
upon all the oaks of Bashan, 
14  and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are 
lifted up, 
15  and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 
16  and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
