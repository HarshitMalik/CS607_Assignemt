  2260    John 6 
45  It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. 
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the 
Father, cometh unto me. 
46  Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he 
hath seen the Father. 
47  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath 
everlasting life. 
48  I am that bread of life. 
49  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. 
50  This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may 
eat thereof, and not die. 
51  I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man 
 
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give 
 
is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. 
52  ¶ The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can 
this man give us his flesh to eat? 
 
53  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye 
eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life 
in you. 
54  Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; 
 
and I will raise him up at the last day. 
55  For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
56  He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, 
and I in him. 
57  As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he 
 
that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 
58  This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your 
 
fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread 
 
shall live for ever. 
59  These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 
The Words of Eternal Life 
60  ¶ Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, 
This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
