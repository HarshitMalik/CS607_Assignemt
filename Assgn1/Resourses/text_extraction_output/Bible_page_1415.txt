  1416    Proverbs 8 
8  All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; 
 
there is nothing froward or perverse in them. 
9  They are all plain to him that understandeth, 
and right to them that find knowledge. 
10  Receive my instruction, and not silver; 
 
and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
11  For wisdom is better than rubies; 
 
and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 
12  I wisdom dwell with prudence, 
and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 
13  The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: 
 
pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, 
and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
14  Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: 
 
I am understanding; I have strength. 
 
15  By me kings reign, 
and princes decree justice. 
16  By me princes rule, and nobles, 
even all the judges of the earth. 
17  I love them that love me; 
 
and those that seek me early shall find me. 
18  Riches and honor are with me; 
 
yea, durable riches and righteousness. 
19  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; 
 
and my revenue than choice silver. 
20  I lead in the way of righteousness, 
in the midst of the paths of judgment: 
 
21  that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; 
 
and I will fill their treasures. 
22  The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,  
before his works of old. 
23  I was set up from everlasting, 
from the beginning, 
or ever the earth was. 
24  When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
