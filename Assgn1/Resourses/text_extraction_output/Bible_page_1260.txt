  1261    Psalms 48 
6  Sing praises to God, sing praises: 
 
sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
7  For God is the King of all the earth: 
 
sing ye praises with understanding. 
8  God reigneth over the heathen: 
 
God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 
9  The princes of the people are gathered together, 
even the people of the God of Abraham: 
 
for the shields of the earth belong unto God: 
 
he is greatly exalted.

The Beauty and Glory of Zion 
A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
1  Great is the Lord, 
and greatly to be praised 
in the city of our God, 
in the mountain of his holiness. 
2  Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, 
is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, 
the city of the great King.  
3  God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 
4  For, lo, the kings were assembled,

5  They saw it, and so they marveled; 
 
they were troubled, and hasted away. 
6  Fear took hold upon them there, 
and pain, as of a woman in travail. 
7  Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish 
with an east wind. 
8  As we have heard, so have we seen 
in the city of the Lord of hosts,
