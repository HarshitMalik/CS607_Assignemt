What sort of service is this, by which the fear of the Lord Master does not depart? O 
Nanak,  he  alone  is  called  a  servant,  who  merges  with  the  Lord  Master.    ||  2  ||   
PAUREE:  O Nanak, the Lord‟s limits cannot be known; He has no end or limitation. He 
Himself creates, and then He Himself destroys. Some have chains around their necks, 
while some ride on many horses. He Himself acts, and He Himself causes us to act. 
Unto  whom  should  I  complain?  O  Nanak,  the  One  who  created  the  creation  —  He 
Himself takes care of it.  || 23 ||   SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  He Himself fashioned the 
vessel  of  the  body,  and  He  Himself  fills  it.  Into  some,  milk  is  poured,  while  others 
remain on the fire. Some lie down and sleep on soft beds, while others remain watchful. 
He adorns those, O Nanak, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.  || 1 ||   SECOND 
MEHL:  He Himself creates and fashions the world, and He Himself keeps it in order. 
Having  created  the  beings  within  it,  He  oversees  their  birth  and  death.  Unto  whom 
should  we  speak,  O  Nanak,  when  He  Himself  is  all-in-all?    ||  2  ||      PAUREE:    The 
description of the greatness of the Great Lord cannot be described. He is the Creator, 
all-lowerful and benevolent; He gives sustenance to all beings. The mortal does that 
work, which has been pre-destined from the very beginning. O Nanak, except for the 
One Lord, there is no other place at all. He does whatever He wills.  || 24 || 1 ||  SUDH

AASAA,  KABEER JEE:   
Falling at the Feet of the Guru, I pray, and ask Him, “Why was man created? What 
deeds  cause  the  world  to  come  into  being,  and  be  destroyed?  Tell  me,  that  I  may 
understand.”  || 1 ||   O Divine Guru, please, show Mercy to me, and place me on the 
right path, by which the bonds of fear may be cut away. The pains of birth and death 
come  from  past  actions  and  karma;  peace  comes  when  the  soul  finds  release  from 
reincarnation.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The mortal does not break free from the bonds of the 
noose of Maya, and he does not seek the shelter of the profound, absolute Lord. He 
does not realize the dignity of the self, and Nirvaanaa; because of this, his doubt does 
not depart.  || 2 ||   The soul is not born, even though he thinks it is born; it is free 
from  birth  and  death.  When  the  mortal  gives  up  his  ideas  of  birth  and  death,  he 
remains constantly absorbed in the Lord‟s Love.  || 3 ||   As the reflection of an object 
blends  in  the  water  when  the  pitcher  is  broken,  says  Kabeer,  just  so  virtue  dispels 
doubt, and then the soul is absorbed in the profound, absolute Lord.
