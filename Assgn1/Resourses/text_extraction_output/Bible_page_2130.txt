  2131    Mark 11 
overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them 
that sold doves; 
 
16  and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through 
the temple. 
17  And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall 
be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a 
 
den of thieves.  
18  And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they 
might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was 
 
astonished at his doctrine. 
19  And when even was come, he went out of the city. 
The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree 
20  Â¶ And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried 
up from the roots. 
21  And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, 
the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. 
22  And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 
23  For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this 
mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and 
 
shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things 
which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he 
 
saith.  
24  Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye 
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. 
25  And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; 
 
that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your 
trespasses. 
26  But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven 
forgive your trespasses.
