  2067    Matthew 21 
30  And, behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they 
heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O 
Lord, thou Son of David. 
31  And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their 
peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, 
 
thou Son of David. 
32  And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I 
shall do unto you? 
 
33  They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 
34  So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and 
 
immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem 
1  And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to 
Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 
2  saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and 
straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, 
 
and bring them unto me. 
3  And if any man say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need 
of them; and straightway he will send them. 
 
4  All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by 
the prophet, saying, 
5  Tell ye the daughter of Zion, 
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, 
meek, and sitting upon an ass, 
and a colt the foal of an ass.  
6  And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 
7  and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, 
and they set him thereon. 
8  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; 
 
others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the 
way.
