  2292    John 17 
I Have Overcome the World 
25  ¶ These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time 
 
cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I 
shall show you plainly of the Father. 
26  At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I 
 
will pray the Father for you: 
 
27  for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and 
have believed that I came out from God. 
28  I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I 
 
leave the world, and go to the Father. 
29  ¶ His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and 
speakest no proverb. 
30  Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that 
any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth 
 
from God. 
31  Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
 
32  Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be 
scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I 
 
am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
33  These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have 
peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I 
   
have overcome the world.

Jesus’ Prayer for His Disciples 
1  These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, 
Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may 
 
glorify thee: 
 
2  as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give 
eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. 
3  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true 
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
