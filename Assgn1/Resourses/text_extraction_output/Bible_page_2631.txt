  2632    Revelation 11 
3  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall 
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in 
sackcloth. 
4  ¶ These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing 
before the God of the earth.  
5  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, 
and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he 
 
must in this manner be killed. 
6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of 
their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, 
 
and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. 
7  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that 
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, 
and shall overcome them, and kill them. 
8  And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which 
spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was 
crucified. 
9  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall 
see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their 
dead bodies to be put in graves. 
10  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and 
make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two 
 
prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 
11  And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered 
into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon 
 
them which saw them. 
12  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come 
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their 
 
enemies beheld them. 
13  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part 
of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven 
thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the 
 
God of heaven. 
14  ¶ The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh 
 
quickly.
