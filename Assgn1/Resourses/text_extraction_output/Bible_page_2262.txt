  2263    John 7 
22  Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of 
 
Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a 
 
man. 
23  If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of 
Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have 
 
made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? 
 
24  Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous 
judgment. 
Is This the Christ? 
 
25  ¶ Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they 
seek to kill? 
 
26  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the 
rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 
 
27  Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, 
 
no man knoweth whence he is. 
28  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know 
me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he 
 
that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
29  But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
 
30  Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, 
 
because his hour was not yet come. 
31  And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ 
cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath 
done? 
 
Officers Sent to Arrest Jesus 
32  ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things 
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent 
 
officers to take him. 
33  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and 
then I go unto him that sent me.
