  144    Exodus 9 
10  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and 
 
Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking 
 
forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 
11  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the 
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the 
 
Egyptians. 
12  And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened 
not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses. 
 
The Plague of Hail 
13  Â¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, 
and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord 
God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
14  For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and 
upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know 
 
that there is none like me in all the earth. 
15  For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy 
people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
 
16  And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in 
thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all 
 
the earth.  
17  As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let 
them go? 
 
18  Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very 
grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation 
thereof even until now. 
19  Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in 
the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the 
 
field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down 
upon them, and they shall die. 
20  He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of 
Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 
 
21  and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and 
his cattle in the field.
