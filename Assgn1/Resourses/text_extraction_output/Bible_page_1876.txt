  1877    Daniel 3 
4  Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, 
nations, and languages, 
5  that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, 
sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and 
worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set 
up: 
 
6  and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour 
be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
7  Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the 
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the 
people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped 
the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
8  ¶ Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused 
the Jews. 
9  They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for 
ever. 
10  Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear 
the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and 
dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the 
golden image: 
 
11  and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be 
cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
12  There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the 
province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these 
 
men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor 
 
worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
13  ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men 
before the king. 
14  Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego? do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the 
 
golden image which I have set up? 
 
15  Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the 
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of 
music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;
