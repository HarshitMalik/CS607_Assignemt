  1383    Psalms 135 
which by night stand in the house of the Lord. 
2  Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, 
and bless the Lord. 
3  The Lord that made heaven and earth 
bless thee out of Zion. 
135 
The Greatness of the Lord and the Vanity of Idols 
1  Praise ye the Lord. 
Praise ye the name of the Lord; 
 
praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. 
2  Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, 
in the courts of the house of our God, 
3  praise the Lord; 
 
for the Lord is good: 
 
sing praises unto his name; 
 
for it is pleasant. 
4  For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, 
and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
5  For I know that the Lord is great, 
and that our Lord is above all gods. 
6  Whatsoever the Lord pleased, 
that did he in heaven, and in earth, 
in the seas, and all deep places. 
7  He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; 
 
he maketh lightnings for the rain; 
 
he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
8  Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, 
both of man and beast. 
9  Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, 
upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
10  Who smote great nations, 
and slew mighty kings;
