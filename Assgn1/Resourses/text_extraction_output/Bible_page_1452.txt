  1453    Proverbs 28 
28 
The Wicked and the Righteous 
1  The wicked flee when no man pursueth: 
 
but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
2  For the transgression of a land 
many are the princes thereof: 
 
but by a man of understanding and knowledge 
the state thereof shall be prolonged. 
3  A poor man that oppresseth the poor 
is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 
4  They that forsake the law praise the wicked: 
 
but such as keep the law contend with them. 
5  Evil men understand not judgment: 
 
but they that seek the Lord understand all things. 
6  Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, 
than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 
7  Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: 
 
but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. 
8  He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, 
he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 
9  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, 
even his prayer shall be abomination. 
10  Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, 
he shall fall himself into his own pit: 
 
but the upright shall have good things in possession. 
11  The rich man is wise in his own conceit; 
 
but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 
12  When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: 
 
but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 
13  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: 
 
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. 
14  Happy is the man that feareth always: 
 
but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
