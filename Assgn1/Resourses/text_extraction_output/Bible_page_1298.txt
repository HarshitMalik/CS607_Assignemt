  1299    Psalms 74 
11  Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? 
 
Pluck it out of thy bosom. 
12  For God is my King of old, 
working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
13  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:  
 
thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 
14  Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, 
and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 
15  Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: 
 
thou driedst up mighty rivers. 
16  The day is thine, the night also is thine: 
 
thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
17  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: 
 
thou hast made summer and winter. 
18  Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, 
and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 
19  O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the 
wicked: 
 
forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 
20  Have respect unto the covenant: 
 
for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 
21  O let not the oppressed return ashamed: 
 
let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
22  Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: 
 
remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 
23  Forget not the voice of thine enemies: 
 
the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
