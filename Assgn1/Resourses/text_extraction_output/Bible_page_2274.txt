40  and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at 
first baptized; and there he abode. 
 
41  And many resorted unto him and said, John did no miracle: but all 
 
things that John spake of this man were true. 
42  And many believed on him there.

The Death of Lazarus 
1  Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town 
of Mary and her sister Martha.  
2  (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and 
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 
3  Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom 
thou lovest is sick. 
4  When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but 
for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified 
thereby. 
5  Â¶ Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
6  When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days 
still in the same place where he was. 
7  Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again. 
8  His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone 
thee; and goest thou thither again? 
   
9  Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man 
 
walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this 
world. 
10  But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no 
light in him. 
11  These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend 
 
Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 
 
12  Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 
13  Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had 
 
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
