  1684    Jeremiah 32 
Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption 
 
is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the 
 
Lord. 
9  ¶ And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in 
Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of 
silver. 
10  And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, 
and weighed him the money in the balances. 
11  So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed 
according to the law and custom, and that which was open: 
 
12  and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of 
Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s 
son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of 
the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. 
13  And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
14  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these 
 
evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and 
this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, 
 
that they may continue many days. 
15  For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and 
 
fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. 
16  ¶ Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto 
Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord, saying, 
17  Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by 
 
thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too 
hard for thee: 
 
18  thou showest loving-kindness unto thousands, and recompensest 
the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after 
them: The Great, The Mighty God, The Lord of hosts, is his name; 
   
19  great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon 
 
all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his 
ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 
 
20  which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto 
this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a 
 
name, as at this day;
