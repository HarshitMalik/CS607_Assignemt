  539    Joshua 20 
39  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali 
according to their families, the cities and their villages. 
40  ¶ And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan 
according to their families. 
41  And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-
shemesh, 
42  and Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 
43  and Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 
44  and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath, 
45  and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon, 
46  and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho. 
47  And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: 
 
therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and 
took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, 
and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan 
their father.  
48  This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according 
to their families, these cities with their villages. 
49  ¶ When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance 
by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua 
the son of Nun among them: 
 
50  according to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he 
asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, 
 
and dwelt therein. 
51  ¶ These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua 
the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the 
children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before 
the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So 
they made an end of dividing the country.
