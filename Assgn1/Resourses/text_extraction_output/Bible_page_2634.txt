  2635    Revelation 13 
16  And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened her 
 
mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of 
his mouth. 
17  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war 
with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of 
God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
13 
The Two Beasts 
1  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of 
the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten 
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.  
2  And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were 
as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the 
 
dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. 
3  And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his 
 
deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the 
 
beast. 
4  And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: 
 
and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? 
 
who is able to make war with him? 
 
5  Â¶ And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and 
blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and 
 
two months. 
6  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme 
his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 
7  And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to 
overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and 
 
tongues, and nations. 
8  And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names 
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the 
foundation of the world. 
9  If any man have an ear, let him hear.
