  2602    1 John 3 
25  And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 
26  ¶ These things have I written unto you concerning them that 
seduce you. 
27  But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, 
and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing 
 
teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it 
hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 
The Children of God and Righteousness 
28  ¶ And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall 
 
appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at 
his coming. 
29  If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth 
righteousness is born of him. 
3 
1  Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, 
that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world 
 
knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
2  Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear 
what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall 
 
be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 
 
3  And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even 
as he is pure. 
4  ¶ Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is 
 
the transgression of the law. 
5  And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in 
 
him is no sin. 
6  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath 
 
not seen him, neither known him. 
7  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness 
 
is righteous, even as he is righteous.
