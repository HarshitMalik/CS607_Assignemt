  1281    Psalms 64 
10  They shall fall by the sword: 
 
they shall be a portion for foxes. 
11  But the king shall rejoice in God; 
 
every one that sweareth by him shall glory: 
 
but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

A Prayer for Protection from Hidden Enemies 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: 
 
preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
2  Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; 
 
from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
 
3  who whet their tongue like a sword, 
and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 
 
4  that they may shoot in secret at the perfect: 
 
suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
5  They encourage themselves in an evil matter: 
 
they commune of laying snares privily; 
 
they say, Who shall see them? 
 
6  They search out iniquities; 
 
they accomplish a diligent search: 
 
both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 
7  But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; 
 
suddenly shall they be wounded. 
8  So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: 
 
all that see them shall flee away. 
9  And all men shall fear, 
and shall declare the work of God; 
 
for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 
10  The righteous shall be glad in the Lord,
