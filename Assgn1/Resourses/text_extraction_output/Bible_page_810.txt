  811    1 Kings 16 
The Reign of Omri 
21  ¶ Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the 
 
people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and 
 
half followed Omri. 
22  But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that 
followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
 
23  In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign 
over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
 
24  And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, 
and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, 
after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. 
25  ¶ But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse 
than all that were before him. 
26  For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in 
his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God 
of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
27  Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that 
he showed, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of 
the kings of Israel? 
 
28  So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and 
 
Ahab his son reigned in his stead. 
The Reign of Ahab 
29  ¶ And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began 
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of 
 
Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
30  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above 
all that were before him. 
31  And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in 
the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel 
the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served 
Baal, and worshipped him.
