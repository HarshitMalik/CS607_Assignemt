  2505    Philippians 3 
9  and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is 
of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the 
righteousness which is of God by faith: 
 
10  that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the 
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his 
death; 
 
11  if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 
12  ¶ Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: 
 
but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am 
apprehended of Christ Jesus. 
13  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one 
 
thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching 
forth unto those things which are before. 
14  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in 
Christ Jesus. 
15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in 
 
any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto 
you. 
16  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the 
same rule, let us mind the same thing. 
17  ¶ Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which 
walk so as ye have us for an ensample. 
18  (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you 
even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 
 
19  whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is 
in their shame, who mind earthly things.) 
20  For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for 
 
the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
 
21  who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto 
his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even 
to subdue all things unto himself.
