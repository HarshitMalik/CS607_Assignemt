  501    Joshua 4 
4  Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the 
children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
 
5  and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord 
your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of 
you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the 
tribes of the children of Israel: 
 
6  that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask 
their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
 
7  then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off 
before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over 
 
Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be 
 
for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 
8  ¶ And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took 
up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the Lord spake unto 
Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of 
Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they 
lodged, and laid them down there. 
9  And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place 
where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant 
stood: and they are there unto this day. 
 
10  For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, 
until every thing was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to 
speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded 
Joshua. 
¶ And the people hasted and passed over. 
11  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, 
that the ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the 
presence of the people. 
12  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the 
tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, 
as Moses spake unto them: 
 
13  about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord 
unto battle, to the plains of Jericho. 
14  On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; 
 
and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
