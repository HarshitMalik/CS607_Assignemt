  2107    Mark 4 
The Parable of the Growing Seed 
26  ¶ And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast 
seed into the ground; 
 
27  and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring 
and grow up, he knoweth not how. 
28  For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the 
 
ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 
29  But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the 
sickle, because the harvest is come. 
The Parable of the Mustard Seed 
30  ¶ And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or 
 
with what comparison shall we compare it? 
 
31  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the 
earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: 
 
32  but when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all 
herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air 
 
may lodge under the shadow of it. 
Jesus’ Use of Parables 
33  ¶ And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as 
they were able to hear it. 
34  But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were 
 
alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. 
Jesus Calms a Storm 
35  ¶ And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, 
Let us pass over unto the other side. 
36  And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as 
he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
