  2012    Matthew 1 
14  and Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat 
   
Eliud; 
 
15  and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan 
   
begat Jacob; 
 
16  and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born 
Jesus, who is called Christ. 
17  ¶ So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen 
generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon 
 
are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon 
 
unto Christ are fourteen generations. 
The Birth of Jesus Christ 
18  ¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his 
 
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, 
she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 
19  Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to 
make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. 
20  But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord 
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, 
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is 
 
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
21  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: 
 
for he shall save his people from their sins.  
22  Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
23  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, 
and shall bring forth a son, 
and they shall call his name Immanuel,  
which being interpreted is, God with us. 
24  Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord 
had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 
 
25  and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and 
 
he called his name Jesus.
