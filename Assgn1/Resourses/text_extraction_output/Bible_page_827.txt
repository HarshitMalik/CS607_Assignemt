  828    1 Kings 22 
9  Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither 
Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
10  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each 
on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the 
entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied 
 
before them. 
11  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and 
 
he said, Thus saith the Lord, With these shalt thou push the 
Syrians, until thou have consumed them. 
12  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-
gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the king’s 
 
hand. 
13  ¶ And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, 
saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto 
the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the 
 
word of one of them, and speak that which is good. 
14  And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto 
me, that will I speak. 
15  So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall 
we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he 
 
answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into 
 
the hand of the king. 
16  And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee 
that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the 
Lord? 
 
17  And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that 
have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let 
   
them return every man to his house in peace. 
18  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee 
that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
 
19  And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the 
 
Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by 
him on his right hand and on his left.
