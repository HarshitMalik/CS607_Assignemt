  2053    Matthew 15 
18  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from 
the heart; and they defile the man. 
 
19  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, 
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 
 
20  these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen 
 
hands defileth not a man. 
The Canaanite Woman’s Faith 
21  ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and

cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of 
David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
 
23  But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and 
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made 
 
whole from that very hour.

Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
 
30  And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that 
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them 
down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
