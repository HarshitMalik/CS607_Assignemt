  788    1 Kings 9 
3  And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy 
supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this 
 
house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and 
 
mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 
4  And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in 
integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I 
have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my 
judgments; 
 
5  then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, 
as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a 
man upon the throne of Israel.  
6  But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, 
and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have 
set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
 
7  then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; 
 
and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out 
of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all 
 
people: 
 
8  and at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be 
astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord 
 
done thus unto this land, and to this house?  
 
9  And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, 
who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have 
taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and 
served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this 
 
evil. 
Solomon’s Further Activities 
10  ¶ And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon 
had built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the king’s 
house, 
11  (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar 
trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that 
then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
