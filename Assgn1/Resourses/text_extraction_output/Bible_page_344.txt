Laws concerning Offerings 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be 
come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
3  and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, 
or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in 
your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor unto the Lord, of the 
herd, or of the flock: 
 
4  then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat 
offering of a tenth deal of flour, mingled with the fourth part of a 
hin of oil. 
5  And the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou 
prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 
6  Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals 
of flour, mingled with the third part of a hin of oil. 
7  And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of 
wine, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
8  And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a 
sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord; 
 
9  then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth 
deals of flour, mingled with half a hin of oil. 
10  And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine, for an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
11  Â¶ Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a 
lamb, or a kid. 
12  According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to 
every one according to their number. 
13  All that are born of the country shall do these things after this 
manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto 
the Lord.
