  1024    2 Chronicles 26 
meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah 
with thee? 
 
20  ¶ But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might 
 
deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought 
after the gods of Edom. 
21  So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in 
 
the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, 
which belongeth to Judah. 
22  And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every 
man to his tent. 
23  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of 
Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to 
Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of 
Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
24  And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were 
found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of 
the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 
25  ¶ And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death 
of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
26  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they 
not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
 
27  Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the 
Lord they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled 
 
to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there. 
 
28  And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his 
fathers in the city of Judah.

The Reign of Uzziah 
1  Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years 
old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
2  He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept 
with his fathers.
