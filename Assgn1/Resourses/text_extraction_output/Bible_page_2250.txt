  2251    John 4 
14  but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall 
never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a 
 
well of water springing up into everlasting life. 
15  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst 
not, neither come hither to draw. 
16  ¶ Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
17  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto 
her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
 
18  for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not 
 
thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
 
19  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
20  Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in 
 
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
21  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when 
ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the 
Father. 
22  Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship; for 
   
salvation is of the Jews. 
23  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall 
worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh 
 
such to worship him. 
24  God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in 
 
spirit and in truth. 
25  The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is 
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
 
26  Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 
27  ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked 
with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why 
   
talkest thou with her? 
 
28  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, 
and saith to the men, 
29  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not 
 
this the Christ? 
 
30  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 
31  ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
