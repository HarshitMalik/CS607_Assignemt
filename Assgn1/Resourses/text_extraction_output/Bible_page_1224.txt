  1225    Psalms 22 
when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against 
the face of them. 
13  Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: 
 
so will we sing and praise thy power.

A Cry of Anguish and Song of Praise 
To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  
 
Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my 
roaring? 
 
2  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; 
 
and in the night season, and am not silent. 
3  But thou art holy, 
O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
4  Our fathers trusted in thee: 
 
they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
5  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: 
 
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. 
6  But I am a worm, and no man; 
 
a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 
7  All they that see me laugh me to scorn: 
 
they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 
8  He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: 
 
let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.  
9  But thou art he that took me out of the womb: 
 
thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother’s breasts. 
10  I was cast upon thee from the womb: 
 
thou art my God from my mother’s belly. 
11  Be not far from me; for trouble is near; 
   
for there is none to help.
