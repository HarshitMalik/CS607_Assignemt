  474    Deuteronomy 28 
17  Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. 
18  Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, 
and the fruit of thy land, 
the increase of thy kine, 
and the flocks of thy sheep. 
19  Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, 
and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 
20  ¶ The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in 
all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be 
destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness 
 
of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. 
21  The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have 
consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it. 
22  The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, 
and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with 
the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall 
 
pursue thee until thou perish. 
23  And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth 
that is under thee shall be iron. 
24  The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from 
 
heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 
25  ¶ The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: 
 
thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before 
them; and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 
 
26  And thy carcass shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the 
beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away. 
27  The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the 
emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst 
not be healed. 
28  The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and 
astonishment of heart: 
 
29  and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, 
and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only 
 
oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.
