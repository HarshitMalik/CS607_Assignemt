If  problems  remain  intractable  even  after  you  have
severed  entanglements  and  simplified  your  affairs,  just
view  them  objectively.  If  you  are  heavily  afflicted  by
sexuality, then you should view addiction to sex as coming
from thoughts; if those thoughts do not occur, then there is
no  sex.  So  you  should  recognize  that  thoughts  of  sex  are
externally  empty,  while  the  idea  of  sex  is  an  inward
imagination. The imagining mind is empty, so who is the
subject of sexuality?
Scripture says, “Sexual objects are just mental imagery;
since mental images are all empty, how can there be sexual
objects?”
Also, think of how beautiful women are more dangerous
than vixen sprites. Vixen sprites charm men, causing them
aversion, so that they will not enter evil ways, even at the
threat  of  death.  Because  of  this  aversion,  they  avoid
promiscuity forever. Beautiful women bewitch men so that
they  become  obsessed  and  grow  more  and  more  deeply
attached even as it leads to their death. Because of wrong
thoughts,  on  dying  they  fall  into  various  states  and  are
born  in  hell.  Scripture  says,  “In  this  life  you  willed  to
become husband and wife, but after death you cannot live
together.”
Why  is  the  course  of  human  life  like  this?  Because  of
false thoughts.
Also  consider  this:  if  physical  beauty  is  invariably
attractive, why do fish dive and birds fly when they see a
human,  even  a  beautiful  woman?  Wizards  look  upon
