  2356    Acts 17 
The Apostles at Beroea 
10  ¶ And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night 
unto Beroea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the 
 
Jews. 
11  These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they 
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the 
Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
12  Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which 
 
were Greeks, and of men, not a few. 
13  But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of 
God was preached of Paul at Beroea, they came thither also, and 
stirred up the people. 
14  And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were 
to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still. 
 
15  And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and 
 
receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy for to come to 
him with all speed, they departed. 
Paul at Athens 
16  ¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred 
in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 
17  Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the 
devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with 
him. 
18  Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, 
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other 
 
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he 
 
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 
19  And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus [Mars hill. It 
was the highest court in Athens], saying, May we know what this new 
doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? 
 
20  For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would 
 
know therefore what these things mean.
