  644    1 Samuel 12 
Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and 
 
we will serve thee.  
11  And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and 
Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on 
every side, and ye dwelt safe. 
12  And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon 
came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over 
 
us: when the Lord your God was your king. 
 
13  Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom 
ye have desired! and, behold, the Lord hath set a king over you. 
 
14  If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not 
rebel against the commandment of the Lord; then shall both ye 
 
and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the 
Lord your God: 
 
15  but if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the 
commandment of the Lord; then shall the hand of the Lord be 
 
against you, as it was against your fathers. 
16  Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the Lord will 
do before your eyes. 
17  Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call unto the Lord, and he 
 
shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your 
 
wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the Lord, 
in asking you a king. 
18  So Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and 
 
rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the Lord and 
 
Samuel. 
19  Â¶ And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto 
the Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our 
 
sins this evil, to ask us a king. 
20  And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this 
 
wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve 
 
the Lord with all your heart; 
 
21  and turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which 
 
cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
