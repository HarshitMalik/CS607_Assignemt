  2274    John 10 
Jesus Rejected by the Jews 
22  ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was 
winter. 
23  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch. 
24  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How 
long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us 
 
plainly. 
25  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works 
 
that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me. 
26  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto 
you. 
27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 
 
28  and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, 
 
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 
29  My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is 
 
able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand. 
30  I and my Father are one. 
31  ¶ Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
32  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from 
my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
   
33  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; 
 
but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest 
 
thyself God. 
34  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are 
gods? 
 
35  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the 
Scripture cannot be broken; 
 
36  say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the 
world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 
   
37  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
38  But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye 
 
may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. 
39  ¶ Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped out of 
 
their hand,
