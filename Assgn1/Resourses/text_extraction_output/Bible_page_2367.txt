  2368    Acts 21 
16  There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and 
brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with 
whom we should lodge. 
Paul Arrested in the Temple 
17  Â¶ And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us 
gladly. 
18  And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the 
 
elders were present. 
19  And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what 
things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
20  And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, 
Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which 
believe; and they are all zealous of the law: 
   
21  and they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which 
are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought 
not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. 
22  What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for 
   
they will hear that thou art come. 
23  Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which 
 
have a vow on them; 
 
24  them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with 
them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those 
 
things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; 
 
but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. 
25  As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and 
concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep 
themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from 
strangled, and from fornication.  
26  Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with 
them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the 
days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for 
every one of them.
