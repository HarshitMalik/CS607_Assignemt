Results of Justification 
1  Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through 
our Lord Jesus Christ: 
 
2  by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we 
stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
3  And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that 
 
tribulation worketh patience; 
 
4  and patience, experience; and experience, hope: 
   
5  and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed 
 
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 
6  ¶ For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died 
for the ungodly. 
7  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a 
 
good man some would even dare to die. 
8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were 
yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be 
saved from wrath through him. 
10  For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the 
death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by 
 
his life. 
11  And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 
Adam and Christ 
12  ¶ Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death 
by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 
   
13  (for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when 
 
there is no law.
