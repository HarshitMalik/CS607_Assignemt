  2124    Mark 9 
31  For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is 
delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after 
 
that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. 
32  But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
Who Is the Greatest? 
 
33  ¶ And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked 
 
them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? 
 
34  But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among 
 
themselves, who should be the greatest.  
35  And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any 
man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.  
36  And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when 
 
he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 
37  Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, 
receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, 
 
but him that sent me.  
He That Is Not against Us Is for Us 
38  ¶ And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out 
devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him, 
 
because he followeth not us. 
39  But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a 
 
miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. 
40  For he that is not against us is on our part.  
41  For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, 
because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose 
his reward.
