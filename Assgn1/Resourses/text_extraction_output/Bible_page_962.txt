  963    1 Chronicles 26 
19  These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and 
among the sons of Merari. 
20  ¶ And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of 
God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things. 
21  As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite 
 
Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli. 
22  ¶ The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over 
 
the treasures of the house of the Lord. 
23  Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the 
Uzzielites: 
 
24  and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the 
treasures. 
25  And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his 
 
son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son: 
 
26  which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the 
dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the 
captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, 
had dedicated. 
27  Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the 
house of the Lord. 
28  And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner 
the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and 
 
whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of 
Shelomith, and of his brethren. 
29  ¶ Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward 
business over Israel, for officers and judges. 
30  And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valor, a 
thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on 
this side Jordan westward in all the business of the Lord, and in 
the service of the king. 
31  Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the 
Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the 
fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there 
were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
