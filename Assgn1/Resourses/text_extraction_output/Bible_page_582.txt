  583    Judges 11 
17  ¶ Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and 
encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled 
themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. 
18  And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What 
man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? 
 
he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
11 
1  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was 
the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. 
 
2  And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and 
 
they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit 
in our father’s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman. 
 
3  Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of 
Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out 
 
with him. 
4  ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of 
Ammon made war against Israel. 
5  And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against 
Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of 
Tob: 
 
6  and they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we 
may fight with the children of Ammon. 
7  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, 
and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto 
 
me now when ye are in distress? 
 
8  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn 
again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against 
the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of 
Gilead. 
9  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home 
again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord 
deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
