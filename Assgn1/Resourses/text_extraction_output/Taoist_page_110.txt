physical  beauty  as  muck  and  mire;  the  wise  liken  it  to  a
sword or a hatchet.
If you do not eat for seven days you may die, but if you
do  not  have  sexual  intercourse  for  a  hundred  years  you
will avoid premature death. Therefore we know that sex is
not essential for body or mind but is an enemy to essence
and life. Why be obsessed with it, bringing destruction on
yourself?
When  people  see  others  doing  wrong  and  conceive
aversion  and  disdain,  that  is  like  grabbing  the  knife  from
someone about to kill himself and committing suicide with
it  yourself.  It  is  the  other  who  is  doing  wrong,  not
compelling  you;  why  take  on  othersâ€™  wrongs  and  make
them into your own sickness?
Furthermore,  if  you  see  those  who  do  wrong  as
detestable,  then  those  who  do  good  should  also  be
disdained. Why? Because both obstruct the Way.
If  you  are  poor,  you  should  also  look  into  it  carefully.
Who  gave  you  poverty?  Heaven  and  earth  cover  and
support impartially; your present poverty is not on account
of  heaven  and  earth.  When  fathers  and  mothers  produce
children, they want to make them rich and prestigious; so
your present poverty and lowliness are not on account of
your father and mother. People, ghosts, and spirits have no
leisure  even  to  save  themselves;  how  can  they  have  the
power to force poverty on you? Pursue this examination in
activity and in retreat and you will find that poverty comes
from nowhere but your own action.
