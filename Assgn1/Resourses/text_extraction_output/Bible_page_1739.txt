  1740    Lamentations 1 
and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. 
7  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her 
miseries 
all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, 
when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help 
her: 
 
the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths. 
8  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; 
 
therefore she is removed: 
 
all that honored her despise her, 
because they have seen her nakedness: 
 
yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 
9  Her filthiness is in her skirts; 
 
she remembereth not her last end; 
 
therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. 
 
O Lord, behold my affliction: 
 
for the enemy hath magnified himself. 
10  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant 
things: 
 
for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, 
whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy 
congregation. 
11  All her people sigh, they seek bread; 
 
they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: 
 
see, O Lord, and consider; for I am become vile. 
 
12  Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? 
 
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, 
which is done unto me, 
wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. 
13  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, 
and it prevaileth against them: 
 
he hath spread a net for my feet, 
he hath turned me back: 
 
he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. 
14  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand:
