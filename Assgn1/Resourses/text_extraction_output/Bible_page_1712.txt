  1713    Jeremiah 44 
multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in 
Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
16  As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the 
Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. 
17  But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our 
own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour 
out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, 
our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets

curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 
23  Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned 
against the Lord, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, nor 
walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; 
 
therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. 
24  ¶ Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the 
women, Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah that are in the land 
of Egypt:
