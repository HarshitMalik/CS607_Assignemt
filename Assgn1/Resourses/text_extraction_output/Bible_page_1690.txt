  1691    Jeremiah 34 
14  At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother a Hebrew, 
which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six 
 
years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers 
 
hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. 
15  And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in 
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a 
 
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 
 
16  but ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his 
servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty 
at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be 
unto you for servants and for handmaids. 
17  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not hearkened unto me, 
 
in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to 
his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, 
 
to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make 
 
you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 
18  And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which 
have not performed the words of the covenant which they had 
made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed 
between the parts thereof, 
19  the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, 
and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed 
between the parts of the calf; 
 
20  I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the 
hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for 
 
meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
21  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the 
hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their 
life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are 
gone up from you. 
22  Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and cause them to return 
to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it 
 
with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without 
 
an inhabitant.
