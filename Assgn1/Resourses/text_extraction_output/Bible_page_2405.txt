  2406    Romans 8 
24  For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for 
   
what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 
 
25  But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for 
it. 
26  ¶ Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not 
 
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh 
 
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 
27  And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the 
Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to 
the will of God. 
More than Conquerors 
28  ¶ And we know that all things work together for good to them that 
love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. 
29  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be 
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn 
among many brethren. 
30  Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and 
 
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, 
 
them he also glorified. 
31  ¶ What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can 
 
be against us? 
 
32  He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, 
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 
 
33  Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that 
 
justifieth. 
34  Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is 
 
risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh 
intercession for us. 
35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or 
 
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or 
sword? 
 
36  As it is written, 
For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
