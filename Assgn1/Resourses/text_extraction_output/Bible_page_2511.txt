  2512    Colossians 3 
20  ¶ Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the 
world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to 
ordinances, 
21  (touch not; taste not; handle not; 
     
22  which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments 
 
and doctrines of men? 
 
23  which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and 
humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor to the 
 
satisfying of the flesh. 
3 
1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, 
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.  
2  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
4  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear 
with him in glory. 
The Old Life and the New 
5  ¶ Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; 
 
fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, 
and covetousness, which is idolatry: 
 
6  for which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of 
disobedience: 
 
7  in the which ye also walked sometime, when ye lived in them. 
8  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, 
 
filthy communication out of your mouth. 
9  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with 
his deeds; 
 
10  and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after 
the image of him that created him:
