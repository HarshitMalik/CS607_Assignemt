  721    2 Samuel 13 
27  And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against 
Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 
28  Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp 
against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after 
 
my name. 
29  And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, 
and fought against it, and took it. 
30  And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight 
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set 
 
on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great 
abundance. 
31  And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them 
under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and 
made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the 
 
cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people 
returned unto Jerusalem.

Amnon and Tamar 
1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a 
fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David 
 
loved her. 
2  And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for 
 
she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any 
 
thing to her. 
3  But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of 
Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtile man. 
 
4  And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean 
from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, 
   
I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister. 
5  And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make 
thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him,
