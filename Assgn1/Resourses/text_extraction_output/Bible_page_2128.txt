  2129    Mark 11 
44  and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  
45  For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to 
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
Blind Bartimeus Receives Sight 
46  Â¶ And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his 
 
disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of 
Timeus, sat by the highway side begging. 
47  And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry 
out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 
48  And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried 
 
the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 
49  And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they 
call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he 
 
calleth thee. 
50  And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 
51  And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I 
should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I 
 
might receive my sight. 
52  And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee 
 
whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus 
in the way.

The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem 
1  And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and 
Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his 
disciples, 
2  and saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: 
 
and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, 
whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
