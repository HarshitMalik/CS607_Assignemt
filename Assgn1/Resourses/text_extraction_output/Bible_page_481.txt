  482    Deuteronomy 31 
13  Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go 
over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do 
it? 
 
14  But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, 
that thou mayest do it.  
15  ¶ See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and 
evil; 
 
16  in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk 
in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and 
his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord 
 
thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. 
17  But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be 
drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
 
18  I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye 
shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest 
over Jordan to go to possess it. 
19  I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set 
before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose 
 
life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 
 
20  that thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest 
obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy 
 
life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land 
 
which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and 
to Jacob, to give them.

Joshua Commissioned as Moses’ Successor 
1  And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
2  And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this 
day; I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord hath said 
   
unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
