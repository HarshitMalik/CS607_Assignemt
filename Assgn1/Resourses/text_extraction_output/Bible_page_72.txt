  73    Genesis 31 
31 
1  And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken 
away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s 
 
hath he gotten all this glory. 
2  And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was 
not toward him as before. 
3  And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, 
and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 
 
4  And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his 
flock, 
5  and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not 
toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 
 
6  And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
7  And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten 
times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
 
8  If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle 
 
bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy 
 
hire; then bare all the cattle ring-streaked. 
 
9  Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them 
to me. 
10  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I 
lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams 
which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and 
grizzled. 
11  And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: and 
 
I said, Here am I. 
12  And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which 
leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I 
 
have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 
13  I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and 
where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from 
 
this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 
14  And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any 
portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
