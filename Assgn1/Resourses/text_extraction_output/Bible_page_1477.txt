  1478    Ecclesiastes 12 
8  but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him 
 
remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that 
 
cometh is vanity. 
Advice to the Young 
9  Â¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee 
 
in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in 
the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God 
 
will bring thee into judgment. 
10  Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from 
thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. 
 
12 
1  Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil 
days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have 
no pleasure in them; 
 
2  while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not 
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 
 
3  in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the 
strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because 
they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, 
4  and the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the 
grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all 
the daughters of music shall be brought low; 
 
5  also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be 
in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper 
shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his 
 
long home, and the mourners go about the streets: 
 
6  or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or 
the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the 
cistern. 
7  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall 
 
return unto God who gave it.
