  2295    John 18 
6  As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went 
backward, and fell to the ground. 
7  Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of 
 
Nazareth. 
8  Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek 
 
me, let these go their way: 
 
9  that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which 
thou gavest me have I lost none. 
10  Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high 
priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was 
Malchus. 
11  Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the 
 
cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? 
 
Jesus Brought before the High Priest 
12  ¶ Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, 
and bound him, 
13  and led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to 
 
Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. 
14  Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was 
expedient that one man should die for the people.  
Peter in the High Priest’s Court 
15  ¶ And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that 
 
disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus 
into the palace of the high priest. 
16  But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other 
disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto 
her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
17  Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou 
also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.
