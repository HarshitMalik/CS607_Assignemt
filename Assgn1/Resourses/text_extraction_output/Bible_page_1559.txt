  1560    Isaiah 39 
18  For the grave cannot praise thee, 
death cannot celebrate thee: 
 
they that go down into the pit 
cannot hope for thy truth. 
19  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, 
as I do this day: 
 
the father to the children 
shall make known thy truth. 
20  The Lord was ready to save me: 
 
therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments 
all the days of our life in the house of the Lord. 
21  Â¶ For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a 
plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover. 
22  Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the 
house of the Lord?

Hezekiah Receives Envoys from Babylon 
1  At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of 
Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard 
 
that he had been sick, and was recovered. 
2  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his 
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the 
precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was 
found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his 
 
dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. 
3  Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto 
him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? 
   
And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, 
even from Babylon. 
4  Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah 
 
answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing 
 
among my treasures that I have not showed them.
