THE YOGA OF THE DESPONDENCY OF ARJUNA
Aachaaryam upasamgamya raajaa vachanam abraveet.
Sanjaya said:
2. Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana then
approached his teacher (Drona) and spoke these words:
Pashyaitaam paanduputraanaam aachaarya mahateem chamoom;
Vyoodhaam drupadaputrena tava shishyena dheemataa.
3. “Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of
Drupada, thy wise disciple!
Atra shooraa maheshwaasaa bheemaarjunasamaa yudhi;
Yuyudhaano viraatashcha drupadashcha mahaarathah.
4. “Here are heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhima and Arjuna, Yuyudhana,
Virata and Drupada, of the great car (mighty warriors),
Dhrishtaketush chekitaanah kaashiraajashcha veeryavaan;
Purujit kuntibhojashcha shaibyashcha narapungavah.
5. “Drishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, and Kuntibhoja and Saibya,
the best of men,
Yudhaamanyushcha vikraanta uttamaujaashcha veeryavaan;
Saubhadro draupadeyaashcha sarva eva mahaarathaah.
6. “The strong Yudhamanyu and the brave Uttamaujas, the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu,
the son of Arjuna), and the sons of Draupadi, all of great chariots (great heroes).
Asmaakam tu vishishtaa ye taan nibodha dwijottama;
Naayakaah mama sainyasya samjnaartham taan braveemi te.
7. “Know also, O best among the twice-born, the names of those who are the most
distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army! These I name to thee for thy information.
Bhavaan bheeshmashcha karnashcha kripashcha samitinjayah;
Ashwatthaamaa vikarnashcha saumadattis tathaiva cha.
8. “Thyself and Bhishma, and Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war; Asvatthama, Vikarna,
and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta.
Anye cha bahavah shooraa madarthe tyaktajeevitaah;
Naanaashastrapraharanaah sarve yuddhavishaaradaah.
