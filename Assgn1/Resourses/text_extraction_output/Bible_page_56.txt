  57    Genesis 25 
The Descendants of Ishmael 
12  ¶ Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom 
Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
 
13  and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, 
according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; 
   
and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
14  and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
15  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
 
16  these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their 
towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their 
 
nations. 
17  And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty 
and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died, and was 
 
gathered unto his people. 
18  And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as 
thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his 
 
brethren. 
The Birth of Esau and Jacob 
19  ¶ And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham 
 
begat Isaac: 
 
20  and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the 
daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban 
the Syrian. 
21  And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: 
 
and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife 
conceived. 
22  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be 
 
so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the Lord. 
 
23  And the Lord said unto her, 
Two nations are in thy womb, 
and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; 
 
and the one people shall be stronger than the other people;
