  1484    Song of Solomon 4 
threescore valiant men are about it, 
of the valiant of Israel. 
8  They all hold swords, 
being expert in war: 
 
every man hath his sword upon his thigh 
because of fear in the night. 
9  King Solomon made himself a chariot 
of the wood of Lebanon. 
10  He made the pillars thereof of silver, 
the bottom thereof of gold, 
the covering of it of purple, 
the midst thereof being paved with love, 
for the daughters of Jerusalem. 
11  Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon 
with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him 
in the day of his espousals, 
and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

The Bridegroom Praises the Bride 
1  Behold, thou art fair, my love; 
 
behold, thou art fair; 
 
thou hast dovesâ€™ eyes within thy locks: 
 
thy hair is as a flock of goats, 
that appear from mount Gilead. 
2  Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, 
which came up from the washing; 
 
whereof every one bear twins, 
and none is barren among them. 
3  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, 
and thy speech is comely: 
 
thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 
4  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory,
