Elisha Succeeds Elijah 
1  And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into 
heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 
2  And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord 
 
hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord 
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went 
down to Beth-el. 
3  And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to 
Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take 
away thy master from thy head today? And he said, Yea, I know it; 
   
hold ye your peace. 
4  ¶ And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
 
Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, 
and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. 
5  And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, 
and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy 
master from thy head today? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold 
   
ye your peace. 
6  ¶ And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord 
 
hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy 
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. 
7  And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view 
afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 
 
8  And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the 
waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two 
went over on dry ground. 
9  ¶ And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said 
unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away 
from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy 
spirit be upon me.
