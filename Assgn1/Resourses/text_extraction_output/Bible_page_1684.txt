  1685    Jeremiah 32 
21  and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt 
with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a 
stretched out arm, and with great terror; 
 
22  and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their 
fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
 
23  and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, 
 
neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou 
 
commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to 
 
come upon them. 
24  Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the 
 
city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, 
because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and 
 
what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. 
 
25  And thou hast said unto me, O Lord God, Buy thee the field for 
money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the 
 
Chaldeans. 
26  Â¶ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, 
27  Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too 
 
hard for me? 
 
28  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this city into the 
 
hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king 
of Babylon, and he shall take it:  
 
29  and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set 
fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they 
have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings 
unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
30  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done 
evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only 
 
provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the 
Lord. 
31  For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of 
my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day, that I 
should remove it from before my face; 
 
32  because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of 
Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their
