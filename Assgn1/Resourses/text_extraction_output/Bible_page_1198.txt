  1199    Job 42 
23  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: 
 
they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 
 
24  His heart is as firm as a stone; 
 
yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 
25  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: 
 
by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
26  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: 
 
the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
27  He esteemeth iron as straw, 
and brass as rotten wood. 
28  The arrow cannot make him flee: 
 
sling stones are turned with him into stubble. 
29  Darts are counted as stubble: 
 
he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
30  Sharp stones are under him: 
 
he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
31  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: 
 
he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
32  He maketh a path to shine after him; 
 
one would think the deep to be hoary. 
33  Upon earth there is not his like, 
who is made without fear. 
34  He beholdeth all high things: 
 
he is a king over all the children of pride.

Jobâ€™s Confession and Acceptance 
1  Then Job answered the Lord, and said, 
2  I know that thou canst do every thing, 
and that no thought can be withholden from thee. 
3  Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?  
 
Therefore have I uttered that I understood not; 
 
things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
