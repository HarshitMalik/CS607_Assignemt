  994    2 Chronicles 11 
14  and answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My 
father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father 
 
chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
15  So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of 
 
God, that the Lord might perform his word, which he spake by 
the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
16  Â¶ And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto 
them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we 
in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every 
   
man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own 
 
house. So all Israel went to their tents. 
17  But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, 
Rehoboam reigned over them. 
18  Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and 
 
the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king 
Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to 
Jerusalem. 
19  And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
11 
1  And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the 
house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand 
chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he 
might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
2  But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God, 
saying, 
3  Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to 
all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
4  Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your 
brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is done of 
   
me. And they obeyed the words of the Lord, and returned from 
going against Jeroboam.
