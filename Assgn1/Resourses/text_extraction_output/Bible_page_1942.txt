  1943    Amos 9 
The Future Restoration of Israel 
11  ¶ In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, 
and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and 
 
I will build it as in the days of old: 
 
12  that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, 
which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doeth this.  
13  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall 
overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth 
seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills 
 
shall melt. 
14  And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they 
shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant 
 
vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make 
 
gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
15  And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be 
pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the 
Lord thy God.
