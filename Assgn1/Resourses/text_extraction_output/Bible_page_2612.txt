  2613    Jude 1 
9  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he 
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a 
railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.  
10  But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what 
 
they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt 
themselves. 
11  Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran 
 
greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the 
gainsaying of Korah.

13  raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering 
 
stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. 
14  ¶ And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, 
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 
15  to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly 
among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly 
committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners 
have spoken against him. 
16  These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; 
 
and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s 
persons in admiration because of advantage. 
Warnings and Exhortations 
17  ¶ But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before 
of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
 
18  how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, 
who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.  
19  These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the 
Spirit. 
20  But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, 
praying in the Holy Ghost,
