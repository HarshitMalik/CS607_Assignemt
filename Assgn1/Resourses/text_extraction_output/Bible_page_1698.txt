  1699    Jeremiah 38 
38 
Jeremiah Rescued from the Dungeon 
1  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of 
Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of 
Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the 
people, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the 
sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth 
 
to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and 
 
shall live. 
3  Thus saith the Lord, This city shall surely be given into the hand 
of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it. 
4  Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this 
man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men 
 
of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in 
speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the 
 
welfare of this people, but the hurt. 
5  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the 
 
king is not he that can do any thing against you. 
6  Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of 
Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the 
prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the 
 
dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the 
 
mire. 
7  ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs 
which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in 
the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 
   
8  Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the 
king, saying, 
9  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have 
done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the 
dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: 
   
for there is no more bread in the city.
