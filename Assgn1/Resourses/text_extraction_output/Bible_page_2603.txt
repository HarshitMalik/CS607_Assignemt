  2604    1 John 4 
22  And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his 
commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 
23  And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name 
of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us 
commandment.  
24  And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he 
in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit 
which he hath given us.

The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Antichrist 
1  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they 
are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the 
 
world. 
2  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that 
 
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
 
3  and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the 
flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye 
 
have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the 
 
world. 
4  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because 
 
greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
5  They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the 
 
world heareth them. 
6  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of 
   
God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the 
spirit of error. 
God Is Love 
7  Â¶ Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one 
   
that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 
8  He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.
