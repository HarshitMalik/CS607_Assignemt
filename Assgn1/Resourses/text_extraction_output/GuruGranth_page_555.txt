As long as there is breath in the body, he does not remember God; what will he do 
when he goes beyond? One who remembers the Lord is spiritually wise; the ignorant 
act blindly. O Nanak, whatever one does in this world determines what he shall receive 
in the world beyond.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  It is the pre-ordained Command of the 
Lord and Master, that one cannot be conscious of Him without the True Guru. Meeting 
the True Guru, one realizes that the Lord is permeating and pervading deep within; he 
remains forever absorbed in the Lord‟s Love. With each and every breath, he constantly 
remembers the Lord in meditation; not a single breath passes in vain. The fear of birth 
and death departs, and one obtains the honored state of eternal life. O Nanak, this rank 
is bestowed  upon  those whom He showers with  His Mercy.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He 
Himself is all-wise and all-knowing; He Himself is supreme. He Himself reveals His form, 
and He Himself enjoins us to His meditation. He Himself poses as a silent sage, and He 
Himself speaks spiritual wisdom. He does not seem bitter to anyone; He is pleasing to 
all. His Praises cannot be described; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him.  || 19 ||   
SHALOK,  FIRST MEHL:  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, the Jinn, the demons, 
have taken birth. The son is a demon, the daughter is a demon, and the wife is the 
chief of the demons.  || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL:  The Hindus have forgotten the Primal Lord; 
they are going the wrong way. As Naarad instructed them, they worship idols. They are 
blind and mute, the blindest of the blind. The ignorant fools pick up stones and worship 
them. But when those stones themselves sink, how will they carry you across?  || 2 ||   
PAUREE:  Everything is in Your power; You are the True King. The devotees are attuned 
to the Love of the One Lord; they have perfect faith in Him. The Name of the Lord is 
the  food  of  ambrosial  nectar;  His  humble  servants  eat  their  fill.  All  treasures  are 
obtained — meditative remembrance is the true profit. The Saints are very dear to the 
Supreme Lord God; O Nanak, the Lord is unapproachable and unfathomable.  || 20 ||   
SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Everything comes by His Command, and everything goes by 
His Command. If some fool believes that he does so himself, he is blind, and acts in 
blindness. O Nanak, one who becomes Gurmukh understands the Hukam of the Lord‟s 
Command; the Lord grants His Grace.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  He alone is a Yogi, and 
he alone finds the Way, who as Gurmukh, has found the Naam. In the body-village of 
that Yogi is everything; Yoga is not obtained by outward show and religious robes. O 
Nanak, such a Yogi is very rare; the Lord is revealed in the heart.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  He 
Himself created the creatures, and He Himself supports them. He Himself is seen to be 
subtle, and He Himself is obvious. He Himself remains a solitary hermit, and He Himself 
has a huge family. Nanak begs for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints of the 
Lord. I cannot see any other Giver; You alone are the Giver, Lord.  || 21 || 1 ||  SUDH
