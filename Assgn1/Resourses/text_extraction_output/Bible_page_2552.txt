  2553    Hebrews 3 
16  For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on

people. 
18  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to 
succor them that are tempted.

Christ Superior to Moses 
1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, 
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ 
Jesus; 
 
2  who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was

3  For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, 
inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than 
the house. 
4  For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things 
 
is God. 
5  And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a 
testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
 
6  but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we 
 
hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the 
end. 
A Rest for the People of God

in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
