  1404    Proverbs 2 
but they shall not find me: 
 
29  for that they hated knowledge, 
and did not choose the fear of the Lord: 
 
30  they would none of my counsel: 
 
they despised all my reproof. 
31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, 
and be filled with their own devices. 
32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, 
and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 
33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, 
and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

The Reward of Seeking Wisdom 
1  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, 
and hide my commandments with thee; 
 
2  so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, 
and apply thine heart to understanding; 
 
3  yea, if thou criest after knowledge, 
and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 
 
4  if thou seekest her as silver, 
and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 
 
5  then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, 
and find the knowledge of God. 
6  For the Lord giveth wisdom: 
 
out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 
7  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: 
 
he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 
8  He keepeth the paths of judgment, 
and preserveth the way of his saints. 
9  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, 
and judgment, and equity; 
 
yea, every good path.
