26  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that 
ye had heard that he had been sick. 
27  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on

28  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him 
again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
29  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such 
 
in reputation: 
 
30  because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not 
regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

righteousness which is in the law, blameless. 
7  But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 
8  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of 
the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered 
 
the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win 
Christ,
