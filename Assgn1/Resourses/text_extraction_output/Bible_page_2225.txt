The Widow’s Offering 
1  And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the 
treasury. 
2  And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. 
3  And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath 
cast in more than they all: 
 
4  for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of 
God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. 
 
The Destruction of the Temple and Signs before the End 
5  ¶ And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly 
stones and gifts, he said, 
6  As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the 
which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not 
be thrown down. 
7  And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things 
be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to 
 
pass? 
 
8  And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall 
 
come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: 
   
go ye not therefore after them. 
9  But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: 
 
for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and 
 
by. 
10  ¶ Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and 
kingdom against kingdom: 
 
11  and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and 
pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from 
 
heaven.
