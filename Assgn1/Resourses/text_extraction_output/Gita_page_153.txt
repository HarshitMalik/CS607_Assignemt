THE YOGA OF LIBERATION BY RENUNCIATION
Raajan samsmritya samsmritya samvaadam imam adbhutam;
Keshavaarjunayoh punyam hrishyaami cha muhurmuhuh.
76. O King, remembering this wonderful and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I
rejoice again and again!
Taccha samsmritya samsmritya roopamatyadbhutam hareh;
Vismayo me mahaan raajan hrishyaami cha punah punah.
77. And remembering again and again also that most wonderful form of Hari, great is my
wonder, O King! And I rejoice again and again!
Yatra yogeshwarah krishno yatra paartho dhanurdharah;
Tatra shreervijayo bhootirdhruvaa neetirmatirmama.
78. Wherever there is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, wherever there is Arjuna, the archer, there
are prosperity, happiness, victory and firm policy; such is my conviction.
Hari Om Tat Sat
Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam
Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade
Mokshasannyaasayogo Naama Ashtaadasho’dhyaayah
Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the eighteenth discourse
entitled:
“The Yoga of Liberation by Renunciation”
Om Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!
