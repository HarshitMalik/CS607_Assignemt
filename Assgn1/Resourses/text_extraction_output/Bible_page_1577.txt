  1578    Isaiah 48 
10  ¶ For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None 
 
seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; 
 
and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else besides me. 
11  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from 
 
whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not 
   
be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, 
 
which thou shalt not know. 
12  ¶ Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of 
thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be 
 
thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 
13  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the 
astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, 
and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. 
14  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall 
   
not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not 
 
be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. 
15  Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast labored, even thy 
merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his 
 
quarter; none shall save thee.

Israel’s Unfaithfulness Rebuked 
1  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of 
Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear 
by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, 
but not in truth, nor in righteousness. 
2  For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon 
the God of Israel: The Lord of hosts is his name. 
 
3  ¶ I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they 
 
went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them 
 
suddenly, and they came to pass. 
4  Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron 
sinew, and thy brow brass;
