  981    2 Chronicles 5 
5  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, 
these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 
6  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were 
assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, 
which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
7  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord 
unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, 
even under the wings of the cherubim: 
 
8  for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, 
and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
9  And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves 
were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen 
 
without. And there it is unto this day. 
10  There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put 
therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children 
of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. 
11  And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did 
 
not then wait by course: 
 
12  also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of 
Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being 
arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, 
stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and 
twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 
 
13  it came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to 
make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; 
 
and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals 
and instruments of music, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is 
good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled 
   
with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; 
 
14  so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the 
cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.
