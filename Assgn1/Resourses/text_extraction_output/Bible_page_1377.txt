  1378    Psalms 128 
to eat the bread of sorrows: 
 
for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 
3  Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord: 
 
and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 
4  As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; 
 
so are children of the youth. 
5  Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: 
 
they shall not be ashamed, 
but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 
128 
The Blessedness of Him Who Fears the Lord 
A Song of degrees. 
1  Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; 
 
that walketh in his ways. 
2  For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands: 
 
happy shalt thou be, 
and it shall be well with thee. 
3  Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine 
by the sides of thine house: 
 
thy children like olive plants 
round about thy table. 
4  Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. 
5  The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: 
 
and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem 
all the days of thy life. 
6  Yea, thou shalt see thy childrenâ€™s children, 
and peace upon Israel.
