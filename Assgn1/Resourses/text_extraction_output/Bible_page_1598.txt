  1599    Isaiah 60 
8  Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their 
windows? 
 
9  Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to 
bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto 
the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, 
because he hath glorified thee. 
10  ¶ And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings 
shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my 
 
favor have I had mercy on thee. 
11  Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be 
 
shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the 
 
Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. 
12  For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; 
 
yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. 
13  The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine 
tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; 
 
and I will make the place of my feet glorious. 
14  The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto 
thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at 
 
the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, 
 
The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 
15  ¶ Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went 
through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many 
generations. 
16  Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the 
breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy 
 
Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. 
17  For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for 
wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, 
 
and thine exactors righteousness. 
18  Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor 
destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls 
 
Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
