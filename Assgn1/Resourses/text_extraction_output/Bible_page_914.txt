  915    1 Chronicles 5 
The History of the Two and a Half Tribes 
18  ¶ The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of 
Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and 
to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand 
seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. 
19  And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, 
and Nodab. 
20  And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were 
delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they 
 
cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them; because 
 
they put their trust in him. 
21  And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and 
 
of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two 
thousand, and of men a hundred thousand. 
22  For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And 
they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 
23  ¶ And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: 
 
they increased from Bashan unto Baal-hermon and Senir, and unto 
mount Hermon. 
24  And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, 
and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and 
Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of the house 
of their fathers. 
25  And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a 
whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God 
destroyed before them. 
26  And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, 
and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried 
them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe 
of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, 
and to the river Gozan, unto this day.
