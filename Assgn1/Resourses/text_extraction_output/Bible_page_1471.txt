  1472    Ecclesiastes 7 
15  ¶ All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man 
 
that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that 
prolongeth his life in his wickedness. 
16  Be not righteous over much, neither make thyself over wise: why 
 
shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
 
17  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest 
 
thou die before thy time? 
 
18  It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this 
 
withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth 
 
of them all. 
19  ¶ Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men 
which are in the city. 
20  ¶ For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and 
sinneth not. 
21  ¶ Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear 
 
thy servant curse thee: 
 
22  for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself 
likewise hast cursed others. 
23  ¶ All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was 
   
far from me. 
24  That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 
 
25  I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out 
wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of 
folly, even of foolishness and madness: 
 
26  and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares 
and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape 
 
from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 
 
27  Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, counting one by one, 
to find out the account; 
 
28  which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a 
 
thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not 
 
found. 
29  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but 
 
they have sought out many inventions.
