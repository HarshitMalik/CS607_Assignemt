  2232    Luke 22 
42  saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: 
 
nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done. 
43  And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening 
him. 
44  And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was 
 
as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
45  And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he 
found them sleeping for sorrow, 
46  and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into 
 
temptation. 
The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus 
47  ¶ And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was 
called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near 
unto Jesus to kiss him. 
48  But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with 
a kiss? 
 
49  When they which were about him saw what would follow, they 
said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
 
50  And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off 
his right ear. 
51  And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his 
ear, and healed him. 
52  Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, 
and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against 
a thief, with swords and staves? 
 
53  When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no 
hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. 
 
Peter Denies Jesus 
54  ¶ Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high 
priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.
