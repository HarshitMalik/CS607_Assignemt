  49    Genesis 23 
20  ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, 
saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy 
brother Nahor; 
 
21  Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of 
Aram, 
22  and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
23  And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, 
 
Abraham’s brother. 
24  And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, 
and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

5  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
6  Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice

thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
7  And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the 
land, even to the children of Heth. 
8  And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
