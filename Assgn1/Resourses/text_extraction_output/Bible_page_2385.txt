  2386    Acts 28 
The Shipwreck 
39  ¶ And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they 
 
discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were 
minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. 
40  And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed 
themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up 
the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. 
41  And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship 
aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but 
 
the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 
42  And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them 
should swim out, and escape. 
43  But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their 
purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast 
 
themselves first into the sea, and get to land: 
 
44  and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. 
And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

Paul on the Island of Melita 
1  And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was 
called Melita. 
2  And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they 
 
kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present 
rain, and because of the cold. 
3  And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on 
the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his 
hand. 
4  And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, 
they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, 
whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not 
to live.
