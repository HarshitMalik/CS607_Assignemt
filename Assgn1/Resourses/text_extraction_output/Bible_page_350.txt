  351    Numbers 16 
33  They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, 
and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the 
 
congregation. 
34  And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: 
 
for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also. 
35  And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two 
hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 
36  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
37  Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the 
censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for 
 
they are hallowed. 
38  The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make 
them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them 
 
before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a 
 
sign unto the children of Israel. 
39  And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that 
were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a 
 
covering of the altar: 
 
40  to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which 
is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the 
Lord; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the Lord 
   
said to him by the hand of Moses. 
41  ¶ But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel 
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed 
the people of the Lord. 
42  And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against 
Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of 
the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory 
 
of the Lord appeared. 
43  And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
44  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
45  Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume 
them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
