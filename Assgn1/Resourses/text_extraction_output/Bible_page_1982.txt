  1983    Zechariah 1 
9  Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked 
 
with me said unto me, I will show thee what these be. 
10  And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, 
These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro 
through the earth. 
11  And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the 
myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the 
earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. 
12  Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of hosts, 
how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities 
of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore 
and ten years? 
 
13  And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good 
words and comfortable words. 
14  So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, 
saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem 
 
and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
15  And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for 
 
I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. 
16  Therefore thus saith the Lord; I am returned to Jerusalem with 
 
mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and 
 
a line shall be stretched upon Jerusalem. 
17  Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through 
 
prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet 
 
comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. 
The Vision of the Horns and Carpenters 
18  Â¶ Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
19  And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And 
 
he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, 
Israel, and Jerusalem. 
20  And the Lord showed me four carpenters. 
21  Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These 
 
are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up
