  2325    Acts 7 
35  ¶ This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler 
and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by 
 
the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. 
36  He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs 
in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty 
years.  
37  This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A 
Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your 
brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  
 
38  This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel 
which spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who 
 
received the lively oracles to give unto us: 
 
39  to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, 
and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, 
40  saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this 
 
Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what 
is become of him.  
41  And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the 
idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  
42  Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; 
 
as it is written in the book of the prophets, 
O ye house of Israel, 
have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices 
by the space of forty years in the wilderness? 
 
43  Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, 
and the star of your god Remphan, 
figures which ye made to worship them: 
 
and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  
44  ¶ Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he 
had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it 
according to the fashion that he had seen.  
45  Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into 
the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face 
of our fathers, unto the days of David;
