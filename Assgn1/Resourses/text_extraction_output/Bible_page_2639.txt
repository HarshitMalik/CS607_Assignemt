  2640    Revelation 16 
3  ¶ And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it 
 
became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the 
 
sea. 
4  ¶ And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and 
fountains of waters; and they became blood.  
 
5  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, 
which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. 
6  For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast 
given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. 
 
7  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God 
Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. 
8  ¶ And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power 
 
was given unto him to scorch men with fire. 
9  And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name 
of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented 
 
not to give him glory. 
10  ¶ And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; 
 
and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their 
 
tongues for pain, 
11  and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their 
sores, and repented not of their deeds. 
12  ¶ And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river 
Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the 
 
kings of the east might be prepared.  
13  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of 
the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the 
mouth of the false prophet. 
14  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth 
unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them 
to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 
15  Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth 
his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 
16  And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew 
tongue Armageddon.
