  573    Judges 8 
19  ¶ So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto 
the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and 
 
they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and 
 
brake the pitchers that were in their hands. 
20  And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the 
pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in 
their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the 
 
Lord, and of Gideon. 
21  And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and 
 
all the host ran, and cried, and fled. 
22  And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord set every 
man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and 
 
the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel-
meholah, unto Tabbath. 
23  And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of 
Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued 
after the Midianites. 
24  ¶ And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, 
saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them 
the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of 
Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto 
Beth-barah and Jordan. 
25  And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and 
 
they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the 
winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of 
Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

1  And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us 
thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the 
Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
