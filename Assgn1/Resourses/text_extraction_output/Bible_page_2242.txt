  2243    John 1 
16  And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. 
17  For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus 
Christ. 
18  No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which 
 
is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. 
The Testimony of John the Baptist 
19  ¶ And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and 
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 
 
20  And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the 
 
Christ. 
21  And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I 
   
am not. Art thou that Prophet? And he answered, No. 
 
22  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an 
 
answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 
 
23  He said, I am 
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
Make straight the way of the Lord, 
as said the prophet Isaiah.  
24  ¶ And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 
25  And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, 
if thou be not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that Prophet? 
 
26  John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there 
 
standeth one among you, whom ye know not; 
 
27  he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose 
shoelatchet I am not worthy to unloose. 
28  These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John 
was baptizing. 
Behold the Lamb of God 
29  ¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, 
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!
