If it pleases You, then save me, True Lord. Nanak places the hopes of his mind in You 
alone, O greatest of the great!  || 33 || 1 ||  SUDH  ||    
GAUREE KEE VAAR, FIFTH MEHL: SUNG TO THE TUNE OF VAAR OF 
RAA-I KAMAALDEE-MOJADEE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
 
SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Auspicious and approved is the birth of that humble being who 
chants  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har.  I  am  a  sacrifice  to  that  humble  being  who 
vibrates and meditates on God, the Lord of Nirvaanaa. The pains of birth and death are 
eradicated, upon meeting the All-knowing Lord, the Primal Being. In the Society of the 
Saints,  he  crosses over  the world-ocean; O  servant Nanak, he has the strength  and 
support of the True Lord.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  I rise up in the early morning hours, 
and the Holy Guest comes into my home. I wash His feet; He is always pleasing to my 
mind and body. I hear the Naam, and I gather in the Naam; I am lovingly attuned to 
the Naam. My home and wealth are totally sanctified as I sing the Glorious Praises of 
the Lord. The Trader in the Lord‟s Name, O Nanak, is found by great good fortune.  || 2 
||   PAUREE:  Whatever pleases You is good; True is the Pleasure of Your Will. You are 
the One, pervading in all; You are contained in all. You are diffused throughout and 
permeating all places and interspaces; You are known to be deep within the hearts of 
all beings. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and submitting to His 
Will, the True Lord is found. Nanak takes to the Sanctuary of God; he is forever and 
ever a sacrifice to Him.  || 1 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  If you are conscious, then be 
conscious of the True Lord, Your Lord and Master. O Nanak, come aboard upon the 
boat of the service of the True Guru, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||   
FIFTH MEHL:  He wears his body, like clothes of wind — what a proud fool he is! O 
Nanak,  they  will  not  go  with  him  in  the  end;  they  shall  be  burnt  to  ashes.  || 2 ||   
PAUREE:  They alone are delivered from the world, who are preserved and protected by 
the True Lord. I live by beholding the faces of those who taste the Ambrosial Essence of 
the Lord. Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are burnt away, in the 
Company of the Holy. God grants His Grace, and the Lord Himself tests them. O Nanak, 
His play is not known; no one can understand it.  || 2 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  O 
Nanak, that day is beautiful, when God comes to mind. Cursed is that day, no matter 
how pleasant the season, when the Supreme Lord God is forgotten.  || 1 ||   FIFTH 
MEHL:  O  Nanak, become friends with the One, who holds everything in His hands. 
They are accounted as false friends, who do not go with you, for even one step.  || 2 ||   
PAUREE:  The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar; meet 
together and drink it in, O Siblings of Destiny. Remembering Him in meditation, peace is 
found, and all thirst is quenched. So serve the Supreme Lord God and the Guru, and 
you shall never be hungry again. All your desires shall be fulfilled, and you shall obtain 
the status of immortality. You alone are as great as Yourself, O Supreme Lord God; 
Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.  || 3 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have seen all places; 
there is no place without Him.
