  790    1 Kings 10 
26  ¶ And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is 
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. 
27  And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had 
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
28  And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four 
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon 
1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon 
concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with 
hard questions. 
2  And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that 
bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she 
 
was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in 
her heart. 
3  And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing 
 
hid from the king, which he told her not. 
4  And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and 
the house that he had built, 
5  and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the 
attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, 
and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord; 
 
there was no more spirit in her. 
6  ¶ And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine 
own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
7  Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had 
seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and 
   
prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
8  Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand 
continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
