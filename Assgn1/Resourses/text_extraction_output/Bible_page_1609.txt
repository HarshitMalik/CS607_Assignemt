  1610    Isaiah 66 
Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an 
offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord. 
21  And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the 
Lord. 
22  Â¶ For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, 
shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your 
name remain. 
23  And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and 
from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before 
me, saith the Lord. 
24  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men 
that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, 
 
neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring 
 
unto all flesh.
