a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a 
 
possession. 
10  The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, 
and tall, as the Anakim; 
 
11  which also were accounted giants, as the Anakim; but the Moabites 
 
call them Emim. 
12  The Horim also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau 
 
succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, 
and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his 
 
possession, which the Lord gave unto them. 
13  Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went 
over the brook Zered. 
14  And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we 
were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until 
 
all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among 
the host, as the Lord sware unto them.  
15  For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy 
them from among the host, until they were consumed. 
16  Â¶ So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and 
dead from among the people, 
17  that the Lord spake unto me, saying, 
18  Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 
 
19  and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, 
distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of 
 
the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have 
 
given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. 
20  (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in 
 
old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim; 
   
21  a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the Lord 
 
destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt 
 
in their stead: 
 
22  as he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he 
destroyed the Horim from before them; and they succeeded them, 
 
and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
