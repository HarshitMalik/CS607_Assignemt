  1655    Jeremiah 20 
enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to 
Babylon. 
6  And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house, shall go into 
captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, 
 
and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou 
hast prophesied lies. 
Jeremiah’s Lament 
7  ¶ O Lord, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art 
 
stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every 
 
one mocketh me. 
8  For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the 
 
word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, 
daily. 
9  Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in 
his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up 
in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. 
10  For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say 
they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, 
saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against 
him, and we shall take our revenge on him. 
11  But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my 
 
persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be 
 
greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting 
   
confusion shall never be forgotten. 
12  But, O Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins 
and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee 
 
have I opened my cause. 
13  Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for he hath delivered the 
 
soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers. 
14  ¶ Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my 
 
mother bare me be blessed. 
15  Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man 
child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
