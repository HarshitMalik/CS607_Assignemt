The Book of Judges 
[Judges] 
1 
Judah and Simeon Capture Adoni-bezek 
1  Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of 
Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the 
Canaanites first, to fight against them? 
 
2  And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the 
 
land into his hand. 
3  And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into 
my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise 
 
will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
4  And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and 
 
the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten 
 
thousand men. 
5  And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against 
 
him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
6  But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, 
 
and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
7  And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their 
thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my 
table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought 
 
him to Jerusalem, and there he died. 
Judah Conquers Jerusalem and Hebron 
8  Â¶ Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had 
taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city 
on fire. 
9  And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the 
Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in 
the valley.
