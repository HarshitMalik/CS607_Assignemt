  489    Deuteronomy 32 
35  To me belongeth vengeance, and recompense; 
 
their foot shall slide in due time: 
 
for the day of their calamity is at hand, 
and the things that shall come upon them make haste. 
36  For the Lord shall judge his people, 
and repent himself for his servants, 
when he seeth that their power is gone, 
and there is none shut up, or left. 
37  And he shall say, Where are their gods, 
their rock in whom they trusted, 
38  which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, 
and drank the wine of their drink offerings? 
 
Let them rise up and help you, 
and be your protection. 
39  See now that I, even I, am he, 
and there is no god with me: 
 
I kill, and I make alive; 
 
I wound, and I heal: 
 
neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. 
40  For I lift up my hand to heaven, 
and say, I live for ever. 
41  If I whet my glittering sword, 
and mine hand take hold on judgment; 
 
I will render vengeance to mine enemies, 
and will reward them that hate me. 
42  I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, 
and my sword shall devour flesh; 
 
and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, 
from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. 
43  Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people:  
 
for he will avenge the blood of his servants,  
and will render vengeance to his adversaries, 
and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people. 
44  Â¶ And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears 
of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
