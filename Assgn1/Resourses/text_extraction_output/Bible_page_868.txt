22  He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept 
with his fathers. 
The Reign of Jeroboam 
23  ¶ In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, 
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, 
and reigned forty and one years. 
24  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed 
 
not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel 
to sin. 
25  He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto 
the sea of the plain, according to the word of the Lord God of 
Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of 
Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gath-hepher. 
26  For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for 
 
there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. 
27  And the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel 
from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the 
 
son of Joash. 
28  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his 
might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and 
Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in 
the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
29  And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; 
 
and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
