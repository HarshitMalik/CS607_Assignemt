The Blessings of Obedience 
1  And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the 
voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his 
commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy 
God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: 
 
2  and all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if 
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. 
3  Blessed shalt thou be in the city, 
and blessed shalt thou be in the field. 
4  Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, 
and the fruit of thy ground, 
and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, 
and the flocks of thy sheep. 
5  Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store. 
6  Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, 
and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
