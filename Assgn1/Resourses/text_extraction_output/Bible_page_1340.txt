  1341    Psalms 105 
33  I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: 
 
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 
34  My meditation of him shall be sweet: 
 
I will be glad in the Lord. 
35  Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, 
and let the wicked be no more. 
Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. 
Praise ye the Lord.

The Lordâ€™s Wonders in Behalf of Israel 
1  O give thanks unto the Lord; 
 
call upon his name: 
 
make known his deeds among the people. 
2  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: 
 
talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
3  Glory ye in his holy name: 
 
let the heart of them rejoice 
that seek the Lord. 
4  Seek the Lord, and his strength: 
 
seek his face evermore. 
5  Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; 
 
his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
 
6  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, 
ye children of Jacob his chosen. 
7  He is the Lord our God: 
 
his judgments are in all the earth. 
8  He hath remembered his covenant for ever, 
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. 
9  Which covenant he made with Abraham,  
and his oath unto Isaac;  
 
10  and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, 
and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
