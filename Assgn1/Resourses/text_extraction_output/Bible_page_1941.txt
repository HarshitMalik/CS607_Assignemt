  1942    Amos 9 
fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them 
shall not be delivered. 
2  ¶ Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; 
 
though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: 
 
3  and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search 
and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in 
 
the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he 
shall bite them: 
 
4  and though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will 
I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine 
 
eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. 
5  ¶ And the Lord God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it 
shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise 
 
up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of 
 
Egypt. 
6  It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his 
troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and 
 
poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his 
 
name. 
7  ¶ Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of 
Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land 
 
of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from 
 
Kir? 
 
8  Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and 
I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not 
 
utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord. 
9  For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all 
nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain 
fall upon the earth. 
10  All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The 
evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
