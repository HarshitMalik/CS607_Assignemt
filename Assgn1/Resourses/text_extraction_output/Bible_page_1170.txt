  1171    Job 27 
9  He holdeth back the face of his throne, 
and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
10  He hath compassed the waters with bounds, 
until the day and night come to an end. 
11  The pillars of heaven tremble, 
and are astonished at his reproof. 
12  He divideth the sea with his power, 
and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
13  By his Spirit he hath garnished the heavens; 
 
his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
14  Lo, these are parts of his ways; 
 
but how little a portion is heard of him? 
 
But the thunder of his power who can understand?

Job Describes the Portion of the Wicked 
1  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
2  As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; 
 
and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 
 
3  all the while my breath is in me, 
and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 
 
4  my lips shall not speak wickedness, 
nor my tongue utter deceit. 
5  God forbid that I should justify you: 
 
till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. 
6  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: 
 
my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 
7  Let mine enemy be as the wicked, 
and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 
8  For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, 
when God taketh away his soul? 
 
9  Will God hear his cry 
when trouble cometh upon him?
