  1181    Job 32 
32 
Elihu Justifies His Right to Answer Job 
1  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous 
in his own eyes. 
2  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the 
Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled,

had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
4  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder 
than he. 
5  When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these 
three men, then his wrath was kindled.

wherefore I was afraid, 
and durst not show you mine opinion. 
7  I said, Days should speak, 
and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
8  But there is a spirit in man: 
 
and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
9  Great men are not always wise:

10  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; 
 
I also will show mine opinion. 
11  Behold, I waited for your words; 
 
I gave ear to your reasons, 
whilst ye searched out what to say. 
12  Yea, I attended unto you, 
and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, 
or that answered his words: 
 
13  lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom:
