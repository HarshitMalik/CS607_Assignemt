The Excellencies of Godâ€™s Law 
aleph 
1  Blessed are the undefiled in the way, 
who walk in the law of the Lord. 
2  Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, 
and that seek him with the whole heart. 
3  They also do no iniquity: 
 
they walk in his ways. 
4  Thou hast commanded us 
to keep thy precepts diligently. 
5  O that my ways were directed 
to keep thy statutes! 
 
6  Then shall I not be ashamed, 
when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 
7  I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, 
when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. 
8  I will keep thy statutes: 
 
O forsake me not utterly. 
beth 
9  Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? 
 
By taking heed thereto according to thy word. 
10  With my whole heart have I sought thee: 
 
O let me not wander from thy commandments. 
11  Thy word have I hid in mine heart, 
that I might not sin against thee. 
12  Blessed art thou, O Lord: 
 
teach me thy statutes.
