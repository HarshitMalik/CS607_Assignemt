  1347    Psalms 107 
44  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, 
when he heard their cry: 
 
45  and he remembered for them his covenant, 
and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 
46  He made them also to be pitied 
of all those that carried them captives.  
47  Save us, O Lord our God, 
and gather us from among the heathen, 
to give thanks unto thy holy name, 
and to triumph in thy praise. 
48  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel 
from everlasting to everlasting: 
 
and let all the people say, Amen. 
Praise ye the Lord.  
107 
The Lord Delivers from Trouble 
1  O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever.  
2  Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, 
whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
 
3  and gathered them out of the lands, 
from the east, and from the west, 
from the north, and from the south. 
4  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; 
 
they found no city to dwell in. 
5  Hungry and thirsty, 
their soul fainted in them. 
6  Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, 
and he delivered them out of their distresses. 
7  And he led them forth by the right way, 
that they might go to a city of habitation. 
8  Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness,
