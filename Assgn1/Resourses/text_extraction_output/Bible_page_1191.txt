  1192    Job 38 
by words without knowledge? 
 
3  Gird up now thy loins like a man; 
 
for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 
4  Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? 
 
Declare, if thou hast understanding. 
5  Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? 
 
Or who hath stretched the line upon it? 
 
6  Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? 
 
Or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
 
7  when the morning stars sang together, 
and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
 
8  Or who shut up the sea with doors, 
when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? 
 
9  When I made the cloud the garment thereof, 
and thick darkness a swaddling band for it, 
10  and brake up for it my decreed place, 
and set bars and doors, 
11  and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: 
 
and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?  
 
12  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; 
 
and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
 
13  that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, 
that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
 
14  It is turned as clay to the seal; 
 
and they stand as a garment. 
15  And from the wicked their light is withholden, 
and the high arm shall be broken. 
16  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? 
 
Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
 
17  Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? 
 
Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 
 
18  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? 
 
Declare if thou knowest it all. 
19  Where is the way where light dwelleth? 
 
And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
