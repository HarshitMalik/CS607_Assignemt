  2082    Matthew 25 
21  His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: 
 
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler 
over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
 
22  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou 
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other 
 
talents beside them. 
23  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou 
 
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over 
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
 
24  Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I 
knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not 
sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: 
 
25  and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there 
 
thou hast that is thine. 
26  His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful 
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather 
where I have not strewed: 
 
27  thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, 
and then at my coming I should have received mine own with 
usury. 
28  Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which 
hath ten talents. 
29  For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have 
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even 
 
that which he hath.  
30  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there 
 
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
The Judgment of the Nations 
31  Â¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy 
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:  
 
32  and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate 
 
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the 
goats:
