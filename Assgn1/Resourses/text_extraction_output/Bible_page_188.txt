  189    Exodus 28 
18  The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth 
fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine twined linen, 
and their sockets of brass. 
19  All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the 
pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. 
The Tending of the Lamp 
20  ¶ And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring 
thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn 
always. 
21  In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is 
before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from 
evening to morning before the Lord: it shall be a statute for ever 
 
unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.

The Garments for the Priests 
1  And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, 
from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in 
the priest’s office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and 
Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. 
2  And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for 
glory and for beauty. 
3  And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have 
filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron’s 
garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the 
priest’s office. 
4  And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, 
 
and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a 
girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, 
 
and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
