  2375    Acts 24 
26  ¶ Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth 
greeting. 
27  This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of 
them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having 
 
understood that he was a Roman. 
28  And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused

sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers 
also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.

returned to the castle: 
 
33  who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the 
governor, presented Paul also before him. 
34  And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what 
province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; 
 
35  I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he 
commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.

Paul’s Defense before Felix

elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the 
governor against Paul. 
2  And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, 
saying, 
¶ Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very 
worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
