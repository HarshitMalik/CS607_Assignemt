  1069    Ezra 8 
25  ¶ And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine 
hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people 
that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and 
 
teach ye them that know them not. 
26  And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the 
king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be 
unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to 
imprisonment. 
27  ¶ Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a 
thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the Lord 
which is in Jerusalem: 
 
28  and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his 
counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was 
strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me, and I 
gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
