  1541    Isaiah 29 
7  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even 
all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, 
shall be as a dream of a night vision. 
8  It shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he 
eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty 
   
man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, 
 
behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude 
 
of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. 
The Blindness and Hypocrisy of Israel 
9  ¶ Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are 
   
drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong 
 
drink. 
10  For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, 
and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers 
 
hath he covered. 
11  And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that 
is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read 
this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: 
     
12  and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read 
this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. 
 
13  ¶ Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me 
with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have 
removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught 
by the precept of men: 
 
14  therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among 
this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom 
 
of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid.  
15  ¶ Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? 
 
and who knoweth us? 
 
16  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the 
potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made
