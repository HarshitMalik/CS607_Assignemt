  2421    Romans 16 
30  ¶ Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and 
for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your 
prayers to God for me; 
 
31  that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea; and 
 
that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the 
saints; 
 
32  that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may 
with you be refreshed. 
33  Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

Personal Greetings 
1  I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the 
church which is at Cenchreae: 
 
2  that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye 
assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath 
 
been a succorer of many, and of myself also.

4  who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not 
 
only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
