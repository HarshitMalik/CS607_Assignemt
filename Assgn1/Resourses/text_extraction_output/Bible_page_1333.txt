An Exhortation to Thanksgiving 
A Psalm of praise. 
1  Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. 
2  Serve the Lord with gladness: 
 
come before his presence with singing. 
3  Know ye that the Lord he is God: 
 
it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; 
 
we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
4  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
and into his courts with praise: 
 
be thankful unto him,and bless his name. 
5  For the Lord is good; 
 
his mercy is everlasting;  
 
and his truth endureth to all generations.

A Pledge to Live Righteously 
A Psalm of David. 
1  I will sing of mercy and judgment: 
 
unto thee, O Lord, will I sing. 
2  I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. 
O when wilt thou come unto me? 
 
I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
3  I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: 
 
I hate the work of them that turn aside; 
 
it shall not cleave to me. 
4  A froward heart shall depart from me: 
 
I will not know a wicked person.
