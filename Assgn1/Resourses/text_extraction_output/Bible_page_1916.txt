thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is 
departed from it. 
6  It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: 
 
Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his 
own counsel. 
7  As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. 
8  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: 
 
the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they 
 
shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.  
 
9  ¶ O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they 
 
stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not 
 
overtake them. 
10  It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall 
 
be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their 
two furrows. 
11  And Ephraim is as a heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the 
corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to 
   
ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods. 
 
12  ¶ Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your 
 
fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain 
 
righteousness upon you. 
13  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten 
 
the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the 
 
multitude of thy mighty men. 
14  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy 
fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day 
of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. 
 
15  So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a 
 
morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
