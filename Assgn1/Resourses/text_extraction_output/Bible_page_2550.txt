  2551    Hebrews 2 
a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
9  Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; 
 
therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee 
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  
10  And, 
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; 
 
and the heavens are the works of thine hands. 
11  They shall perish, but thou remainest: 
 
and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 
 
12  and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, 
and they shall be changed: 
 
but thou art the same, 
and thy years shall not fail.  
13  But to which of the angels said he at any time, 
Sit on my right hand, 
until I make thine enemies thy footstool? 
 
14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them 
who shall be heirs of salvation? 
 
2 
So Great Salvation 
1  Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things 
which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 
2  For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every 
transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of 
reward; 
 
3  how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the 
 
first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by 
them that heard him; 
 
4  God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and 
with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his 
own will?
