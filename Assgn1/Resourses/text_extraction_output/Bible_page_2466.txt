The Offering for the Saints 
1  Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed 
on the churches of Macedonia; 
 
2  how that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy and 
their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
3  For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they 
were willing of themselves; 
 
4  praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and 
take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.  
5  And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to 
the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
6  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would 
also finish in you the same grace also. 
7  Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and 
knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye 
abound in this grace also. 
8  Â¶ I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness 
of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
9  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was 
rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty 
might be rich. 
10  And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have 
 
begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
11  Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness 
 
to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye 
have. 
12  For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a 
man hath, and not according to that he hath not. 
13  For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
 
14  but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a 
supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for 
your want; that there may be equality:
