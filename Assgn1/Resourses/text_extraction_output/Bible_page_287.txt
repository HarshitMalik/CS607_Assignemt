  288    Leviticus 25 
well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he 
blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death. 
17  And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.  
18  And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 
 
19  And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so 
 
shall it be done to him; 
 
20  breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a 
 
blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. 
21  And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a 
 
man, he shall be put to death. 
22  Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one 
of your own country: for I am the Lord your God. 
 
23  And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring 
forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with 
stones: and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses. 
25 
Sabbath Years and the Year of Jubilee 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye 
come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a 
sabbath unto the Lord. 
3  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy 
vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
 
4  but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a 
sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune 
 
thy vineyard. 
5  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not 
reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year 
 
of rest unto the land.
