  646    1 Samuel 13 
7  And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and 
Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed 
him trembling. 
8  ¶ And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel 
had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were 
   
scattered from him. 
9  And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace 
offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 
10  And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering 
the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to 
 
meet him, that he might salute him. 
11  And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I 
 
saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest 
not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered 
themselves together at Michmash; 
 
12  therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to 
Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord: I forced 
 
myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. 
13  And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not 
 
kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he 
commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy 
 
kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
14  But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought 
 
him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded 
him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that 
which the Lord commanded thee. 
15  And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of 
Benjamin. 
¶ And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about 
six hundred men. 
16  And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present 
with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines 
 
encamped in Michmash.
