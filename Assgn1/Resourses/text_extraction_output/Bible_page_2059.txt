  2060    Matthew 18 
maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into 
everlasting fire.  
9  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is 
 
better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having 
two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  
The Parable of the Lost Sheep 
10  ¶ Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say 
 
unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of 
my Father which is in heaven. 
11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  
12  How think ye? if a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be 
 
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into 
the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? 
 
13  And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more 
of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. 
14  Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one 
of these little ones should perish. 
A Brother Who Sins 
15  ¶ Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell 
him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, 
 
thou hast gained thy brother.  
16  But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, 
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be 
established.  
17  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if 
 
he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen 
man and a publican. 
18  Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be 
bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be 
 
loosed in heaven.
