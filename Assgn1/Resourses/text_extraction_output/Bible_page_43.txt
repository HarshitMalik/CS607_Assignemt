  44    Genesis 21 
9  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast 
thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast 
 
brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done 
 
deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
10  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou 
hast done this thing? 
 
11  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not 
in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. 
 
12  And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but 
 
not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
 
13  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my 
father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou 
shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of 
 
me, He is my brother. 
14  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and 
womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him 
Sarah his wife. 
15  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it 
 
pleaseth thee. 
16  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a 
thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, 
 
unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was 
 
reproved. 
17  So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his 
 
wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 
 
18  For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of 
Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
