  2647    Revelation 20 
on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small 
and great.  
19  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, 
gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, 
and against his army. 
20  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that 
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that 
had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his 
image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with 
brimstone. 
21  And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon 
the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the 
 
fowls were filled with their flesh. 
20 
The Thousand Years 
1  And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the 
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 
2  And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the 
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 
3  and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal 
upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the 
thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed 
 
a little season. 
4  Â¶ And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was 
given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded 
 
for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had 
not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received 
his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and 
 
reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years 
were finished. This is the first resurrection.
