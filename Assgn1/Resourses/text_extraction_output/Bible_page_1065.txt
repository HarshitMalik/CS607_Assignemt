  1066    Ezra 6 
14  And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the 
prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. 
And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment 
of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, 
and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
15  And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, 
which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 
16  ¶ And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the 
rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this 
house of God with joy, 
17  and offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred 
bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin 
 
offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of 
the tribes of Israel. 
18  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their 
courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written 
 
in the book of Moses. 
19  ¶ And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the 
fourteenth day of the first month.  
20  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them 
were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the 
captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 
21  And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, 
and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the 
filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the Lord God of 
Israel, did eat, 
22  and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the 
 
Lord had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of 
Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the 
house of God, the God of Israel.
