22  Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of 
 
Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
23  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty 
and five thousand and four hundred. 
24  All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were a hundred 
thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, throughout their 
armies: and they shall go forward in the third rank. 
 
25  ¶ The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by 
their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer 
 
the son of Ammishaddai. 
26  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were 
threescore and two thousand and seven hundred. 
27  And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the 
 
captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
28  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty 
and one thousand and five hundred. 
29  Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of 
 
Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan. 
30  And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and 
three thousand and four hundred. 
31  All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were a hundred 
thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred: they shall 
 
go hindmost with their standards. 
32  ¶ These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by 
the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the 
 
camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three 
thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
33  But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as 
 
the Lord commanded Moses. 
34  ¶ And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord 
commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they 
 
set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of 
their fathers.
