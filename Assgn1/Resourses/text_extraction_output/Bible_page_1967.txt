  1968    Habakkuk 2 
10  And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn 
unto them: they shall deride every stronghold; for they shall heap 
   
dust, and take it. 
11  Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, 
imputing this his power unto his god. 
Habakkuk Remonstrates with the Lord 
12  ¶ Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? 
 
We shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; 
 
and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. 
13  Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on 
iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal 
 
treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth 
the man that is more righteous than he? 
 
14  and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that 
have no ruler over them? 
 
15  They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their 
net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are 
 
glad. 
16  Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their 
drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat 
 
plenteous. 
17  Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to 
slay the nations?

The Lord’s Answer to Habakkuk 
1  I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will 
watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer 
when I am reproved. 
2  And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make 
it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
