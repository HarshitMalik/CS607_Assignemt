  1981    Haggai 2 
19  Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and 
 
the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from 
 
this day will I bless you. 
The Lord’s Promise to Zerubbabel 
20  ¶ And again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai in the four 
and twentieth day of the month, saying, 
21  Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the 
heavens and the earth; 
 
22  and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the 
strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the 
 
chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their 
 
riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 
23  In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, 
my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make 
thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.
