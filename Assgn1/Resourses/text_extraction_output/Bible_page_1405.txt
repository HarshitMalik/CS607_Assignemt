  1406    Proverbs 3 
3  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: 
 
bind them about thy neck; 
 
write them upon the table of thine heart: 
 
4  so shalt thou find favor and good understanding 
in the sight of God and man.  
5  Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; 
 
and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
6  In all thy ways acknowledge him, 
and he shall direct thy paths. 
7  Be not wise in thine own eyes:  
 
fear the Lord, and depart from evil. 
8  It shall be health to thy navel, 
and marrow to thy bones. 
9  Honor the Lord with thy substance, 
and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 
 
10  so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, 
and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 
11  My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; 
 
neither be weary of his correction:  
 
12  for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth;  
 
even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.  
13  Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, 
and the man that getteth understanding: 
 
14  for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, 
and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
15  She is more precious than rubies: 
 
and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto 
her. 
16  Length of days is in her right hand; 
 
and in her left hand riches and honor. 
17  Her ways are ways of pleasantness, 
and all her paths are peace. 
18  She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: 
 
and happy is every one that retaineth her. 
19  The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth;
