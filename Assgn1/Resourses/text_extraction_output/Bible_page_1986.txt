  1987    Zechariah 5 
11  ¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive 
trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side 
thereof? 
 
12  And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive 
branches, which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil 
out of themselves? 
 
13  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? 
 
And I said, No, my lord. 
14  Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the 
Lord of the whole earth.

The Flying Roll 
1  Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a 
flying roll. 
2  And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a 
 
flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth 
 
thereof ten cubits. 
3  Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the 
face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as 
 
on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut 
 
off as on that side according to it. 
4  I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into 
the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth 
falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, 
 
and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones 
thereof. 
The Woman in the Ephah 
5  ¶ Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, 
Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
