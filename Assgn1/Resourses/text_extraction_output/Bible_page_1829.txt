  1830    Ezekiel 34 
neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither 
have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty 
 
have ye ruled them. 
5  And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they 
 
became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered. 
6  My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every 
high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, 
 
and none did search or seek after them. 
7  ¶ Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; 
 
8  As I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my flock became a 
prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because 
there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my 
flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 
 
9  therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; 
 
10  Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I 
   
will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from 
feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any 
 
more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may 
 
not be meat for them. 
11  ¶ For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search 
 
my sheep, and seek them out. 
12  As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his 
sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver 
 
them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy 
and dark day. 
13  And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from 
the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed 
them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the 
inhabited places of the country. 
14  I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of 
Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a 
 
fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. 
15  I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the 
Lord God.
