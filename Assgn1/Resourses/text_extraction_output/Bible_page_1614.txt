  1615    Jeremiah 3 
28  But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if 
 
they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the 
 
number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. 
29  ¶ Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against 
 
me, saith the Lord. 
30  In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: 
   
your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying 
lion. 
31  O generation, see ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a 
wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my 
   
people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee? 
   
32  Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my 
 
people have forgotten me days without number. 
33  ¶ Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou 
 
also taught the wicked ones thy ways. 
34  Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor 
innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these. 
 
35  Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn 
from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have 
not sinned. 
36  Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also 
 
shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
37  Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine 
head: for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt 
 
not prosper in them. 
3 
1  They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and 
become another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not 
 
that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with 
 
many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord. 
 
2  Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not 
been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian
