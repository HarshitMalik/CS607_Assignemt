|| 1 ||  Pause  ||   Making pilgrimages to sacred rivers, observing the six rituals, wearing 
matted  and  tangled  hair,  performing  fire  sacrifices  and  carrying  ceremonial  walking 
sticks  —  none  of  these  are  of  any  use.    ||  1  ||      All  sorts  of  efforts,  austerities, 
wanderings and various speeches — none of these will lead you to find the Lord‟s Place. 
I have considered all considerations, O Nanak, but peace comes only by vibrating and 
meditating on the Name.  || 2 || 2 || 39 ||    
KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  NINTH HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear — He carries us 
across to the other side.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My eyes are satisfied, gazing upon the 
Blessed Vision of His Darshan; my ears are satisfied, hearing His Praise.  || 1 ||   He is 
the  Master  of  the  praanaa,  the  breath  of  life;  He  is  the  Giver  of  Support  to  the 
unsupported. I am meek and poor — I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe. 
He is the Fulfiller of hope, the Destroyer of pain. Nanak grasps the Support of the Feet 
of the Lord.  || 2 || 1 || 40 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  I seek the Sanctuary of the 
Feet of my  Merciful  Lord and Master; I do not go anywhere else. It is the Inherent 
Nature of our Lord and Master to purify sinners. Those who meditate on the Lord are 
saved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The world is a swamp of wickedness and corruption. The 
blind sinner has fallen into the ocean of emotional attachment and pride, bewildered by 
the entanglements of Maya. God Himself has taken me by the hand and lifted me up 
and out of it; save me, O Sovereign Lord of the Universe.  || 1 ||   He is the Master of 
the masterless, the Supporting Lord of the Saints, the Neutralizer of millions of sins. My 
mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. God is the Perfect Treasure of Virtue. 
O Nanak, sing and savor the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Kind and Compassionate 
Lord of the World.  || 2 || 2 || 41 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Countless times, I am a 
sacrifice, a sacrifice to that moment of peace, on that night when I was joined with my 
Beloved.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Mansions of gold, and beds of silk sheets — O sisters, I 
have no love for these.  || 1 ||   Pearls, jewels and countless pleasures, O Nanak, are 
useless and destructive without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Even with only dry 
crusts  of  bread,  and  a  hard  floor  on  which  to  sleep,  my  life  passes  in  peace  and 
pleasure with my Beloved, O sisters.  || 2 || 3 || 42 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL:  Give 
up your ego, and turn your face to God. Let your yearning mind call out, “Guru, Guru”. 
My Beloved is the Lover of Love.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The bed of your household shall be 
cozy, and your courtyard shall be comfortable; shatter and break the bonds which tie 
you to the five thieves.  || 1 ||   You shall not come and go in reincarnation; you shall 
dwell in your own home deep within, and your inverted heart-lotus shall blossom forth. 
The turmoil of egotism shall be silenced. Nanak sings — he sings the Praises of God, 
the Ocean of Virtue.  || 2 || 4 || 43 ||   KAANRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  NINTH HOUSE:  This 
is why you should chant and meditate on the Lord, O mind. The Vedas and the Saints 
say  that  the  path  is  treacherous  and  difficult.  You  are  intoxicated  with  emotional 
attachment  and  the  fever  of  egotism.    ||    Pause    ||      Those  who  are  imbued  and 
intoxicated with the wretched Maya, suffer the pains of emotional attachment.  || 1 ||   
That humble being is saved, who chants the Naam; You Yourself save him.
