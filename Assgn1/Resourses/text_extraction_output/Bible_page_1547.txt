  1548    Isaiah 33 
15  until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness 
be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. 
16  ¶ Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness 
remain in the fruitful field. 
17  And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of 
 
righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. 
18  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure 
dwellings, and in quiet resting places; 
 
19  when it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be 
 
low in a low place. 
20  Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the 
feet of the ox and the ass. 
33 
The Lord Will Bring Salvation 
1  Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest 
 
treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when 
 
thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt 
 
make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously 
with thee. 
2  ¶ O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou 
   
their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 
3  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of 
 
thyself the nations were scattered. 
4  And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the 
caterpillar: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon 
 
them. 
5  The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion 
   
with judgment and righteousness. 
6  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and 
strength of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure. 
 
7  ¶ Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of 
 
peace shall weep bitterly.
