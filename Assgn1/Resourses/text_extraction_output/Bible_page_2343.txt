  2344    Acts 13 
20  And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four 
hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.  
21  And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul 
 
the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of 
forty years. 
22  And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to 
be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have 
 
found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which 
shall fulfil all my will.  
23  Of this man’s seed hath God, according to his promise, raised unto 
Israel a Saviour, Jesus: 
 
24  when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of 
repentance to all the people of Israel. 
25  And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? 
 
I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes 
of his feet I am not worthy to loose.  
26  ¶ Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and 
whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this 
salvation sent. 
27  For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they 
knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read 
every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. 
28  And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they 
Pilate that he should be slain.  
29  And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took 
him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.  
30  But God raised him from the dead: 
 
31  and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from 
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. 
32  And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which 
was made unto the fathers, 
33  God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath 
raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, 
 
Thou art my Son, 
this day have I begotten thee.
