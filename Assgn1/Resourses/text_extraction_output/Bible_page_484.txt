  485    Deuteronomy 32 
23  ¶ And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong 
and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel 
 
into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. 
 
The Law to Be Placed in the Ark 
24  ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the 
words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
25  that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the 
covenant of the Lord, saying, 
26  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the 
covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness 
against thee. 
27  For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet 
 
alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; 
 
and how much more after my death? 
 
28  Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I 
may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to 
record against them. 
29  For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, 
and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and 
 
evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the 
 
sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of 
your hands. 
The Song of Moses 
30  ¶ And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the 
words of this song, until they were ended. 
32 
1  Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; 
 
and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 
2  My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
