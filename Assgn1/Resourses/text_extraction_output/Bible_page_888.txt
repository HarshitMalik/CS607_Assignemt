  889    2 Kings 21 
6  And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and 
used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he 
 
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him 
to anger. 
7  And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the 
house, of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, 
In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the 
tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
 
8  neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land 
which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according 
 
to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law 
that my servant Moses commanded them.  
9  But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more 
 
evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the 
children of Israel. 
10  ¶ And the Lord spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 
11  Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, 
and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were 
before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 
 
12  therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing 
such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, 
both his ears shall tingle. 
13  And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the 
plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man 
 
wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. 
14  And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver 
them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey 
 
and a spoil to all their enemies; 
 
15  because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have 
provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of 
Egypt, even unto this day. 
16  ¶ Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had 
filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin 
 
wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the 
sight of the Lord.
