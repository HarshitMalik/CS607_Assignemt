  1790    Ezekiel 19 
23  Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord 
 
God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live? 
   
24  But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and 
committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations 
that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that 
 
he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath 
 
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. 
25  ¶ Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of 
Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? 
     
26  When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and 
committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he 
 
hath done shall he die. 
27  Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness 
that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, 
he shall save his soul alive. 
28  Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his 
transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall 
not die. 
29  Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O 
house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? 
   
30  ¶ Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according 
to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent, and turn yourselves from 
all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 
 
31  Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have 
transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why 
   
will ye die, O house of Israel? 
 
32  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord 
God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.
