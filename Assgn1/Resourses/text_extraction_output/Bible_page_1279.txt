  1280    Psalms 63 
if riches increase, 
set not your heart upon them. 
11  God hath spoken once; 
 
twice have I heard this; 
 
that power belongeth unto God. 
12  Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: 
 
for thou renderest to every man according to his work.

God Satisfies the Thirsting Soul 
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.  
1  O God, thou art my God; 
 
early will I seek thee: 
 
my soul thirsteth for thee, 
my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, 
where no water is; 
 
2  to see thy power and thy glory, 
so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 
3  Because thy loving-kindness is better than life, 
my lips shall praise thee. 
4  Thus will I bless thee while I live: 
 
I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
5  My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; 
 
and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: 
 
6  when I remember thee upon my bed, 
and meditate on thee in the night watches. 
7  Because thou hast been my help, 
therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 
8  My soul followeth hard after thee: 
 
thy right hand upholdeth me. 
9  But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, 
shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
