  2220    Luke 19 
15  And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received 
the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto 
him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how 
much every man had gained by trading. 
16  Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten 
pounds. 
17  And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast 
 
been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
18  And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five 
pounds. 
19  And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 
20  And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I 
have kept laid up in a napkin: 
 
21  for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up 
 
that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. 
22  And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, 
thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, 
taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 
 
23  wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at 
my coming I might have required mine own with usury? 
 
24  And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, 
and give it to him that hath ten pounds. 
25  (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 
26  For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; 
 
and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away 
from him.  
27  But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over 
them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
