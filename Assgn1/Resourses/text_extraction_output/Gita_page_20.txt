BHAGAVAD GITA
GITA MAHATMYA
GLORY OF THE GITA
(To be read at the end of the dayâ€™s Gita study)
Sri Ganeshaaya Namah! Gopaalakrishnaaya Namah!
Dharovaacha:
Bhagavan parameshaana bhaktiravyabhichaarinee;
Praarabdham bhujyamaanasya katham bhavati he prabho.
The Earth said:
1. O Bhagavan, the Supreme Lord! How can unflinching devotion arise in him who is
immersed in his Prarabdha Karmas (worldly life), O Lord?
Sri Vishnuruvaacha:
Praarabdham bhujyamaano hi geetaabhyaasaratah sadaa;
Sa muktah sa sukhee loke karmanaa nopalipyate.
Lord Vishnu said:
2. Though engaged in the performance of worldly duties, one who is regular in the study of
the Gita becomes free. He is the happy man in this world. He is not bound by Karma.
Mahaapaapaadipaapaani geetaadhyaanam karoti chet;
Kwachit sparsham na kurvanti nalineedalam ambuvat.
3. Just as the water stains not the lotus leaf, even so sins do not taint him who is regular in the
recitation of the Gita.
Geetaayaah pustakam yatra yatra paathah pravartate;
Tatra sarvaani teerthaani prayaagaadeeni tatra vai.
4. All the sacred centres of pilgrimage, like Prayag and other places, dwell in that place
where the Gita is kept, and where the Gita is read.
Sarve devaashcha rishayo yoginahpannagaashcha ye;
Gopaalaa gopikaa vaapi naaradoddhava paarshadaih.
5. All the gods, sages, Yogins, divine serpents, Gopalas, Gopikas (friends and devotees of
Lord Krishna), Narada, Uddhava and others (dwell here).
Sahaayo jaayate sheeghram yatra geetaa pravartate;
Yatra geetaavichaarashcha pathanam paathanam shrutam;
Tatraaham nishchitam prithvi nivasaami sadaiva hi.
