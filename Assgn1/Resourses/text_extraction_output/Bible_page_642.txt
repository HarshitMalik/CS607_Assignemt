Samuel’s Address to the People 
1  And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto 
your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over 
you. 
2  And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and 
 
grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked 
   
before you from my childhood unto this day. 
3  Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and before 
 
his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or 
     
whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose 
   
hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I 
 
will restore it you. 
4  And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, 
neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand. 
5  And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his 
anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my 
hand. And they answered, He is witness. 
6  ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that advanced 
Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land 
of Egypt. 
7  Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the 
Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you 
and to your fathers. 
8  When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the 
Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth 
your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 
9  And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the 
hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of 
the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they 
fought against them. 
10  And they cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because 
we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and
