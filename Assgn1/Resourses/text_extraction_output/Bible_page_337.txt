  338    Numbers 13 
9  ¶ And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he 
 
departed. 
10  And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, 
 
Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon 
 
Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 
11  And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not 
the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we 
have sinned. 
12  Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed 
when he cometh out of his mother’s womb. 
13  And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I 
beseech thee. 
14  And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her 
face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out 
 
from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in 
again. 
15  And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the 
 
people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. 
16  And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in 
the wilderness of Paran.

The Twelve Spies Sent to Canaan 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I 
give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall 
 
ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. 
3  And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the 
wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of 
 
Israel. 
4  And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the 
 
son of Zaccur. 
5  Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
