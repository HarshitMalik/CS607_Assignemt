  2029    Matthew 8 
9  For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I 
 
say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he 
 
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
 
10  When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, 
Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in 
Israel. 
11  And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, 
and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the 
kingdom of heaven:  
 
12  but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer 
darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
 
13  And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast 
 
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the 
selfsame hour. 
Jesus Heals Peter’s Mother-in-Law 
14  ¶ And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s 
mother laid, and sick of a fever. 
15  And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and 
 
ministered unto them. 
16  When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were 
possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and 
 
healed all that were sick: 
 
17  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, 
saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  
The Would-be Followers of Jesus 
18  ¶ Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave 
commandment to depart unto the other side. 
19  And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow 
thee whithersoever thou goest. 
20  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the 
air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
