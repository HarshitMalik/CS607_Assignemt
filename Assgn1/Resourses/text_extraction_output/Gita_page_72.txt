BHAGAVAD GITA
Yuktaswapnaavabodhasya yogo bhavati duhkhahaa.
17. Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is always moderate in eating and
recreation (such as walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep
and wakefulness.
Yadaa viniyatam chittamaatmanyevaavatishthate;
Nihsprihah sarvakaamebhyo yukta ityuchyate tadaa.
18. When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for the
objects of desire, then it is said: “He is united.”
COMMENTARY: Without union with the Self neither harmony nor balance nor Samadhi
is possible.
Yathaa deepo nivaatastho nengate sopamaa smritaa;
Yogino yatachittasya yunjato yogamaatmanah.
19. As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker—to such is compared the Yogi of
controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).
COMMENTARY: This is a beautiful simile which Yogis often quote when they talk of
concentration or one-pointedness of mind.
Yatroparamate chittam niruddham yogasevayaa;
Yatra chaivaatmanaa’tmaanam pashyannaatmani tushyati.
20. When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga, attains to quietude, and when, seeing
the Self by the Self, he is satisfied in his own Self,
Sukhamaatyantikam yattad buddhi graahyamateendriyam;
Vetti yatra na chaivaayam sthitashchalati tattwatah.
21. When he (the Yogi) feels that infinite bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect
and which transcends the senses, and, established wherein he never moves from the Reality,
Yam labdhwaa chaaparam laabham manyate naadhikam tatah;
Yasmin sthito na duhkhena gurunaapi vichaalyate.
22. Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein
established, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow,—
Tam vidyaad duhkhasamyogaviyogam yogasamjnitam;
Sa nishchayena yoktavyo yogo’nirvinna chetasaa.
