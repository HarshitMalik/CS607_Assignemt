  1581    Isaiah 49 
6  And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to 
raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I 
 
will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be 
my salvation unto the end of the earth.  
7  Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to 
him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a 
servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall 
worship, because of the Lord that is faithful, and the Holy One of 
Israel, and he shall choose thee. 
The Restoration of Zion Promised 
8  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, 
and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve 
 
thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the 
earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 
 
9  that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in 
 
darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their 
pastures shall be in all high places. 
10  They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun 
 
smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even 
 
by the springs of water shall he guide them.  
11  And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be 
exalted. 
12  Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north 
 
and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. 
 
13  Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into 
   
singing, O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted his people, 
 
and will have mercy upon his afflicted. 
14  ¶ But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath 
forgotten me. 
15  Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have 
compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will 
 
I not forget thee.
