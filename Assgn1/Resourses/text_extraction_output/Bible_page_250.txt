  251    Leviticus 11 
20  ¶ All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination 
unto you. 
21  Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon 
all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the 
earth; 
 
22  even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald 
 
locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the 
grasshopper after his kind. 
23  But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an 
abomination unto you. 
24  ¶ And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass 
 
of them shall be unclean until the even. 
25  And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his 
clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
26  The carcasses of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not 
cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every 
 
one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 
27  And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts 
that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth 
 
their carcass shall be unclean until the even. 
28  And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and 
be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. 
 
29  ¶ These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things 
that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the 
 
tortoise after his kind, 
30  and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, 
and the mole. 
31  These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth 
 
touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 
32  And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it 
shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or 
 
skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it 
must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it 
 
shall be cleansed.
