  105    Genesis 43 
2  And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they 
had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, 
buy us a little food. 
3  And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest 
unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be 
with you. 
4  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee 
food: 
 
5  but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said 
 
unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
6  And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man 
whether ye had yet a brother? 
 
7  And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our 
kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? 
   
and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we 
 
certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
 
8  And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we 
will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, 
 
and also our little ones. 
9  I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I 
   
bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear 
the blame for ever: 
 
10  for except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second 
time. 
11  Â¶ And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do 
this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry 
 
down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and 
myrrh, nuts and almonds: 
 
12  and take double money in your hand; and the money that was 
 
brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your 
hand; peradventure it was an oversight. 
 
13  Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
 
14  and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may 
send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my 
children, I am bereaved.
