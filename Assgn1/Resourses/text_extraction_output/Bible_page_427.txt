  428    Deuteronomy 8 
26  Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest 
thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and 
 
thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

A Good Land to Be Possessed 
1  All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye 
observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess 
the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers. 
2  And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led 
thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to 
prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou 
wouldest keep his commandments, or no. 
3  And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee 
with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers 
know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by 
 
bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of 
the Lord doth man live.  
4  Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, 
these forty years. 
5  Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth 
his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee. 
6  Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy 
God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
7  For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of 
brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys 
and hills; 
 
8  a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and 
pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 
   
9  a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt 
not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of 
 
whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
