  2316    Acts 4 
13  ¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and 
perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they 
marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been 
 
with Jesus. 
14  And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, 
they could say nothing against it. 
15  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, 
they conferred among themselves, 
16  saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable 
 
miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell 
in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. 
 
17  But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly 
threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
18  And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor 
teach in the name of Jesus. 
19  But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be 
right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, 
judge ye. 
20  For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. 
21  So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, 
finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the 
people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. 
 
22  For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of 
healing was showed. 
The Believers Pray for Boldness 
23  ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported 
all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
24  And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with 
one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, 
and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is;  
 
25  who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, 
Why did the heathen rage, 
and the people imagine vain things?
