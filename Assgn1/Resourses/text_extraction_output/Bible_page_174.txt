  175    Exodus 22 
33  ¶ And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not 
cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 
 
34  the owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the 
owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. 
 
35  ¶ And if one man’s ox hurt another’s that he die; then they shall 
 
sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also 
 
they shall divide. 
36  Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his 
owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the 
   
dead shall be his own.

Laws concerning Restitution 
1  If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall 
 
restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 
2  ¶ If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there 
shall no blood be shed for him. 
3  If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he 
 
should make full restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be 
 
sold for his theft. 
4  If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or 
ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. 
 
5  ¶ If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put 
in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his 
 
own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make 
restitution. 
6  ¶ If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or 
the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that 
 
kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. 
7  ¶ If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, 
and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, let 
 
him pay double.
