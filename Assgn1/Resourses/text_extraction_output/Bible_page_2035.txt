  2036    Matthew 10 
21  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the 
father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, 
 
and cause them to be put to death.  
22  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that 
 
endureth to the end shall be saved.  
23  But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for 
 
verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, 
till the Son of man be come. 
24  ¶ The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his 
lord.  
25  It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant 
as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, 
how much more shall they call them of his household? 
 
Whom to Fear 
26  ¶ Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall 
 
not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  
 
27  What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear 
 
in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. 
28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the 
soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and 
 
body in hell. 
29  Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not 
 
fall on the ground without your Father. 
30  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
31  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
32  Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I 
confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 
33  But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny 
before my Father which is in heaven.
