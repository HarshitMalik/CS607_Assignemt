  1284    Psalms 66 
they went through the flood on foot:  
 
there did we rejoice in him. 
7  He ruleth by his power for ever; 
 
his eyes behold the nations: 
 
let not the rebellious exalt themselves. 
Selah. 
8  O bless our God, ye people, 
and make the voice of his praise to be heard: 
 
9  which holdeth our soul in life, 
and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
10  For thou, O God, hast proved us: 
 
thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 
11  Thou broughtest us into the net; 
 
thou laidst affliction upon our loins. 
12  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; 
 
we went through fire and through water: 
 
but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 
13  I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: 
 
I will pay thee my vows, 
14  which my lips have uttered, 
and my mouth hath spoken, 
when I was in trouble. 
15  I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, 
with the incense of rams: 
 
I will offer bullocks with goats. 
Selah. 
16  Come and hear, all ye that fear God, 
and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
17  I cried unto him with my mouth, 
and he was extolled with my tongue. 
18  If I regard iniquity in my heart, 
the Lord will not hear me: 
 
19  but verily God hath heard me; 
 
he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 
20  Blessed be God,
