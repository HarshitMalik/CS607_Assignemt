  783    1 Kings 8 
18  And the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine 
heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in 
thine heart.  
19  Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall 
 
come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.  
20  And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am 
risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of 
Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built a house for the name 
of the Lord God of Israel. 
21  I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the 
Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out 
of the land of Egypt. 
22  ¶ And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence 
of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward 
heaven: 
 
23  and he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven 
above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with 
thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart: 
 
24  who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou 
promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast 
 
fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
25  Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David 
my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail 
thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy 
 
children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou 
hast walked before me.  
26  And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, 
which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 
27  ¶ But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and 
 
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house 
 
that I have builded?  
 
28  Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his 
supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the 
prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee today:
