  2204    Luke 13 
25  When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the 
door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, 
saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto 
 
you, I know you not whence ye are: 
 
26  then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy 
presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. 
27  But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart 
 
from me, all ye workers of iniquity.  
28  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see 
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the 
kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. 
29  And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the 
north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of 
God.  
30  And, behold, there are last which shall be first; and there are first 
 
which shall be last.  
Jesus Laments over Jerusalem 
31  Â¶ The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto 
him, Get thee out, and depart hence; for Herod will kill thee. 
 
32  And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out 
devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall 
be perfected. 
33  Nevertheless I must walk today, and tomorrow, and the day 
following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. 
 
34  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest 
them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy 
 
children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, 
and ye would not! 
 
35  Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto 
 
you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, 
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
