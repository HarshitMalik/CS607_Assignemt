18  ¶ And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and 
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
 
19  and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the the men 
of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, 
which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, 
which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the 
people of the land that were found in the city: 
 
20  and Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought 
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.

22  ¶ And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made 
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. 
23  And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard 
that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came 
to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and 
Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the 
Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and 
their men. 
24  And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto 
them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the 
 
land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.  
 
25  But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of 
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten 
men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and 
the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
