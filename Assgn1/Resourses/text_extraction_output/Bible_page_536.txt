  537    Joshua 19 
5  and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah, 
6  and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages: 
   
7  Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages: 
   
8  and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-
beer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the 
children of Simeon according to their families.  
9  Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of 
the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was 
 
too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their 
 
inheritance within the inheritance of them. 
10  ¶ And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according 
to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto 
 
Sarid: 
 
11  and their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached 
to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam; 
 
12  and turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the 
border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and 
goeth up to Japhia, 
13  and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to 
Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to Neah; 
 
14  and the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and 
 
the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah-el: 
 
15  and Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and 
Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages. 
 
16  This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their 
families, these cities with their villages. 
17  ¶ And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of 
Issachar according to their families. 
18  And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem, 
19  and Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 
20  and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez, 
21  Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez; 
 
22  and the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-
shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen 
   
cities with their villages.
