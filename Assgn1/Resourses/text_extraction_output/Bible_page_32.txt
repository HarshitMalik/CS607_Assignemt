  33    Genesis 16 
9  And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she 
goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a 
turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
10  And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and 
laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
 
11  And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove 
them away. 
12  ¶ And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; 
 
and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him. 
13  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a 
stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they 
 
shall afflict them four hundred years;  
 
14  and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and 
 
afterward shall they come out with great substance.  
15  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a 
 
good old age. 
16  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the 
 
iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. 
17  ¶ And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was 
dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed 
between those pieces. 
18  In that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, 
Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto 
the great river, the river Euphrates: 
 
19  the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 
20  and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim, 
21  and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the 
Jebusites.

Hagar and Ishmael 
1  Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bare him no children: and she had a 
 
handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
