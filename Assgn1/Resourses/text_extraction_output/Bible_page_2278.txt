  2279    John 12 
57  Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a 
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should 
show it, that they might take him.

Jesus Anointed at Bethany 
1  Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where 
Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
2  There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus 
   
was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
3  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and 
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the 
 
house was filled with the odor of the ointment. 
4  Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which 
should betray him, 
5  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and 
given to the poor? 
 
6  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a 
 
thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 
7  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath 
 
she kept this. 
8  For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. 
 
The Plot against Lazarus 
9  ¶ Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and 
 
they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus 
also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
10  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to 
death; 
 
11  because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and 
believed on Jesus.
