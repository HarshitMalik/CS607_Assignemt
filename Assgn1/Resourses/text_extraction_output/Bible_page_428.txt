  429    Deuteronomy 8 
10  When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord 
thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 
Warning against Forgetting the Lord 
11  Â¶ Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping 
his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I 
command thee this day: 
 
12  lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, 
and dwelt therein; 
 
13  and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy 
gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 
 
14  then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, 
which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house 
of bondage; 
 
15  who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein 
were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no 
water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 
   
16  who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers 
knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove 
thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;  
 
17  and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand 
hath gotten me this wealth. 
18  But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth 
 
thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which 
he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day. 
19  And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk 
after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify 
against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 
20  As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face, so shall 
ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the 
 
Lord your God.
