Admonitions to a King 
1  The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught 
him. 
2  What, my son? 
 
And what, the son of my womb? 
 
And what, the son of my vows? 
 
3  Give not thy strength unto women, 
nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 
4  It is not for kings, O Lemuel, 
it is not for kings to drink wine; 
 
nor for princes strong drink: 
 
5  lest they drink, and forget the law, 
and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 
6  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, 
and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 
7  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, 
and remember his misery no more. 
8  Open thy mouth for the dumb 
in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 
9  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, 
and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 
Praise of a Good Woman 
10  Who can find a virtuous woman? 
 
For her price is far above rubies. 
11  The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, 
so that he shall have no need of spoil. 
12  She will do him good and not evil 
all the days of her life.
