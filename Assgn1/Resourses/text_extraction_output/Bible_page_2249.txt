  2250    John 4 
35  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  
36  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that 
 
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God 
 
abideth on him.

Jesus and the Woman of Samaria 
1  When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that 
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
2  (though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
3  he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee. 
4  And he must needs go through Samaria. 
5  Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to 
the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  
6  Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his 
journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
 
7  ¶ There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith 
 
unto her, Give me to drink. 
8  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
9  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, 
being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for 
 
the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  
10  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, 
and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest 
 
have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
11  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, 
and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
   
12  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and 
drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
 
13  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this 
water shall thirst again:
