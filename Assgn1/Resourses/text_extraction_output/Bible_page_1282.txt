  1283    Psalms 66 
thou preparest them corn, 
when thou hast so provided for it. 
10  Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: 
 
thou settlest the furrows thereof: 
 
thou makest it soft with showers: 
 
thou blessest the springing thereof. 
11  Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; 
 
and thy paths drop fatness. 
12  They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: 
 
and the little hills rejoice on every side. 
13  The pastures are clothed with flocks; 
 
the valleys also are covered over with corn; 
 
they shout for joy, they also sing.

and shall sing unto thee; 
 
they shall sing to thy name.
