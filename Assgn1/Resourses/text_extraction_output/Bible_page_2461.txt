  2462    2 Corinthians 5 
14  knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us 
also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. 
15  For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might 
through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. 
16  ¶ For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man 
 
perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 
17  For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a 
far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; 
 
18  while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things 
which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but 
   
the things which are not seen are eternal. 
5 
1  For we know that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were 
dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, 
eternal in the heavens. 
2  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our 
house which is from heaven: 
 
3  if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
4  For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for 
 
that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality 
might be swallowed up of life. 
5  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who 
also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
6  ¶ Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at 
home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
 
7  (for we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
 
8  we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the 
body, and to be present with the Lord. 
9  Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be 
accepted of him. 
10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that 
 
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that 
he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
