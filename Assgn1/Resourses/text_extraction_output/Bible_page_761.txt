  762    1 Kings 2 
45  and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him 
king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that 
 
the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. 
46  And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
47  And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king 
David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy 
name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king 
bowed himself upon the bed. 
48  And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, 
which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even 
seeing it. 
49  ¶ And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose 
up, and went every man his way. 
50  And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and 
caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
51  And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king 
Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, 
 
saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay 
his servant with the sword. 
52  And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there 
shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be 
 
found in him, he shall die. 
53  So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. 
And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon 
 
said unto him, Go to thine house.

David’s Charge to Solomon 
1  Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he 
 
charged Solomon his son, saying, 
2  I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show 
 
thyself a man;
