  671    1 Samuel 22 
8  ¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under 
thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword 
 
nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required 
haste. 
9  And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom 
thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a 
cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no 
   
other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it 
 
me. 
10  ¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to 
Achish the king of Gath. 
11  And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king 
of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, 
 
saying, 
Saul hath slain his thousands, 
and David his ten thousands? 
 
12  And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of 
Achish the king of Gath.  
13  And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself 
mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let 
his spittle fall down upon his beard. 
14  Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: 
 
wherefore then have ye brought him to me? 
 
15  Have I need of madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the 
madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

1  David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: 
 
and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went 
down thither to him. 
2  And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, 
and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto 
him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him 
   
about four hundred men.
