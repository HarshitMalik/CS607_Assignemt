  718    2 Samuel 12 
22  ¶ So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab 
had sent him for. 
23  And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed 
against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon 
them even unto the entering of the gate. 
24  And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and 
 
some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the 
Hittite is dead also. 
25  Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto 
Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one 
as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and 
 
overthrow it: and encourage thou him. 
 
26  ¶ And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was 
dead, she mourned for her husband. 
27  And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to 
his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the 
thing that David had done displeased the Lord.

Nathan Reproves David 
1  And the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, 
and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, 
 
and the other poor. 
2  The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 
 
3  but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he 
had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, 
 
and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his 
 
own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 
4  And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take 
of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring 
man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and 
 
dressed it for the man that was come to him.
