  1311    Psalms 81 
upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 
18  So will not we go back from thee: 
 
quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 
19  Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, 
cause thy face to shine; 
 
and we shall be saved.

God’s Goodness and Israel’s Waywardness 
To the chief Musician upon Gittith,  
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  Sing aloud unto God our strength: 
 
make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 
2  Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, 
the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 
3  Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, 
in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.  
4  For this was a statute for Israel, 
and a law of the God of Jacob. 
5  This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, 
when he went out through the land of Egypt: 
 
where I heard a language that I understood not. 
6  I removed his shoulder from the burden: 
 
his hands were delivered from the pots. 
7  Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; 
 
I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: 
 
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.  
Selah. 
8  Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: 
 
O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; 
 
9  there shall no strange god be in thee; 
 
neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
