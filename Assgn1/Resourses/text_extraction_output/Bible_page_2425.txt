  2426    1 Corinthians 2 
25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the 
 
weakness of God is stronger than men. 
26  ¶ For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men 
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 
 
27  but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound 
the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to 
 
confound the things which are mighty; 
 
28  and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath 
God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought 
things that are: 
 
29  that no flesh should glory in his presence. 
30  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us 
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
 
31  that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the 
Lord.

Proclaiming Christ Crucified 
1  And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of 
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
2  For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus 
Christ, and him crucified. 
3  And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much 
trembling.  
4  And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of 
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
 
5  that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the 
power of God.
