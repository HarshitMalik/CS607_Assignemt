The Book of the Prophet

[Jeremiah] 
1 
Jeremiah’s Call and Commission 
1  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in 
Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
 
2  to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son 
of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
3  It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of 
Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of 
Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in 
the fifth month. 
4  ¶ Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou 
 
camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee 
a prophet unto the nations. 
6  Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a 
   
child. 
7  But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go 
 
to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou 
shalt speak. 
8  Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith 
 
the Lord. 
9  Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And 
the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. 
10  See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the 
kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to 
throw down, to build, and to plant. 
11  ¶ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, 
what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
