  43    Genesis 20 
35  And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the 
 
younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she 
 
lay down, nor when she arose. 
36  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
37  And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is 
 
the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
38  And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-
ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this 
 
day.

Abraham and Abimelech 
1  And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, 
and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
2  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and 
 
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
3  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, 
Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast 
taken; for she is a man’s wife. 
 
4  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt 
 
thou slay also a righteous nation? 
 
5  Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself 
 
said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency 
 
of my hands have I done this. 
6  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this 
in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning 
 
against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
 
7  Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he 
 
shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, 
 
know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. 
8  ¶ Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his 
servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were 
 
sore afraid.
