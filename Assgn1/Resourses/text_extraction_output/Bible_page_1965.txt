  1966    Nahum 3 
17  Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great 
grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when 
the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where 
they are. 
18  Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in 
 
the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man 
 
gathereth them. 
19  There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that 
   
hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon 
 
whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
