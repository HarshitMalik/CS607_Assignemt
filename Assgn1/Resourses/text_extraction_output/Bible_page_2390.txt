  2391    Romans 1 
12  that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual 
faith both of you and me. 
13  Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I 
purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might 
have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
14  I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the 
 
wise, and to the unwise. 
15  So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that 
are at Rome also. 
The Power of the Gospel 
16  ¶ For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of 
 
God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and 
 
also to the Greek. 
17  For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: 
 
as it is written, The just shall live by faith.  
The Guilt of Mankind 
18  ¶ For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all 
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in 
unrighteousness; 
 
19  because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for 
 
God hath showed it unto them. 
20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are 
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his 
eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
   
21  because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, 
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and 
 
their foolish heart was darkened. 
22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
23  and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image 
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, 
and creeping things.
