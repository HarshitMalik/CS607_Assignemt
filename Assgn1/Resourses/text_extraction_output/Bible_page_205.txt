  206    Exodus 33 
12  ¶ And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring 
up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt 
 
send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou 
hast also found grace in my sight. 
13  Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show 
me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy 
sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 
 
14  And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. 
15  And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not 
up hence. 
16  For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have 
found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? So 
   
shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are 
upon the face of the earth. 
17  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou 
hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee 
 
by name. 
18  And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory. 
19  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I 
will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be 
 
gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom 
I will show mercy.  
20  And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see 
 
me, and live. 
21  And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt 
stand upon a rock: 
 
22  and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put 
thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I 
pass by: 
 
23  and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts; 
 
but my face shall not be seen.
