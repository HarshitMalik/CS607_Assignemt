breaths, trying to take energy in without letting it out.
There  are  a  number  of  such  patterns.  They  can  cause
dizziness,  deafness,  reddening  of  the  eyes,  distention  of
the  abdomen,  pain  in  the  tendons  and  bones,  mental
fogginess, nocturnal emissions, and other symptoms.
People  who  lack  the  basic  capacity  tend  to  develop
illnesses  by  what  they  do  in  their  pretenses  of  practicing
Taoism.  What  they  do  not  realize  is  that  practicing  the
Way  is  cultivating  and  nurturing  the  Way  of  nature,  the
natural course.
First  it  is  essential  to  clear  the  mind  and  minimize
desires.  After  that,  you  preserve  and  nurture  the  vital
spirit.  You  may  succeed  in  prolonging  life,  or  even  in
permanent realization of wizardry or buddhahood; but the
effective result is due to inconspicuous practice according
to principle, clearing the mind and not making up anything
â€”it does not come from artificial contrivance.
Generally  speaking,  quiet  sitting  has  three  types  of
principles.  First  there  are  the  principles  on  which  higher
alchemy is based. In the middle there are the principles of
refining  the  alchemical  elixir.  Finally  there  are  the
principles of lower alchemy.
So  every  step  has  its  process.  The  order  must  be
understood,  the  principles  must  be  observed.  Even  those
who  are  sincere  and  genuine  may  be  able  to  keep  the
principles  of  preparation  and  procedure,  but  most  act
carelessly when it comes to completion.
