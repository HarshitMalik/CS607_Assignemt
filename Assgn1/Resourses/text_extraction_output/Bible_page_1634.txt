  1635    Jeremiah 11 
18  For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of 
the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so. 
19  ¶ Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly 
   
this is a grief, and I must bear it. 
20  My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children 
 
are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth 
 
my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 
21  For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord: 
 
therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be 
scattered. 
22  Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out 
of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den 
of dragons. 
23  ¶ O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in 
 
man that walketh to direct his steps. 
24  O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest 
 
thou bring me to nothing. 
25  Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon 
the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, 
 
and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his 
habitation desolate.

The Broken Covenant 
1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 
2  Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of 
Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
 
3  and say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Cursed 
 
be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, 
4  which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them 
forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey 
my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so 
 
shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
