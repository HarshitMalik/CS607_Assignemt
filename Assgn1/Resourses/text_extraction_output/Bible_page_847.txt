  848    2 Kings 7 
28  And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, 
 
This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him 
today, and we will eat my son tomorrow. 
29  So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the 
 
next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her 
 
son. 
30  And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, 
that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the 
 
people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. 
31  Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha 
the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 
32  ¶ But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the 
 
king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to 
 
him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath 
sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, 
 
shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his 
 
master’s feet behind him? 
 
33  And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came 
down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what 
   
should I wait for the Lord any longer?

1  Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the 
 
Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be 
sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate 
of Samaria. 
2  Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of 
God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in 
heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it 
 
with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 
3  ¶ And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: 
 
and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 
 
4  If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, 
and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now
