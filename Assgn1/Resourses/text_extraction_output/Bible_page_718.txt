  719    2 Samuel 12 
5  And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said 
 
to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing 
shall surely die: 
 
6  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, 
and because he had no pity. 
7  ¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the 
Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I 
delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 
 
8  and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy 
bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that 
 
had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and 
such things. 
9  Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to 
do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the 
 
sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him 
with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
10  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; 
 
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the 
Hittite to be thy wife. 
11  Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of 
thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and 
give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the 
sight of this sun. 
12  For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, 
 
and before the sun.  
13  And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And 
Nathan said unto David, the Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou 
 
shalt not die. 
14  Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the 
enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto 
thee shall surely die. 
15  And Nathan departed unto his house. 
¶ And the Lord struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, 
and it was very sick.
