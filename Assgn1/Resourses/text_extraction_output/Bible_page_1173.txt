  1174    Job 29 
18  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: 
 
for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
19  The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, 
neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
20  Whence then cometh wisdom? 
 
And where is the place of understanding? 
 
21  seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, 
and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
22  Destruction and death say, 
We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
23  God understandeth the way thereof, 
and he knoweth the place thereof. 
24  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, 
and seeth under the whole heaven; 
 
25  to make the weight for the winds; 
 
and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
26  When he made a decree for the rain, 
and a way for the lightning of the thunder; 
 
27  then did he see it, and declare it; 
 
he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
28  And unto man he said, 
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;  
 
and to depart from evil is understanding.

Job Recalls His Former Glory 
1  Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
2  Oh that I were as in months past, 
as in the days when God preserved me; 
 
3  when his candle shined upon my head, 
and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
 
4  as I was in the days of my youth, 
when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
