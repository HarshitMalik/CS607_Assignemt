  1273    Psalms 57 
in the Lord will I praise his word. 
11  In God have I put my trust: 
 
I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 
12  Thy vows are upon me, O God: 
 
I will render praises unto thee. 
13  For thou hast delivered my soul from death: 
 
wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, 
that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

A Prayer for Rescue from Persecutors 
To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when 
he fled from Saul in the cave.  
1  Be merciful unto me, O God, 
be merciful unto me:

until these calamities be overpast. 
2  I will cry unto God most high; 
 
unto God that performeth all things for me. 
3  He shall send from heaven, and save me 
from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. 
Selah. 
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

and I lie even among them that are set on fire, 
even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, 
and their tongue a sharp sword. 
5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; 
 
let thy glory be above all the earth. 
6  They have prepared a net for my steps; 
 
my soul is bowed down:
