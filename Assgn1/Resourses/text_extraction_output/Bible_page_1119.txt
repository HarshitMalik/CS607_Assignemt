also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the 
 
king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

Esther Invites the King and Haman to a Banquet 
1  Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal 
apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over 
against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in 
 
the royal house, over against the gate of the house. 
2  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the 
court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to 
 
Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, 
and touched the top of the sceptre. 
3  Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and 
 
what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the 
 
kingdom. 
4  And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and 
Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for 
him. 
5  Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as 
Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that 
Esther had prepared. 
6  And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy 
petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even 
     
to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. 
7  Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 
 
8  If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the 
king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king 
and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and 
I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.
