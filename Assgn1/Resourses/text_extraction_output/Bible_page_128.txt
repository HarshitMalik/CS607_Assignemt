  129    Exodus 3 
3  And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why 
the bush is not burnt. 
4  And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called 
unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And 
he said, Here am I. 
5  And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy 
 
feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
 
6  Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, 
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for 
 
he was afraid to look upon God. 
7  ¶ And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people 
which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their 
taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
   
8  and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the 
Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land 
and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the 
 
place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the 
Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
9  Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come 
unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the 
 
Egyptians oppress them. 
10  Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou 
mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.  
11  And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto 
Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of 
Egypt? 
 
12  And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token 
 
unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the 
 
people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
13  ¶ And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children 
of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath 
sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what 
   
shall I say unto them?
