any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. 
 
17  Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and 
rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the heathen 
that are about us. 
18  Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice 
sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store
