The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Corinthians 
[2 Corinthians] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our 
brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the 
saints which are in all Achaia: 
 
2  ¶ Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 
Paul’s Affliction 
3  ¶ Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the 
Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
 
4  who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to 
comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith 
we ourselves are comforted of God. 
5  For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also 
aboundeth by Christ. 
6  And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and 
salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings 
which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your 
 
consolation and salvation. 
7  And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers 
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. 
8  ¶ For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble 
which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, 
above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 
 
9  but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not 
trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
