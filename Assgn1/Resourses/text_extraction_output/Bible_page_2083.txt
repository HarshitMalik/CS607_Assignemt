The Leaders Plot against Jesus 
1  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he 
said unto his disciples, 
2  Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son 
of man is betrayed to be crucified. 
3  ¶ Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and 
the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was 
called Caiaphas, 
4  and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 
5  But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among 
the people. 
Jesus Anointed at Bethany 
6  ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
7  there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very 
precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.  
8  But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what 
purpose is this waste? 
 
9  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the 
poor. 
10  When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the 
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 
 
11  For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 
 
12  For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for 
my burial. 
13  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in 
the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, 
be told for a memorial of her.
