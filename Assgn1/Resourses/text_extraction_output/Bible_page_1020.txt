  1021    2 Chronicles 24 
19  Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord; 
 
and they testified against them: but they would not give ear. 
 
20  ¶ And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada 
the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus 
saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, 
that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord, he 
 
hath also forsaken you. 
21  And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the 
commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord.  
22  Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada 
his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he 
said, The Lord look upon it, and require it. 
23  ¶ And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria 
came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and 
 
destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and 
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 
24  For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, 
and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand, because 
they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed 
judgment against Joash. 
25  ¶ And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in 
great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the 
blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, 
and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they 
 
buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
26  And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of 
 
Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a 
Moabitess. 
27  Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon 
him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are 
written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son 
reigned in his stead.
