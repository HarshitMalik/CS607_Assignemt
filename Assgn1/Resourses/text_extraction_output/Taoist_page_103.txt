When  you  no  longer  flow  in  waves,  and  you  merge  with
the Way and rest in the Way, this is called returning to the
root.
Keeping to the root is called calm stabilization. After a
long time of calm stabilization, illnesses dissolve and life
is  restored.  It  is  restored  and  continued,  and  you
spontaneously  attain  knowledge  of  the  eternal.  By  virtue
of knowledge, there is no unclarity; in the eternal there is
no change and no extinction. Getting out of birth and death
actually  comes  from  this.  Therefore  to  settle  the  mind  in
the  Way  of  truth  it  is  important  not  to  be  fixated  on
anything.
Scripture says, “Things flourish, then each returns to its
root.  Returning  to  the  root  is  called  calm.  Calmness  is
called  restoring  life.  Restoring  life  is  called  constancy;
knowing  the  constant  is  called  clarity.”  If  you  grasp  the
mind and station it on emptiness, that is called having an
object;  it  is  not  called  having  no  object.  Whenever  you
dwell on an object, that causes the mind to labor; not only
is it unreasonable, it even causes sickness.
As  long  as  the  mind  does  not  stick  to  things,  and  you
can  remain  unmoved,  this  is  the  correct  foundation  for
genuine  stabilization.  If  you  stabilize  the  mind  by  this
means,  your  mood  will  become  harmonious;  the  longer
you do so, the lighter and fresher you feel. If you use this
as a test, error and truth become evident.
If  you  extinguish  the  mind  whenever  it  is  aroused,
without  distinguishing  right  from  wrong,  then  you  will
