  1252    Psalms 40 
9  I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: 
 
lo, I have not refrained my lips, 
O Lord, thou knowest. 
10  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; 
 
I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: 
 
I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth 
from the great congregation. 
11  Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: 
 
let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me. 
12  For innumerable evils have compassed me about: 
 
mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to 
look up; 
 
they are more than the hairs of mine head: 
 
therefore my heart faileth me. 
13  Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: 
 
O Lord, make haste to help me. 
14  Let them be ashamed and confounded together 
that seek after my soul to destroy it; 
 
let them be driven backward and put to shame 
that wish me evil. 
15  Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame 
that say unto me, Aha, aha. 
16  Let all those that seek thee 
rejoice and be glad in thee: 
 
let such as love thy salvation 
say continually, The Lord be magnified. 
17  But I am poor and needy; 
 
yet the Lord thinketh upon me: 
 
thou art my help and my deliverer; 
 
make no tarrying, O my God.
