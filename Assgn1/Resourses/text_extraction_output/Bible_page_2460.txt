  2461    2 Corinthians 4 
4 
1  Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, 
we faint not; 
 
2  but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking 
in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but, by 
 
manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s 
conscience in the sight of God. 
3  But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
 
4  in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them 
which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, 
who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 
5  For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and 
 
ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
6  For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath 
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory 
of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
Living by Faith 
7  ¶ But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of 
the power may be of God, and not of us. 
8  We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, 
 
but not in despair; 
 
9  persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
   
10  always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that 
the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
11  For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, 
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal 
flesh. 
12  So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
13  ¶ We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I 
believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and 
 
therefore speak;
