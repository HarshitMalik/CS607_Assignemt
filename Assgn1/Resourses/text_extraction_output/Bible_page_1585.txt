  1586    Isaiah 52 
19  These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? 
   
desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by 
 
whom shall I comfort thee? 
 
20  Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a 
wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke 
 
of thy God. 
21  ¶ Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not 
with wine: 
 
22  thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth the cause 
of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of 
trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more 
 
drink it again: 
 
23  but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have 
 
said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid 
 
thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. 
52 
God Will Deliver Zion from Captivity 
1  Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful 
 
garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no 
 
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
2  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose 
   
thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 
3  ¶ For thus saith the Lord, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and 
 
ye shall be redeemed without money. 
4  For thus saith the Lord God, My people went down aforetime into 
Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without 
 
cause. 
5  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord, that my people is 
taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to 
 
howl, saith the Lord; and my name continually every day is 
 
blasphemed.
