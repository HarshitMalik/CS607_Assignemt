  1756    Ezekiel 3 
4  For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto 
them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God. 
 
5  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for 
they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a 
prophet among them. 
6  And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of 
their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost 
dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be 
 
dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. 
7  And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, 
or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. 
 
8  ¶ But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou 
 
rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I 
 
give thee. 
9  And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll 
 
of a book was therein; 
 
10  and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: 
   
and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and 
woe. 
3 
1  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat 
 
this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
2  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
3  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy 
bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in 
 
my mouth as honey for sweetness.  
4  ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of 
Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
5  For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard 
language, but to the house of Israel; 
 
6  not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, 
whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to 
them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
