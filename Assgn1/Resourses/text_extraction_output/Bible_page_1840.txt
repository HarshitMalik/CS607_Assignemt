  1841    Ezekiel 38 
15  And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, 
and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great 
company, and a mighty army: 
 
16  and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to 
cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee 
 
against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be 
sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. 
17  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in 
 
old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in 
those days many years, that I would bring thee against them? 
 
18  And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come 
against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall 
come up in my face. 
19  For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely 
in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
 
20  so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the 
beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the 
earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall 
shake at my presence, and the mountans shall be thrown down, 
and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the 
ground. 
21  And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my 
mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against 
 
his brother. 
22  And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I 
 
will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people 
that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, 
and brimstone. 
23  Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be 
 
known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am 
the Lord.
