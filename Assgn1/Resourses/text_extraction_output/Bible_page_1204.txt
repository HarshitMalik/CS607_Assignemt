  1205    Psalms 5 
commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. 
Selah. 
5  Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, 
and put your trust in the Lord. 
6  There be many that say, Who will show us any good? 
 
Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 
7  Thou hast put gladness in my heart, 
more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. 
8  I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: 
 
for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.

A Prayer for Protection 
To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Give ear to my words, O Lord; 
 
consider my meditation. 
2  Hearken unto the voice of my cry, 
my King, and my God: 
 
for unto thee will I pray. 
3  My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; 
 
in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, 
and will look up. 
4  For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: 
 
neither shall evil dwell with thee. 
5  The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: 
 
thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
6  Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: 
 
the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
7  But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy 
mercy: 
 
and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
