  1182    Job 33 
God thrusteth him down, not man. 
14  Now he hath not directed his words against me: 
 
neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
15  They were amazed, they answered no more: 
 
they left off speaking. 
16  When I had waited, (for they spake not, 
but stood still, and answered no more,) 
17  I said, I will answer also my part; 
 
I also will show mine opinion. 
18  For I am full of matter; 
 
the spirit within me constraineth me. 
19  Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; 
 
it is ready to burst like new bottles. 
20  I will speak, that I may be refreshed: 
 
I will open my lips and answer. 
21  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person; 
 
neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 
22  For I know not to give flattering titles; 
 
in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.

Elihu Reproves Job 
1  Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, 
and hearken to all my words. 
2  Behold, now I have opened my mouth, 
my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
3  My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: 
 
and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 
4  The Spirit of God hath made me, 
and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 
5  If thou canst answer me, 
set thy words in order before me, stand up. 
6  Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead:
