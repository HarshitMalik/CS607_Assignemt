  2559    Hebrews 7 
3  without father, without mother, without descent, having neither 
beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of 
 
God; abideth a priest continually. 
 
4  ¶ Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the 
patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
5  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office 
of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the 
people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they 
come out of the loins of Abraham: 
 
6  but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of 
Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
7  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
8  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of 
 
whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
9  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in 
Abraham. 
10  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met 
him. 
11  ¶ If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for 
under it the people received the law,) what further need was there 
that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and 
not be called after the order of Aaron? 
 
12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a 
change also of the law. 
13  For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another 
tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
14  For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe 
 
Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 
15  ¶ And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of 
 
Melchizedek there ariseth another priest, 
16  who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after 
the power of an endless life. 
17  For he testifieth, 
Thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of Melchizedek.
