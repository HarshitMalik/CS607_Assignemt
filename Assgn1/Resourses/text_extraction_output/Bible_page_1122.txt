  1123    Esther 7 
14  ¶ And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s 
chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that 
Esther had prepared. 
7 
Haman Hanged 
1  So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
2  And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the 
banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be 
 
granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, 
   
even to the half of the kingdom. 
3  Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in 
thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at 
my petition, and my people at my request: 
 
4  for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to 
perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I 
had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the 
king’s damage. 
5  Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, 
Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do 
so? 
 
6  And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. 
Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. 
7  And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went 
into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for 
 
his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil 
 
determined against him by the king. 
8  Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of 
the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon 
 
Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before 
me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they 
 
covered Haman’s face.
