  20    Genesis 9 
17  Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all 
flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the 
 
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
18  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ 
wives with him: 
 
19  every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever 
creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the 
ark. 
20  ¶ And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every 
 
clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on 
the altar. 
21  And the Lord smelled a sweet savor; and the Lord said in his 
 
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; 
 
for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth: neither 
 
will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 
22  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and 
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

God’s Covenant with Noah 
1  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be 
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.  
2  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast 
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth 
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are 
 
they delivered. 
3  Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the 
 
green herb have I given you all things. 
4  But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye 
not eat.
