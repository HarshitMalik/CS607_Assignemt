The Land to Be Divided by Lot 
52  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
53  Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to 
the number of names. 
54  To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou 
shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be 
 
given according to those that were numbered of him. 
55  Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the 
 
names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit. 
56  According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between 
many and few.
