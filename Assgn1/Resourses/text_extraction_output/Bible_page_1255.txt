  1256    Psalms 44 
44 
Former Deliverances and Present Troubles 
To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. 
1  We have heard with our ears, O God, 
our fathers have told us, 
what work thou didst in their days, 
in the times of old. 
2  How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, 
and plantedst them; 
 
how thou didst afflict the people, 
and cast them out. 
3  For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, 
neither did their own arm save them: 
 
but thy right hand, and thine arm, 
and the light of thy countenance, 
because thou hadst a favor unto them. 
4  Thou art my King, O God: 
 
command deliverances for Jacob. 
5  Through thee will we push down our enemies: 
 
through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. 
6  For I will not trust in my bow, 
neither shall my sword save me. 
7  But thou hast saved us from our enemies, 
and hast put them to shame that hated us. 
8  In God we boast all the day long, 
and praise thy name for ever. 
Selah. 
9  But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; 
 
and goest not forth with our armies. 
10  Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: 
 
and they which hate us spoil for themselves. 
11  Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat;
