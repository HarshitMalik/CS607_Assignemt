  2007    Malachi 3 
The Payment of Tithes 
6  ¶ For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are 
 
not consumed. 
7  Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine 
ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will 
return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein 
shall we return? 
 
8  Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein 
 
have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
 
9  Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole 
 
nation. 
10  Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat 
in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of 
hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you 
out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. 
11  And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not 
destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her 
 
fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. 
12  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome 
 
land, saith the Lord of hosts. 
The Distinction between the Righteous and the Wicked 
13  ¶ Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye 
say, What have we spoken so much against thee? 
 
14  Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we 
 
have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully 
before the Lord of hosts? 
 
15  And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness 
 
are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. 
 
16  ¶ Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and 
 
the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was 
written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that 
thought upon his name.
