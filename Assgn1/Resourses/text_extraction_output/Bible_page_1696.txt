burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many 
 
like words. 
37 
Jeremiah Imprisoned 
1  And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the 
son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made 
king in the land of Judah.  
2  But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did 
hearken unto the words of the Lord, which he spake by the 
prophet Jeremiah. 
3  ¶ And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and 
Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, 
saying, Pray now unto the Lord our God for us. 
4  Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they 
 
had not put him into prison. 
5  Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the 
 
Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they 
departed from Jerusalem. 
6  ¶ Then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah, 
saying, 
7  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the 
 
king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, 
 
Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to 
Egypt into their own land. 
8  And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and 
take it, and burn it with fire. 
9  Thus saith the Lord; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The 
 
Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart. 
 
10  For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that 
fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among 
them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this 
city with fire.
