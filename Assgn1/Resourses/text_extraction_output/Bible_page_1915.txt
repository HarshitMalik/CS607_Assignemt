abominations were according as they loved. 
11  As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, 
and from the womb, and from the conception. 
12  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that 
there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart 
 
from them! 
 
13  Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim 
 
shall bring forth his children to the murderer. 
14  Give them, O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying 
   
womb and dry breasts. 
15  ¶ All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the 
   
wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I 
will love them no more: all their princes are revolters. 
 
16  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: 
 
yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of 
their womb. 
17  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto 
him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly 
images. 
2  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall 
   
break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. 
3  ¶ For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not 
the Lord; what then should a king do to us? 
   
4  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: 
 
thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
5  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-
aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests
