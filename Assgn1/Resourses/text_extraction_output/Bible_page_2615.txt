  2616    Revelation 1 
A Vision of the Son of Man 
9  ¶ I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, 
and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that 
is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus 
Christ. 
10  I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great 
voice, as of a trumpet, 
11  saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What 
 
thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches 
which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto 
 
Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto 
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 
12  ¶ And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being 
turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
 
13  and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of 
man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the 
paps with a golden girdle.  
14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and 
 
his eyes were as a flame of fire; 
 
15  and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and 
 
his voice as the sound of many waters.  
16  And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth 
 
went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun 
 
shineth in his strength. 
17  ¶ And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his 
right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and 
 
the last:  
 
18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for 
 
evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 
 
19  Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, 
and the things which shall be hereafter; 
 
20  the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, 
and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of
