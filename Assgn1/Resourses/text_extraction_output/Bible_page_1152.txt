  1153    Job 15 
22  But his flesh upon him shall have pain, 
and his soul within him shall mourn.

Eliphaz Reprimands Job 
1  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
2  Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, 
and fill his belly with the east wind? 
 
3  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? 
 
or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 
 
4  Yea, thou castest off fear, 
and restrainest prayer before God. 
5  For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, 
and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 
6  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: 
 
yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 
7  Art thou the first man that was born? 
 
Or wast thou made before the hills? 
 
8  Hast thou heard the secret of God? 
 
And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 
 
9  What knowest thou, that we know not? 
 
What understandest thou, which is not in us? 
 
10  With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, 
much elder than thy father. 
11  Are the consolations of God small with thee? 
 
Is there any secret thing with thee? 
 
12  Why doth thine heart carry thee away? 
 
And what do thy eyes wink at, 
13  that thou turnest thy spirit against God, 
and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? 
 
14  What is man, that he should be clean? 
 
and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
 
15  Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints;
