  2074    Matthew 23 
39  And the second is like unto it, 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  
40  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  
The Question about David’s Son 
41  ¶ While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
42  saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto 
   
him, The son of David. 
43  He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, 
saying, 
44  The Lord said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, 
till I make thine enemies thy footstool? 
 
45  If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? 
 
46  And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man 
from that day forth ask him any more questions.

Jesus Denounces the Scribes and Pharisees 
1  Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
2  saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: 
 
3  all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; 
 
but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. 
 
4  For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them 
on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with 
 
one of their fingers. 
5  But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad 
 
their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, 
6  and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the 
synagogues, 
7  and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
