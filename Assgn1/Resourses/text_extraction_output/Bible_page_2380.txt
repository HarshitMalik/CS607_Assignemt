  2381    Acts 26 
9  ¶ I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things 
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
10  Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I 
 
shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; 
 
and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 
11  And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them 
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I 
 
persecuted them even unto strange cities.  
Paul Tells of His Conversion 
12  ¶ Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and 
commission from the chief priests, 
13  at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the 
brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which 
journeyed with me. 
14  And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking 
unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
 
15  And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom 
 
thou persecutest. 
16  But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for 
 
this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these 
things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will 
appear unto thee; 
 
17  delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom 
now I send thee, 
18  to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from 
the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of 
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that 
is in me.
