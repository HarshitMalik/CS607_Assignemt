  196    Exodus 29 
36  And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for 
atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made 
 
an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
37  Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify 
it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar 
   
shall be holy. 
The Daily Offerings 
38  ¶ Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs 
 
of the first year day by day continually. 
39  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb 
 
thou shalt offer at even: 
 
40  and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the 
fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of 
 
wine for a drink offering. 
41  And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto 
according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the 
drink offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire 
unto the Lord. 
42  This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations 
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, 
where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 
43  And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle 
shall be sanctified by my glory. 
44  And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the 
altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me 
 
in the priest’s office. 
45  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their 
God. 
46  And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, that brought 
them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: 
 
I am the Lord their God.
