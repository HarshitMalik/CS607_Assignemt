  556    Judges 2 
The Extent of the Conquests of the Other Tribes 
30  ¶ Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the 
inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and 
 
became tributaries. 
31  ¶ Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the 
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, 
nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 
 
32  but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of 
the land: for they did not drive them out. 
 
33  ¶ Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, 
nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the 
 
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the 
 
inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries 
unto them. 
34  ¶ And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: 
 
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 
 
35  but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in 
Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that 
 
they became tributaries. 
36  And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, 
from the rock, and upward. 
2 
The Angel of the Lord at Bochim 
1  And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and 
said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto 
the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never 
 
break my covenant with you. 
2  And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye 
 
shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice; 
   
why have ye done this?
