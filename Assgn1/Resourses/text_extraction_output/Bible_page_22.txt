  23    Genesis 10 
10 
The Descendants of the Sons of Noah 
1  Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, 
 
and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 
 
2  ¶ The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, 
 
and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
3  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
 
4  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and 
 
Dodanim. 
5  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every 
 
one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
6  ¶ And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and 
 
Canaan. 
7  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, 
 
and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
   
8  And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
 
9  He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, 
 
Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. 
10  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and 
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
11  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the 
city Rehoboth, and Calah, 
12  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 
 
13  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and 
Naphtuhim, 
14  and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and 
Caphtorim. 
15  ¶ And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 
16  and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, 
17  and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
18  and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and 
 
afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
