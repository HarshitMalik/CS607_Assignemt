  1871    Daniel 1 
10  And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the 
king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why 
 
should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of 
your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. 
 
11  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had 
set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
12  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us 
 
pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
13  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the 
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s 
meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
 
14  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 
15  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and 
fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the 
king’s meat. 
16  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that 
they should drink; and gave them pulse. 
 
17  ¶ As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in 
all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all 
 
visions and dreams. 
18  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring 
them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before 
Nebuchadnezzar. 
19  And the king communed with them; and among them all was 
 
found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
 
therefore stood they before the king. 
20  And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king 
inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the 
magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. 
21  And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
