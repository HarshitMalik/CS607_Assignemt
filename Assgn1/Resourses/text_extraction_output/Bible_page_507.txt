  508    Joshua 7 
9  For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of 
it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: 
 
and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 
 
10  ¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest 
 
thou thus upon thy face? 
 
11  Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant 
which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the 
 
accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they 
have put it even among their own stuff. 
12  Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their 
enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they 
were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye 
 
destroy the accursed from among you. 
13  Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against 
tomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an 
 
accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand 
 
before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from 
among you. 
14  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your 
tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord taketh shall 
 
come according to the families thereof; and the family which the 
 
Lord shall take shall come by households; and the household 
 
which the Lord shall take shall come man by man. 
15  And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be 
burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath 
 
transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath 
wrought folly in Israel. 
16  ¶ So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by 
their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
   
17  and he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the 
 
Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; 
   
and Zabdi was taken: 
 
18  and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of 
 
Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was 
taken.
