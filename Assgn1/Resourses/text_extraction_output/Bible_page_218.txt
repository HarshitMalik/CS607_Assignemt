  219    Exodus 38 
The Court of the Tabernacle 
9  Â¶ And he made the court: on the south side southward the 
 
hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits: 
 
10  their pillars were twenty, and their brazen sockets twenty; the 
 
hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
11  And for the north side the hangings were a hundred cubits, their 
pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of 
 
the pillars and their fillets of silver. 
12  And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, 
and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of 
 
silver. 
13  And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
14  The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their 
 
pillars three, and their sockets three. 
15  And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that 
hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their 
 
sockets three. 
16  All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 
17  And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars 
 
and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of 
 
silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
 
18  And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, 
and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits 
 
was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, 
answerable to the hangings of the court. 
19  And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their 
 
hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets 
of silver. 
20  And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, 
were of brass.
