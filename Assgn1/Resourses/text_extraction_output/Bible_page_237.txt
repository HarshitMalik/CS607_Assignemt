  238    Leviticus 6 
give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass 
offering. 
6  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, a ram 
without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass 
offering, unto the priest: 
 
7  and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord: 
 
and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in 
trespassing therein.  
The Law of the Offerings 
8  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
9  Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt 
offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the 
 
altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be 
burning in it. 
10  And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen 
breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which 
the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he 
shall put them beside the altar. 
11  And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and 
carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
12  And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put 
 
out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay 
 
the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the 
 
fat of the peace offerings. 
13  The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out. 
 
14  ¶ And this is the law of the meat offering: The sons of Aaron shall 
 
offer it before the Lord, before the altar. 
15  And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, 
and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the 
meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, even 
the memorial of it, unto the Lord.
