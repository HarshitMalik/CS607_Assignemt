18  And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which 
reigneth over the kings of the earth.

The Fall of Babylon 
1  And after these things I saw another angel come down from 
heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his 
 
glory. 
2  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the 
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and 
the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and 
hateful bird.  
3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication 
with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through 
the abundance of her delicacies. 
4  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, 
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive 
not of her plagues. 
5  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered 
her iniquities. 
6  Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double 
according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her 
 
double. 
7  How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so 
much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a 
 
queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. 
8  Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, 
and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is 
   
the Lord God who judgeth her. 
9  Â¶ And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and 
lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, 
when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
