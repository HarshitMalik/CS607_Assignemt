  568    Judges 6 
10  and I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of 
 
the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my 
 
voice. 
11  ¶ And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak 
which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and 
 
his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the 
Midianites. 
12  And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, 
The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. 
13  And Gideon said unto him, O my Lord, if the Lord be with us, 
why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which 
 
our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from 
Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into 
 
the hands of the Midianites. 
14  And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, 
and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have 
 
not I sent thee? 
 
15  And he said unto him, O my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? 
 
behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my 
father’s house. 
16  And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou 
shalt smite the Midianites as one man. 
17  And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then 
show me a sign that thou talkest with me. 
18  Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring 
forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry 
until thou come again. 
19  ¶ And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes 
of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the 
 
broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and 
presented it. 
20  And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the 
unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the 
broth. And he did so.
