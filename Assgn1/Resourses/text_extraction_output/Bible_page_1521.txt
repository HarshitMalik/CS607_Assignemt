  1522    Isaiah 18 
9  ¶ In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an 
uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: 
 
and there shall be desolation. 
10  Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not 
been mindful of the Rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou 
plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 
 
11  in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning 
shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap 
 
in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow. 
12  ¶ Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the 
noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing 
 
like the rushing of mighty waters! 
 
13  The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God 
 
shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as 
the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing 
before the whirlwind. 
14  And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is 
 
not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them 
that rob us.

A Prophecy concerning Ethiopia 
1  Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers 
of Ethiopia:  
 
2  that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes 
upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation 
scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning 
hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the 
 
rivers have spoiled! 
 
3  All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, 
when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he 
 
bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
