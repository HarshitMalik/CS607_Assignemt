  1929    Joel 3 
17  So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, 
my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no 
 
strangers pass through her any more. 
18  Â¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall 
drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the 
rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come 
forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of 
Shittim. 
19  Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate 
wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because 
they have shed innocent blood in their land. 
20  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to 
generation. 
21  For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord 
 
dwelleth in Zion.
