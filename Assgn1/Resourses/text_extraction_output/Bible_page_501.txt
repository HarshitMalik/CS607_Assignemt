  502    Joshua 5 
15  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, 
16  Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they 
come up out of Jordan. 
17  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of 
Jordan. 
18  And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the 
covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and 
the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that 
the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all 
his banks, as they did before. 
19  ¶ And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first 
month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. 
20  And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua 
pitch in Gilgal. 
21  And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your 
children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean 
these stones? 
 
22  then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this 
Jordan on dry land. 
23  For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before 
you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the 
Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone 
over: 
 
24  that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, 
that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.

on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, 
which were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters 
of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed
