  974    2 Chronicles 1 
10  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come 
in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so 
 
great? 
 
11  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and 
thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thine 
enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom 
 
and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over 
whom I have made thee king: 
 
12  wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee 
 
riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had 
that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have 
the like. 
13  Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at 
Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and reigned over Israel. 
Solomon’s Trade in Horses and Chariots 
14  ¶ And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a 
 
thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand 
horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king 
at Jerusalem. 
15  And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as 
stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the 
vale for abundance. 
16  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the 
 
king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
17  And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for 
six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: 
 
and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and 
for the kings of Syria, by their means.
