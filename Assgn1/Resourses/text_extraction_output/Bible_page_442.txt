  443    Deuteronomy 14 
5  the hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, 
and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 
6  And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into 
two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. 
7  Nevertheless these ye shall not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of 
them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and 
 
the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore 
   
they are unclean unto you. 
8  And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the 
cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch 
 
their dead carcass. 
9  ¶ These ye shall eat, of all that are in the waters: all that have fins 
 
and scales shall ye eat: 
 
10  and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is 
 
unclean unto you. 
11  ¶ Of all clean birds ye shall eat. 
12  But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the 
 
ossifrage, and the ospray, 
13  and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 
14  and every raven after his kind, 
15  and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk 
after his kind, 
16  the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
17  and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant, 
18  and the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and 
the bat. 
19  And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall 
 
not be eaten. 
20  But of all clean fowls ye may eat. 
21  ¶ Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it 
 
unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou 
 
mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art a holy people unto the 
 
Lord thy God. 
¶ Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.
