  2485    Galatians 5 
5 
Stand Fast in Liberty 
1  Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us 
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 
2  ¶ Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall 
profit you nothing. 
3  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a 
debtor to do the whole law. 
4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are 
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 
 
5  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by 
faith. 
6  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor 
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
 
7  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the 
 
truth? 
 
8  This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. 
9  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.  
10  I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none 
otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his 
 
judgment, whosoever he be. 
11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer 
persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased. 
 
12  I would they were even cut off which trouble you. 
13  ¶ For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not 
 
liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 
14  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love 
 
thy neighbor as thyself.  
15  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not 
consumed one of another.
