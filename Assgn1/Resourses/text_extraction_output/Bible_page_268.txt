and for the altar: and he shall make an atonement for the priests, 
 
and for all the people of the congregation.

atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.

One Place of Sacrifice 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of 
Israel, and say unto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath 
commanded, saying, 
3  What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, 
or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 
4  and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the 
tabernacle of the Lord; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he 
   
hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his 
 
people: 
 
5  to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, 
which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them 
unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings 
unto the Lord. 
6  And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord 
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat 
for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
7  And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after 
whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever 
unto them throughout their generations. 
8  Â¶ And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the 
house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that 
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
