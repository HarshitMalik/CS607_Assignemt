  1133    Job 3 
12  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they 
lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, 
 
and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
13  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven 
nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief 
 
was very great.

Job Bewails His Birth 
1  After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.  
2  And Job spake, and said, 
3  Let the day perish wherein I was born, 
and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
4  Let that day be darkness; 
 
let not God regard it from above, 
neither let the light shine upon it. 
5  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; 
 
let a cloud dwell upon it; 
 
let the blackness of the day terrify it. 
6  As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; 
 
let it not be joined unto the days of the year; 
 
let it not come into the number of the months. 
7  Lo, let that night be solitary; 
 
let no joyful voice come therein. 
8  Let them curse it that curse the day, 
who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
9  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; 
 
let it look for light, but have none; 
 
neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
 
10  because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, 
nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
11  Why died I not from the womb? 
 
Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
