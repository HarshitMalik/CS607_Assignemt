  872    2 Kings 15 
The Reign of Pekahiah 
23  ¶ In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of 
Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two 
years. 
24  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed 
 
not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to 
sin. 
25  But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against 
him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, 
with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: 
 
and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 
26  And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, 
they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
The Reign of Pekah 
27  ¶ In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the 
son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned 
twenty years. 
28  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed 
 
not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to 
sin. 
29  ¶ In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of 
Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and 
Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of 
Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 
30  And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the 
son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his 
stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
31  And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they 
are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
