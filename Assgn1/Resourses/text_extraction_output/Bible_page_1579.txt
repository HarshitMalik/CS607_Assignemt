  1580    Isaiah 49 
17  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am 
 
the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth 
thee by the way that thou shouldest go. 
18  O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy 
 
peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
 
19  thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels 
like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor 
 
destroyed from before me. 
20  ¶ Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice 
of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; 
 
say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob. 
21  And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he 
 
caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock 
 
also, and the waters gushed out. 
22  There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.  
49 
Israel the Lord’s Servant 
1  Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The 
   
Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my 
 
mother hath he made mention of my name. 
2  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of 
 
his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his 
 
quiver hath he hid me; 
 
3  and said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be 
glorified. 
4  Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for 
nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and 
 
my work with my God. 
5  ¶ And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his 
servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not 
gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my 
God shall be my strength.
