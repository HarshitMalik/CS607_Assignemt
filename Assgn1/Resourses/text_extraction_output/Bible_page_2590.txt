all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ: to whom be praise 
 
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
Suffering as a Christian 
12  ¶ Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to 
try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 
 
13  but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, 
 
when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with 
exceeding joy. 
14  If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the 
 
Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil 
 
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 
15  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an 
evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters. 
16  Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let 
 
him glorify God on this behalf. 
17  For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: 
 
and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not 
the gospel of God? 
 
18  And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and 
the sinner appear?  
 
19  Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God 
commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a 
faithful Creator.

and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the 
glory that shall be revealed:
