  2101    Mark 2 
The Call of Levi 
13  ¶ And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude 
 
resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
14  And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the 
receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and 
followed him. 
15  ¶ And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many 
publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; 
 
for there were many, and they followed him. 
16  And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and 
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and 
drinketh with publicans and sinners? 
 
17  When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have 
no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call 
 
the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 
The Question about Fasting 
18  ¶ And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and 
 
they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of 
the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
 
19  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber 
fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the 
 
bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
20  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away 
from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 
21  No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; else 
 
the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the 
rent is made worse. 
22  And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine 
 
doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will 
be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
