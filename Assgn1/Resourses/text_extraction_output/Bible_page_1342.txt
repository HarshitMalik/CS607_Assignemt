  1343    Psalms 105 
28  He sent darkness, and made it dark;  
 
and they rebelled not against his word. 
29  He turned their waters into blood, 
and slew their fish.  
30  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, 
in the chambers of their kings.  
31  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,  
and lice in all their coasts.  
32  He gave them hail for rain, 
and flaming fire in their land. 
33  He smote their vines also and their fig trees; 
 
and brake the trees of their coasts.  
34  He spake, and the locusts came, 
and caterpillars, and that without number, 
35  and did eat up all the herbs in their land, 
and devoured the fruit of their ground.  
36  He smote also all the firstborn in their land, 
the chief of all their strength.  
37  He brought them forth also with silver and gold: 
 
and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 
38  Egypt was glad when they departed: 
 
for the fear of them fell upon them.  
39  He spread a cloud for a covering; 
 
and fire to give light in the night.  
40  The people asked, and he brought quails, 
and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.  
41  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; 
 
they ran in the dry places like a river.  
42  For he remembered his holy promise, 
and Abraham his servant. 
43  And he brought forth his people with joy, 
and his chosen with gladness: 
 
44  and gave them the lands of the heathen:  
 
and they inherited the labor of the people; 
 
45  that they might observe his statutes,
