  41    Genesis 19 
11  And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with 
blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to 
 
find the door. 
12  ¶ And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-
 
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in 
the city, bring them out of this place: 
 
13  for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen 
great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to 
 
destroy it. 
14  And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married 
his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord 
 
will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his 
sons-in-law. 
15  ¶ And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, 
saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; 
 
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
16  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon 
the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the 
 
Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and 
 
set him without the city.  
17  And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, 
that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay 
 
thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be 
 
consumed. 
18  And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 
 
19  behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou 
hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in 
saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil 
 
take me, and I die: 
 
20  behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: O, let 
 
me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
 
21  And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this 
thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou 
hast spoken.
