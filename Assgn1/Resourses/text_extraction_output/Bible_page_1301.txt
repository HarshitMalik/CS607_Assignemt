  1302    Psalms 77 
77 
Comfort from Recalling Godâ€™s Mighty Deeds 
To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun,  
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  I cried unto God with my voice, 
even unto God with my voice; 
 
and he gave ear unto me. 
2  In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: 
 
my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: 
 
my soul refused to be comforted. 
3  I remembered God, and was troubled: 
 
I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. 
Selah. 
4  Thou holdest mine eyes waking: 
 
I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
5  I have considered the days of old, 
the years of ancient times. 
6  I call to remembrance my song in the night: 
 
I commune with mine own heart: 
 
and my spirit made diligent search. 
7  Will the Lord cast off for ever? 
 
And will he be favorable no more? 
 
8  Is his mercy clean gone for ever? 
 
Doth his promise fail for evermore? 
 
9  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? 
 
Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? 
 
Selah. 
10  And I said, This is my infirmity: 
 
but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. 
11  I will remember the works of the Lord: 
 
surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 
12  I will meditate also of all thy work,
