  1569    Isaiah 43 
3  For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I 
 
gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee. 
4  Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, 
and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and 
 
people for thy life. 
5  Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and 
   
gather thee from the west: 
 
6  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: 
   
bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the 
earth; 
 
7  even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for 
 
my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. 
 
8  ¶ Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that 
have ears. 
9  Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be 
assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former 
 
things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be 
 
justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. 
 
10  Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have 
chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I 
 
am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be 
 
after me. 
11  I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. 
 
12  I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there was 
no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the 
 
Lord, that I am God. 
13  Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver 
 
out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? 
   
14  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For 
 
your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their 
nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. 
15  I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King. 
16  Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in 
the mighty waters;
