  450    Deuteronomy 17 
6  At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is 
worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he 
 
shall not be put to death.  
7  The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to 
death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put 
the evil away from among you. 
8  ¶ If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between 
blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and 
stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt 
 
thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy God 
shall choose; 
 
9  and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the 
judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show 
 
thee the sentence of judgment: 
 
10  and thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that 
place which the Lord shall choose shall show thee; and thou shalt 
 
observe to do according to all that they inform thee: 
 
11  according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, 
and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt 
do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall show 
 
thee, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
12  And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken 
unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy 
God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put 
 
away the evil from Israel. 
13  And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more 
presumptuously. 
Instructions concerning a King 
14  ¶ When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God 
giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt 
say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about 
me;
