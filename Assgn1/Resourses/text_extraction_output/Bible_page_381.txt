  382    Numbers 28 
7  And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for 
the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to 
 
be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering. 
8  And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of 
 
the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a 
sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
The Sabbath and Monthly Offerings 
9  ¶ And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, 
and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, 
and the drink offering thereof: 
 
10  this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual 
burnt offering, and his drink offering.  
11  ¶ And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt 
offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven 
 
lambs of the first year without spot; 
 
12  and three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, 
for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, 
 
mingled with oil, for one ram; 
 
13  and a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering 
unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor, a sacrifice 
 
made by fire unto the Lord. 
14  And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine unto a bullock, 
and the third part of a hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of a hin 
unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout 
 
the months of the year. 
15  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord shall be 
offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. 
The Offerings at the Appointed Feasts 
16  ¶ And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the 
Lord.
