17  even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-
gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their 
 
kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. 
18  Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
19  There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, 
save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in 
 
battle. 
20  For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should 
come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, 
and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, 
as the Lord commanded Moses.  
21  Â¶ And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the 
mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the 
mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua 
 
destroyed them utterly with their cities. 
22  There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of 
Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. 
 
23  So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord said 
unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel 
 
according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested 
from war.

The Kings Defeated by Moses 
1  Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel 
smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the 
rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and 
all the plain on the east: 
 
2  Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from 
Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the 
middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river 
Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
