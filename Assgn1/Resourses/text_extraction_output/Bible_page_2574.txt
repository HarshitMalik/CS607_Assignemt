The General Epistle of 
James 
[James] 
1 
Salutation 
1  James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
¶ To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, 
¶ Greeting. 
Faith and Humility 
2  ¶ My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 
 
3  knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
4  But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and 
entire, wanting nothing. 
5  ¶ If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all 
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 
 
6  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is 
 
like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
7  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the 
Lord. 
8  A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. 
9  ¶ Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 
 
10  but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the 
 
grass he shall pass away. 
11  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth 
the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the 
fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his 
 
ways.
