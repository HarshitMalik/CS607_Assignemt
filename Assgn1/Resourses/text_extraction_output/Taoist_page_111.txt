Then you will know the command of heaven. Action is
created  by  you  yourself,  life  is  bestowed  by  heaven.  The
relationship  of  action  and  life  is  like  shadow  and  echo
following  form  and  sound;  they  cannot  be  avoided  and
should not be resented. Only the wise realize this; pleased
with  heaven,  acknowledging  celestial  order,  they  do  not
worry; so how can poverty trouble them?
Chuang-tzu  said,  “Action  enters  but  should  not  be
kept.”  It  is  because  of  your  own  action  that  you  are
afflicted with poverty; though it has come in, it should not
be kept around. Scripture says, “Heaven and earth cannot
change  one’s  conduct,  yin  and  yang  cannot  divert  their
action.”  Speaking  in  these  terms,  this  is  true  fate,  not
something artificial; what is there to resent?
When a courageous warrior encounters brigands, he has
no  fear;  wielding  his  sword,  he  proceeds  straight  ahead,
whereupon the brigands all scatter. Once his achievement
is  established,  his  glory  and  his  reward  continue  all  his
life. Now, if poverty and sickness afflict our bodies, then
these  are  brigands.  If  we  have  a  stilled  mind,  that  is  the
courageous  warrior;  intelligent  examination  is  wielding
the  sword,  the  dissolution  of  afflictions  and  troubles  is
victory in war, and peace and permanent happiness are the
glory and the reward.
Whenever misery oppresses our minds, if we fail to use
this  observation  and  instead  become  anxious  and
burdened, then that is like people who encounter brigands
but  do  no  worthy  deeds,  throwing  off  their  armor,
