  824    1 Kings 21 
shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion 
found him, and slew him. 
37  Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And 
the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him. 
38  So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and 
disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
39  And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy 
 
servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man 
 
turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: 
 
if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or 
else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
40  And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the 
king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast 
 
decided it. 
41  And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king 
 
of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. 
42  And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let 
go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, 
therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
43  And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and 
came to Samaria.

Ahab and Nabothâ€™s Vineyard 
1  And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite 
had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab 
king of Samaria. 
2  And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I 
may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: 
 
and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem 
 
good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
3  And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should 
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
