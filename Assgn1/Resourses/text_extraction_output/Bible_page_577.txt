  578    Judges 9 
16  ¶ Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have 
made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and 
his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of 
his hands: 
 
17  (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and 
delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 
 
18  and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have 
slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and 
have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the 
men of Shechem, because he is your brother:) 
 
19  if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his 
house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice 
in you: 
 
20  but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of 
Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the 
 
men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour 
Abimelech. 
21  And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, 
for fear of Abimelech his brother. 
22  ¶ When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 
23  then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of 
Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with 
 
Abimelech: 
 
24  that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal 
might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, 
which slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him 
in the killing of his brethren. 
25  And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the 
mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: 
 
and it was told Abimelech. 
26  ¶ And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over 
to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
 
27  And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, 
and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of 
their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
