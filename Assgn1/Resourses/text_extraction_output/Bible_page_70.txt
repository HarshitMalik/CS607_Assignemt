  71    Genesis 30 
18  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given 
my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar [an 
 
hire]. 
19  And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
20  And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will 
 
my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and 
 
she called his name Zebulun [dwelling]. 
21  And afterward she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
22  And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and 
opened her womb. 
23  And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away 
 
my reproach: 
 
24  and she called his name Joseph [adding]; and said, The Lord shall 
 
add to me another son. 
The Trickery of Laban and Jacob 
25  Â¶ And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob 
said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own 
place, and to my country. 
26  Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, 
and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. 
 
27  And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine 
eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath 
 
blessed me for thy sake. 
28  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. 
29  And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and 
how thy cattle was with me. 
30  For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now 
increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since 
 
my coming: and now, when shall I provide for mine own house 
 
also? 
 
31  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not 
 
give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again 
 
feed and keep thy flock.
