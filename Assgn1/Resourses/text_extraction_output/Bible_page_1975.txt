upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation 
   
shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work. 
 
15  This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, 
I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, 
 
a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall 
 
hiss, and wag his hand.

Jerusalem’s Sin and Redemption 
1  Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! 
 
2  She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted 
   
not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God. 
 
3  Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening 
 
wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. 
 
4  Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have 
 
polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. 
5  The just Lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every 
   
morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but 
 
the unjust knoweth no shame. 
6  ¶ I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their 
   
streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so 
 
that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 
7  I said, Surely, thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so 
 
their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: 
 
but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings. 
8  ¶ Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I 
rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, 
 
that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine 
indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be 
 
devoured with the fire of my jealousy. 
9  ¶ For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may 
all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.
