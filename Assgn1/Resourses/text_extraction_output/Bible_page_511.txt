  512    Joshua 8 
25  And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, 
were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. 
26  For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the 
spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
27  Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto 
themselves, according unto the word of the Lord which he 
commanded Joshua. 
28  And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation 
unto this day. 
29  And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon 
 
as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his 
carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of 
the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth 
unto this day. 
The Law Recorded at Mount Ebal 
30  Â¶ Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount 
Ebal, 
31  as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of 
Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of 
whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they 
 
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed 
peace offerings. 
32  And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, 
which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  
33  And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood 
on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, 
which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the 
stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over 
 
against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; 
 
as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that 
they should bless the people of Israel. 
34  And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and 
cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
