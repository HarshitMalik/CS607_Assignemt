  1486    Song of Solomon 5 
a well of living waters, 
and streams from Lebanon. 
16  Awake, O north wind; 
 
and come, thou south; 
 
blow upon my garden, 
that the spices thereof may flow out. 
Let my beloved come into his garden, 
and eat his pleasant fruits. 
5 
1  I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: 
 
I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; 
 
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; 
 
I have drunk my wine with my milk. 
Eat, O friends; drink, 
 
yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
The Distress of Separation 
2  I sleep, but my heart waketh: 
 
it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, 
Open to me, my sister, my love, 
my dove, my undefiled: 
 
for my head is filled with dew, 
and my locks with the drops of the night. 
3  I have put off my coat; 
 
how shall I put it on? 
 
I have washed my feet; 
 
how shall I defile them? 
 
4  My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, 
and my bowels were moved for him. 
5  I rose up to open to my beloved; 
 
and my hands dropped with myrrh, 
and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh,
