  1458    Proverbs 30 
yea, four which I know not: 
 
19  the way of an eagle in the air; 
 
the way of a serpent upon a rock; 
 
the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; 
 
and the way of a man with a maid. 
20  Such is the way of an adulterous woman; 
 
she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, 
and saith, I have done no wickedness. 
21  For three things the earth is disquieted, 
and for four which it cannot bear: 
 
22  for a servant when he reigneth; 
 
and a fool when he is filled with meat; 
 
23  for an odious woman when she is married; 
 
and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 
24  There be four things which are little upon the earth, 
but they are exceeding wise: 
 
25  the ants are a people not strong, 
yet they prepare their meat in the summer; 
 
26  the conies are but a feeble folk, 
yet make they their houses in the rocks; 
 
27  the locusts have no king, 
yet go they forth all of them by bands; 
 
28  the spider taketh hold with her hands, 
and is in kingsâ€™ palaces. 
29  There be three things which go well, 
yea, four are comely in going: 
 
30  a lion, which is strongest among beasts, 
and turneth not away for any; 
 
31  a greyhound; a he goat also; 
   
and a king, against whom there is no rising up. 
32  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, 
or if thou hast thought evil, 
lay thine hand upon thy mouth. 
33  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, 
and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
