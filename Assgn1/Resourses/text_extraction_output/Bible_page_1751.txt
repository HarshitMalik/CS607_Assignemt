  1752    Lamentations 5 
11  They ravished the women in Zion, 
and the maids in the cities of Judah. 
12  Princes are hanged up by their hand: 
 
the faces of elders were not honored. 
13  They took the young men to grind, 
and the children fell under the wood. 
14  The elders have ceased from the gate, 
the young men from their music. 
15  The joy of our heart is ceased; 
 
our dance is turned into mourning. 
16  The crown is fallen from our head: 
 
woe unto us, that we have sinned! 
 
17  For this our heart is faint; 
 
for these things our eyes are dim. 
18  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, 
the foxes walk upon it. 
19  Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; 
 
thy throne from generation to generation. 
20  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, 
and forsake us so long time? 
 
21  Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; 
 
renew our days as of old. 
22  But thou hast utterly rejected us; 
 
thou art very wroth against us.
