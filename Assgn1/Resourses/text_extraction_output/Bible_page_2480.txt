  2481    Galatians 3 
5  He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh 
miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the 
hearing of faith? 
 
God’s Covenant with Abraham 
6  ¶ Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for 
righteousness.  
7  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the 
children of Abraham.  
8  And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen 
through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In 
thee shall all nations be blessed.  
9  So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
10  ¶ For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for 
 
it is written, 
Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things 
which are written in the book of the law to do them.  
11  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is 
evident: for, The just shall live by faith.  
 
12  And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live 
 
in them.  
13  Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a 
curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a 
 
tree:  
 
14  that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through 
Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit 
 
through faith. 
15  ¶ Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a 
 
man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or 
addeth thereto. 
16  Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith 
not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which 
 
is Christ.
