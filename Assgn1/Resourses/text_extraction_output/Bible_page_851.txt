  852    2 Kings 8 
11  And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: 
 
and the man of God wept. 
12  And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, 
 
Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of 
Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men 
 
wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip 
up their women with child. 
13  And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do 
this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath showed me 
 
that thou shalt be king over Syria.  
14  So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to 
 
him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that 
 
thou shouldest surely recover. 
15  And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and 
dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and 
 
Hazael reigned in his stead. 
The Reign of Jehoram of Judah 
16  ¶ And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, 
Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of 
Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 
17  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he 
 
reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
18  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of 
Ahab; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the 
   
sight of the Lord. 
19  Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, 
as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.  
20  ¶ In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and 
made a king over themselves. 
21  So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he 
 
rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him 
about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into 
 
their tents.
