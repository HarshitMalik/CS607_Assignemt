Also consider shadow plays. They light a lamp and beat
a  drum,  and  a  crowd  gathers  to  watch  the  shadows.  As
their  minds  and  eyes  follow  the  shadows,  they  forget
themselves, until the oil is used up and the lamp goes out,
whereupon  all  the  illusions  return  to  nothing.  Intelligent
people who observe this can thereby understand the Way.
When an existence is produced in nonexistence, it exists
yet  is  not  existent;  when  the  existence  returns  to
nonexistence,  it  does  not  exist,  yet  is  not  nonexistent.
Why?  The  existence  of  an  existence  resulting  from  a
conjunction of conditions has no intrinsic identity, so it is
said  that  it  is  not  existent,  in  order  to  refute  the  view  of
permanence. The emptiness of intrinsic identity inherently
has  no  nonexistence,  thus  revealing  real  essence;  so  it  is
said  that  it  is  not  nonexistent,  to  refute  the  view  of
annihilation.
On  a  small  scale  day  and  night,  birth  and  death;  on  a
large  scale  eras  and  ages—all  can  be  understood  by
analogy.  Students  of  the  Way  should  know  that  one
essential nature is real, while myriad conditions are unreal.
All things used in daily life are dust and dirt in unreality—
why contend with mediocrities over the amount and grade
of dust and dirt?
OBJECTS
There  is  nothing  in  the  world  but  one  mind.  Stirring
thoughts  create  all  objects.  If  thoughts  are  not  produced,
