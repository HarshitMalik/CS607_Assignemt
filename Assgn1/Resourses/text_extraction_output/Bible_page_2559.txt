  2560    Hebrews 8 
18  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going 
before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
19  For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better 
hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
 
20  ¶ And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: 
 
21  (for those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath 
 
by him that said unto him, 
The Lord sware and will not repent, 
Thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of Melchizedek:) 
 
22  by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. 
23  ¶ And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered 
to continue by reason of death: 
 
24  but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable 
priesthood. 
25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come 
unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for 
them. 
26  ¶ For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, 
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
 
27  who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, 
first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, 
 
when he offered up himself. 
28  For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the 
 
word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is 
consecrated for evermore.

The Mediator of a New Covenant 
1  Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have 
 
such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the 
Majesty in the heavens;
