all sorts of things, every craving produces an illness. When
even one limb is ailing, it makes the whole body uneasy;
so  if  there  are  myriad  ailments  in  one  mind,  how  could
you prolong your life even if you wanted to?
All  craving  or  hatred  is  forgetfulness  of  life.  When
accumulated  illusions  are  not  cleared  up,  they  interfere
with perception of the Way. This is why we need to give
up  cravings  and  abide  in  nothingness,  so  that  we  have  a
basis  for  gradual  clarification.  If  we  look  back  at  our
former cravings after that, then we will naturally find them
unappealing.
If we view objects with minds absorbed in objects, then
we will never know there is something wrong. If we view
objects  with  minds  detached  from  objects,  only  then  are
we able to see with perfect clarity what is so and what is
not.  A  sober  man,  for  example,  can  see  what  a  drunken
man does wrong, but if he himself is drunk he is not aware
of his own errors.
A  scripture  says,  “I  basically  give  up  the  profane  and
disdain the mundane.” It also says, “Ears and eyes, sound
and  form,  keep  afflicting  you;  the  scents  and  flavors
enjoyed  by  the  nose  and  mouth  are  enemies.”  The  old
master  disdained  the  world,  abandoned  the  profane,  and
alone  saw  that  scent  and  savor  are  enemies—how  can
those  who  indulge  in  craving  for  them  realize  that  “fish
shops stink”?
