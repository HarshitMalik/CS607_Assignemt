  2353    Acts 16 
The Imprisonment at Philippi 
11  ¶ Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to 
Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 
 
12  and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of 
Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain 
 
days. 
13  And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where 
prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the 
 
women which resorted thither. 
14  And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of 
Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord 
 
opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of 
Paul. 
15  And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, 
saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into 
my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. 
16  ¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel 
possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her 
masters much gain by soothsaying: 
 
17  the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the 
servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of 
salvation. 
18  And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and 
said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to 
come out of her. And he came out the same hour. 
19  ¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, 
they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the market place 
unto the rulers, 
20  and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being 
Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
21  and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to 
observe, being Romans. 
22  And the multitude rose up together against them; and the 
 
magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
