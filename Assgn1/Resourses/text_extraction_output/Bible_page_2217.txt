  2218    Luke 18 
Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time 
31  ¶ Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, 
we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the 
prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. 
32  For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, 
and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 
 
33  and they shall scourge him, and put him to death; and the third day 
 
he shall rise again. 
34  And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid 
 
from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. 
A Blind Beggar Healed near Jericho 
35  ¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a 
certain blind man sat by the wayside begging: 
 
36  and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
37  And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
38  And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 
39  And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his 
peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have 
 
mercy on me. 
40  And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and 
 
when he was come near, he asked him, 
41  saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, 
 
that I may receive my sight. 
42  And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved 
 
thee. 
43  And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, 
glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise 
 
unto God.
