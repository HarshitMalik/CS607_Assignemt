  946    1 Chronicles 18 
19  O Lord, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, 
hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great 
things. 
20  O Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides 
thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
21  And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom 
God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of 
greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy 
people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
 
22  For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; 
 
and thou, Lord, becamest their God. 
23  Therefore now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken 
concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for 
ever, and do as thou hast said. 
24  Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, 
saying, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: 
 
and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. 
25  For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him 
a house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before 
 
thee. 
26  And now, Lord, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness 
unto thy servant: 
 
27  now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, 
that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O Lord, and it 
 
shall be blessed for ever.

David Extends His Kingdom 
1  Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and 
subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the 
Philistines. 
2  ¶ And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, 
 
and brought gifts.
