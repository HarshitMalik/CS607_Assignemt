  1332    Psalms 98 
10  Ye that love the Lord, hate evil: 
 
he preserveth the souls of his saints; 
 
he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
11  Light is sown for the righteous, 
and gladness for the upright in heart. 
12  Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; 
 
and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

Praise for Godâ€™s Righteousness 
A Psalm. 
1  O sing unto the Lord a new song; 
 
for he hath done marvelous things: 
 
his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 
2  The Lord hath made known his salvation: 
 
his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the 
heathen. 
3  He hath remembered his mercy and his truth 
toward the house of Israel: 
 
all the ends of the earth have seen 
the salvation of our God. 
4  Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: 
 
make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
5  Sing unto the Lord with the harp; 
 
with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
6  With trumpets and sound of cornet 
make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King. 
7  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
 
the world, and they that dwell therein. 
8  Let the floods clap their hands: 
 
let the hills be joyful together 
9  before the Lord;
