  970    1 Chronicles 29 
6  ¶ Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, 
and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of 
the king’s work, offered willingly, 
7  and gave, for the service of the house of God, of gold five thousand 
talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, 
and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand 
talents of iron. 
8  And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the 
treasure of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the 
Gershonite. 
9  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because 
with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and David 
 
the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
10  ¶ Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation: 
 
and David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for 
ever and ever. 
11  Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and 
the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the 
 
earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted 
 
as head above all. 
12  Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and 
 
in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make 
 
great, and to give strength unto all. 
13  Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious 
name. 
14  ¶ But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to 
offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of 
 
thine own have we given thee. 
15  For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our 
fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none 
 
abiding. 
16  O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee 
a house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine 
own.
