38  beside the sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside 
all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give 
unto the Lord. 
39  ¶ Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have 
gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the 
Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the 
 
eighth day shall be a sabbath. 
40  And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, 
branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows 
of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven 
 
days. 
41  And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year: it 
 
shall be a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in 
 
the seventh month. 
42  Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall 
 
dwell in booths: 
 
43  that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel 
to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I 
 
am the Lord your God. 
44  ¶ And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the 
Lord. 
24 
The Tending of the Lamp 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil 
olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 
3  Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the 
congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the 
morning before the Lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever 
 
in your generations. 
4  He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the 
Lord continually.
