  2435    1 Corinthians 7 
18  Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become 
 
uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be 
 
circumcised. 
19  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the 
keeping of the commandments of God. 
20  Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. 
21  Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be 
   
made free, use it rather. 
22  For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s 
freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s 
 
servant. 
23  Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
 
24  Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with 
God. 
25  ¶ Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: 
 
yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the 
Lord to be faithful. 
26  I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, 
that it is good for a man so to be. 
27  Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed 
 
from a wife? seek not a wife. 
 
28  But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, 
 
she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the 
flesh: but I spare you. 
 
29  But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both 
 
they that have wives be as though they had none; 
 
30  and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, 
 
as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they 
 
possessed not; 
 
31  and they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of 
 
this world passeth away. 
32  ¶ But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried 
careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please 
the Lord:
