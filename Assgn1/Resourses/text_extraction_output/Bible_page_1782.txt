  1783    Ezekiel 16 
30  ¶ How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest 
all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 
 
31  in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, 
and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as a 
 
harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 
 
32  but as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers 
instead of her husband! 
 
33  They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy 
 
lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every 
side for thy whoredom. 
34  And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, 
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that 
 
thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore 
thou art contrary. 
35  ¶ Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord: 
 
36  Thus saith the Lord God; Because thy filthiness was poured out, 
 
and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy 
lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood 
of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; 
 
37  behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast 
taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that 
thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, 
 
and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all 
thy nakedness. 
38  And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood 
are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. 
 
39  And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw 
down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: 
 
they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair 
jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. 
40  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall 
stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. 
41  And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments 
upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to
