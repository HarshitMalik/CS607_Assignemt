15  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the 
 
son of Ahilud, recorder; 
 
16  and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, 
were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
   
17  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the 
Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.

The Defeat of the Ammonites and Syrians 
1  Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children 
of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
2  And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of 
Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent 
messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants 
of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, 
to comfort him. 
3  But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest 
thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent 
comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to 
 
search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
 
4  Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut 
off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent 
them away. 
5  Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served; 
 
and he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And 
 
the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then 
return. 
6  ¶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made 
themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon 
sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and 
horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of Syria-maachah, and out 
of Zobah.
