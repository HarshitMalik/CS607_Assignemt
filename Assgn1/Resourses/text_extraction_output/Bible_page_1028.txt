  1029    2 Chronicles 28 
the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against 
them that came from the war, 
13  and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for 
 
whereas we have offended against the Lord already, ye intend to 
add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, 
 
and there is fierce wrath against Israel. 
14  So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes 
and all the congregation. 
15  And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the 
captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among 
them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and 
to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them 
upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to 
their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. 
 
16  ¶ At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help 
him. 
17  For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried 
away captives. 
18  The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and 
of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, 
and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah 
with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and 
 
they dwelt there. 
19  For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for 
 
he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord. 
20  And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed 
him, but strengthened him not. 
21  For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and out 
of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the 
king of Assyria: but he helped him not. 
 
22  ¶ And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the 
Lord: this is that king Ahaz. 
 
23  For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and 
 
he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore
