  2178    Luke 8 
46  My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath 
 
anointed my feet with ointment. 
47  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; 
 
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth 
 
little. 
48  And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
49  And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, 
Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 
 
50  And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

Some Women Accompany Jesus 
1  And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city 
and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom 
of God: and the twelve were with him, 
 
2  and certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and 
infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven 
devils, 
3  and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and 
many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.  
The Parable of the Sower 
4  ¶ And when much people were gathered together, and were come 
to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 
 
5  A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the 
 
wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air 
 
devoured it. 
6  And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it 
 
withered away, because it lacked moisture. 
7  And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and 
 
choked it.
