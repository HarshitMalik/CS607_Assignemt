  1716    Jeremiah 46 
10  For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, 
that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall 
 
devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for 
 
the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the 
river Euphrates. 
11  Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: 
 
in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. 
 
12  The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the 
land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and 
 
they are fallen both together. 
13  ¶ The word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of 
Egypt.  
14  ¶ Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph 
and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the 
   
sword shall devour round about thee. 
15  Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the 
 
Lord did drive them. 
16  He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, 
 
Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our 
nativity, from the oppressing sword. 
17  They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath 
 
passed the time appointed. 
18  ¶ As I live, saith the King, whose name is The Lord of hosts, Surely 
as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall 
he come. 
19  O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into 
captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an 
 
inhabitant. 
20  Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out 
 
of the north. 
21  Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for 
 
they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not 
 
stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and 
the time of their visitation.
