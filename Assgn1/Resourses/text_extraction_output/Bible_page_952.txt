  953    1 Chronicles 21 
20  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with 
 
him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
21  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and 
went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with 
his face to the ground. 
22  Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this 
threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord: 
 
thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be 
 
stayed from the people. 
23  And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the 
king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for 
 
burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the 
wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. 
 
24  And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the 
 
full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor 
 
offer burnt offerings without cost. 
25  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by 
weight. 
26  And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt 
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the Lord; and he 
 
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. 
27  And the Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword 
 
again into the sheath thereof. 
The Site for the Temple 
28  Â¶ At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in 
the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
29  For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the 
wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season 
in the high place at Gibeon. 
30  But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid 
 
because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
