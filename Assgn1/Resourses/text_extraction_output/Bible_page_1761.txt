  1762    Ezekiel 6 
16  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which 
shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: 
 
and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of 
bread: 
 
17  so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall 
bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and 
   
I will bring the sword upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it.

The Prophecy against the Mountains of Israel 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and 
prophesy against them, 
3  and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God; 
 
Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains and to the hills, to the 
rivers and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
 
you, and I will destroy your high places. 
4  And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: 
 
and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
5  And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before 
their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
 
6  In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the 
high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and 
 
made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your 
images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
7  And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I 
am the Lord. 
8  Â¶ Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape 
the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through 
the countries. 
9  And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations 
whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with 
their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their
