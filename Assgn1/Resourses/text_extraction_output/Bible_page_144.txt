  145    Exodus 9 
22  ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward 
heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, 
and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the 
land of Egypt. 
23  And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord 
 
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and 
 
the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
24  So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, 
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it 
became a nation. 
25  And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in 
the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the 
 
field, and brake every tree of the field. 
26  Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was 
there no hail. 
27  ¶ And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto 
them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my 
 
people are wicked. 
28  Entreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty 
thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no 
 
longer. 
29  And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I 
will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall 
 
cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know 
 
how that the earth is the Lord’s. 
30  But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the 
Lord God. 
31  And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the 
 
ear, and the flax was bolled. 
32  But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not 
 
grown up. 
33  And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad 
his hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and 
 
the rain was not poured upon the earth.
