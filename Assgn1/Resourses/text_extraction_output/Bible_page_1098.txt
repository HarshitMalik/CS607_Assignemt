  1099    Nehemiah 9 
unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy 
 
manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out 
of the hand of their enemies. 
28  But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore 
 
leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the 
dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, 
 
thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver 
 
them according to thy mercies;  
 
29  and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again 
unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy 
 
commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man 
do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and 
 
hardened their neck, and would not hear. 
30  Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against 
them by thy Spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: 
   
therefore gavest thou them into the hands of the people of the 
lands. 
31  Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly 
consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and 
 
merciful God. 
32  ¶ Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible 
God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem 
little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our 
princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our 
fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria 
unto this day. 
33  Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast 
 
done right, but we have done wickedly: 
 
34  neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, 
kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy 
testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. 
35  For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great 
goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which 
thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked 
works.
