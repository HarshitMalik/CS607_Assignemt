  2410    Romans 10 
2  For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not 
according to knowledge. 
3  For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to 
establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves 
unto the righteousness of God. 
4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that 
believeth. 
5  ¶ For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That 
the man which doeth those things shall live by them.  
6  But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say 
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring 
 
Christ down from above:) 
 
7  or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ 
 
again from the dead.) 
8  But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in 
 
thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
   
9  that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt 
believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou 
shalt be saved. 
10  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the 
 
mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
11  For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be 
ashamed.  
12  For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the 
 
same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 
13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  
14  ¶ How then shall they call on him in whom they have not 
believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not 
 
heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 
   
15  and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, 
 
How beautiful are the feet of them 
that preach the gospel of peace, 
and bring glad tidings of good things!  
 
16  But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who 
hath believed our report?
