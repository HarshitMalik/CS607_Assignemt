  1512    Isaiah 11 
30  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto 
 
Laish, O poor Anathoth. 
31  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather 
 
themselves to flee. 
32  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand 
 
against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
33  ¶ Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough with 
terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the 
 
haughty shall be humbled. 
34  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and 
Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. 
11 
The Righteous Reign of the Branch of Jesse 
1  And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a 
Branch shall grow out of his roots:  
 
2  and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of 
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the 
spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; 
 
3  and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the 
Lord. 
¶ And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove 
after the hearing of his ears: 
 
4  but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with 
equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with 
 
the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay 
the wicked.  
5  And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness 
the girdle of his reins.  
6  ¶ The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie 
down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling 
 
together; and a little child shall lead them.
