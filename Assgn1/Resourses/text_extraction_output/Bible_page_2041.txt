  2042    Matthew 12 
27  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children 
cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. 
 
28  But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of 
God is come unto you.

shalt be condemned. 
An Evil Generation Seeks a Sign 
38  ¶ Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, 
Master, we would see a sign from thee.  
39  But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous 
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to 
 
it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:
