  2267    John 8 
23  And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye 
   
are of this world; I am not of this world. 
 
24  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye 
 
believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. 
25  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto 
 
them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. 
26  I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is 
 
true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of 
 
him. 
27  They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 
28  Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, 
then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; 
 
but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
29  And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; 
   
for I do always those things that please him. 
30  As he spake these words, many believed on him. 
The Truth Shall Make You Free 
31  ¶ Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye 
continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 
 
32  and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 
33  They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in 
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 
   
34  ¶ Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever 
committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
35  And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son 
 
abideth ever. 
36  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 
37  I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because 
 
my word hath no place in you. 
38  I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that 
 
which ye have seen with your father.
