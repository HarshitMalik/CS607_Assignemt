  1340    Psalms 104 
as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 
18  The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; 
 
and the rocks for the conies. 
19  He appointed the moon for seasons: 
 
the sun knoweth his going down. 
20  Thou makest darkness, and it is night: 
 
wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. 
21  The young lions roar after their prey, 
and seek their meat from God. 
22  The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, 
and lay them down in their dens. 
23  Man goeth forth unto his work 
and to his labor until the evening. 
24  O Lord, how manifold are thy works! 
 
In wisdom hast thou made them all: 
 
the earth is full of thy riches. 
25  So is this great and wide sea, 
wherein are things creeping innumerable, 
both small and great beasts. 
26  There go the ships: 
 
there is that leviathan,  
whom thou hast made to play therein. 
27  These wait all upon thee; 
 
that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 
28  That thou givest them they gather: 
 
thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. 
29  Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: 
 
thou takest away their breath, they die, 
and return to their dust. 
30  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: 
 
and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
31  The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: 
 
the Lord shall rejoice in his works. 
32  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: 
 
he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
