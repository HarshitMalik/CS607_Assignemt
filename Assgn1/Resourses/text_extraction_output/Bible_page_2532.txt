  2533    1 Timothy 5 
12  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the 
 
believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in 
purity. 
13  Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
14  Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by 
prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
15  Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy 
   
profiting may appear to all. 
16  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: 
   
for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear 
thee.

Responsibilities toward Others 
1  Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger 
 
men as brethren; 
 
2  the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. 
 
3  ¶ Honor widows that are widows indeed. 
4  But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to 
show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good 
 
and acceptable before God. 
5  Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and 
continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. 
6  But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. 
7  And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. 
8  But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his 
own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
9  ¶ Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years 
old, having been the wife of one man, 
10  well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if 
 
she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she 
have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every 
good work.
