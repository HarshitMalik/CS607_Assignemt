  2630    Revelation 10 
14  saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four 
angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. 
15  And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, 
and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of 
men. 
16  And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred 
thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. 
 
17  And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, 
having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the 
 
heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their 
 
mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. 
18  By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by 
the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 
19  For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails 
 
were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do 
hurt. 
20  Â¶ And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues 
yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not 
worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, 
and of wood; which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:  
   
21  neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor 
of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

The Angel and the Little Book 
1  And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed 
with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as 
 
it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: 
 
2  and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot 
 
upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, 
3  and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he 
 
had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
