  2392    Romans 2 
24  ¶ Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the 
lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between 
themselves: 
 
25  who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and 
served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. 
Amen. 
26  ¶ For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even 
 
their women did change the natural use into that which is against 
nature: 
 
27  and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, 
burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working 
 
that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that 
recompense of their error which was meet. 
28  ¶ And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, 
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which 
are not convenient; 
 
29  being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, 
covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, 
 
malignity; whisperers, 
 
30  backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of 
evil things, disobedient to parents, 
31  without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural 
affection, implacable, unmerciful: 
 
32  who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such 
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure 
in them that do them.

The Righteous Judgment of God 
1  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that 
judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest 
 
thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
