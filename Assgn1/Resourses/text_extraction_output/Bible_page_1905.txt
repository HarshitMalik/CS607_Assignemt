  1906    Hosea 2 
people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living 
God.  
11  Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be 
gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall 
come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. 
 
2 
The Lord’s Love for His Unfaithful People 
1  Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi [my people]; and to your sisters, 
 
Ruhamah [having obtained mercy]. 
2  ¶ Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am 
 
I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her 
 
sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
 
3  lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, 
and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay 
her with thirst. 
4  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the 
 
children of whoredoms. 
5  For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them 
 
hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that 
 
give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and 
my drink. 
6  Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy ways with thorns, and make 
a wall, that she shall not find her paths. 
7  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake 
them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall 
   
she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it 
 
better with me than now. 
8  ¶ For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and 
multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. 
9  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, 
and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and 
my flax given to cover her nakedness.
