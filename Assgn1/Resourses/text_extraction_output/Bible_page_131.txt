  132    Exodus 4 
12  Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee 
what thou shalt say. 
13  And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom

15  And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I

instead of God. 
17  And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt 
do signs.

22  And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
