Solomonâ€™s Agreement with King Huram 
1  And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the 
Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 
2  And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear 
burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and

me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide. 
8  Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon:

and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 
9  even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am 
 
about to build shall be wonderful great. 
10  And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, 
twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand
