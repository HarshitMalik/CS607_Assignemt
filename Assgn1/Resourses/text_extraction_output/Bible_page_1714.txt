  1715    Jeremiah 46 
3  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to 
 
my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. 
 
4  Thus shalt thou say unto him, The Lord saith thus; Behold, that 
 
which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted 
I will pluck up, even this whole land. 
5  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, 
   
behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life 
 
will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

Prophecies concerning Egypt 
1  The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against 
the Gentiles; 
 
2  against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, 
which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of 
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 
3  ¶ Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 
4  Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with 
 
your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. 
 
5  Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and 
 
their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look 
not back: for fear was round about, saith the Lord. 
 
6  Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall 
 
stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. 
7  ¶ Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as 
the rivers? 
 
8  Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the 
rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will 
   
destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. 
9  Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men 
   
come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; 
   
and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
