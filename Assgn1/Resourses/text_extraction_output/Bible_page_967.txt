  968    1 Chronicles 28 
9  ¶ And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, 
and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the 
 
Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations 
of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if 
   
thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 
10  Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build a house for 
 
the sanctuary: be strong, and do it. 
 
11  ¶ Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, 
and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the 
upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of 
the place of the mercy seat, 
12  and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the 
house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, of the 
treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated 
things: 
 
13  also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the 
work of the service of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels 
of service in the house of the Lord. 
14  He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all 
manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, 
 
for all instruments of every kind of service: 
 
15  even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of 
gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: 
 
and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, 
and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every 
candlestick. 
16  And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for every 
table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 
   
17  also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and 
 
for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and 
 
likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver: 
 
18  and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the 
 
pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, 
and covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
