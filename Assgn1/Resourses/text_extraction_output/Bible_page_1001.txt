  1002    2 Chronicles 15 
8  ¶ And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the 
prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of 
all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he 
had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the 
Lord, that was before the porch of the Lord. 
9  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with 
them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they 
 
fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the 
Lord his God was with him. 
10  So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third 
month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
11  And they offered unto the Lord the same time, of the spoil which 
they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. 
12  And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their 
fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 
 
13  that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be 
put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 
14  And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with 
shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 
15  And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their 
 
heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of 
 
them: and the Lord gave them rest round about. 
 
16  ¶ And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he 
removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a 
grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at 
 
the brook Kidron. 
17  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless 
 
the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
18  And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had 
dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and 
vessels. 
19  And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the 
reign of Asa.
