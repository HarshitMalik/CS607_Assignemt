The Inheritance of the Levites 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan 
near Jericho, saying, 
2  Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites, of 
the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and ye shall 
 
give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. 
3  And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them 
 
shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. 
4  And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, 
shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits 
round about. 
5  And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two 
thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on 
the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two 
thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to 
   
them the suburbs of the cities. 
6  And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall 
be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, 
that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two 
 
cities. 
7  So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and 
eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs. 
 
8  And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the 
children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but 
   
from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his 
 
cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he 
inheriteth.
