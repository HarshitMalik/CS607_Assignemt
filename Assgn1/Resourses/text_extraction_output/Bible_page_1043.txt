  1044    2 Chronicles 34 
18  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his 
God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of 
the Lord God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the 
kings of Israel. 
19  His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sins, 
and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set 
up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they 
 
are written among the sayings of the seers. 
20  So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own 
house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 
 
The Reign of Amon 
21  ¶ Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and 
reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
22  But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did 
Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved 
 
images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 
 
23  and humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father 
had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more. 
 
24  And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own 
house. 
25  But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against 
king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in 
 
his stead.

The Reign of Josiah 
1  Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 
in Jerusalem one and thirty years. 
2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and 
walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the 
right hand, nor to the left.
