  1700    Jeremiah 38 
10  Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 
Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the 
prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. 
11  So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house 
of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and 
old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to 
Jeremiah. 
12  And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these 
old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the 
cords. And Jeremiah did so. 
13  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the 
dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. 
 
Zedekiah Seeks Counsel from Jeremiah 
14  ¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet 
unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord: and 
 
the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing 
 
from me. 
15  Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt 
thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt 
 
thou not hearken unto me? 
 
16  So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the 
Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, 
neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy 
life. 
17  ¶ Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God 
of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the 
 
king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall 
not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: 
   
18  but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then 
shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they 
shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
