  415    Deuteronomy 3 
before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the 
war. 
19  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know 
that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have 
given you; 
 
20  until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto 
you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God 
hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man 
 
unto his possession, which I have given you.  
21  And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have 
seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: 
 
so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 
22  Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for 
 
you. 
Moses Not Permitted to Enter Canaan 
23  Â¶ And I besought the Lord at that time, saying, 
24  O Lord God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, 
and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, 
 
that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 
 
25  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond 
Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
26  But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not 
hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no 
   
more unto me of this matter. 
27  Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, 
and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with 
thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.  
 
28  But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he 
 
shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit 
the land which thou shalt see. 
29  So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
