your  mind  is  free,  only  then  can  you  see  the  subtle.  The
classic  says,  “Always  be  free  from  desire  to  see  the
subtle.”
Nevertheless,  the  body  with  which  you  cultivate  the
Way  needs  to  be  clothed  and  fed.  There  are  some  things
you cannot dispense with; accept this with an empty heart,
take  responsibility  for  it  with  clear  eyes.  Do  not  say  this
will  impede  your  mind  and  create  vexation  and
excitement;  those  who  get  vexed  and  excited  over  things
already  have  active  afflictions  of  mind—how  can  that  be
called pacifying the mind?
Human  relations,  clothing,  and  food  are  our  boats;  if
you want to cross the sea, you use a boat. Once you have
crossed the sea, you logically do not stay in the boat. But
why would you want to abandon the boat before you have
crossed over? The vanities of food and clothing are really
not  worth  working  for,  but  we  seek  food  and  clothing  in
order to get beyond vanity.
Even though you work for your needs, do not give rise
to thoughts of gain and loss; then whether or not there is
something  to  do  your  mind  will  always  be  at  peace.  You
seek like others but not greedily as others do; you gain like
others but do not accumulate as others do. When you are
not  greedy,  you  are  not  anxious;  when  you  do  not
accumulate stores, you do not lose anything. Your outward
appearance is like that of others, but your mind is always
different  from  worldlings.  This  is  the  essence  of  true
practice; you should make an effort to apply it.
