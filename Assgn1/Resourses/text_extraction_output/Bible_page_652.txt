  653    1 Samuel 15 
10  ¶ Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, 
11  It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned 
 
back from following me, and hath not performed my 
commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the 
 
Lord all night. 
12  And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was 
told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him 
up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to 
Gilgal. 
13  And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou 
 
of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord. 
 
14  And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in 
mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 
 
15  And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for 
 
the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice 
unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. 
 
16  Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the 
Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. 
17  ¶ And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast 
thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord 
anointed thee king over Israel? 
 
18  And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly 
destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until 
they be consumed. 
19  Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but 
didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord? 
 
20  And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the 
Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have 
brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the 
Amalekites. 
21  But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the 
things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto 
the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
