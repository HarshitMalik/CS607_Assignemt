  1452    Proverbs 27 
14  He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, 
rising early in the morning, 
it shall be counted a curse to him. 
15  A continual dropping in a very rainy day 
and a contentious woman are alike. 
16  Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, 
and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. 
17  Iron sharpeneth iron; 
 
so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 
18  Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: 
 
so he that waiteth on his master shall be honored. 
19  As in water face answereth to face, 
so the heart of man to man. 
20  Hell and destruction are never full; 
 
so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 
21  As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; 
 
so is a man to his praise. 
22  Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a 
pestle, 
yet will not his foolishness depart from him. 
23  Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, 
and look well to thy herds: 
 
24  for riches are not for ever: 
 
and doth the crown endure to every generation? 
 
25  The hay appeareth, 
and the tender grass showeth itself, 
and herbs of the mountains are gathered. 
26  The lambs are for thy clothing, 
and the goats are the price of the field. 
27  And thou shalt have goatsâ€™ milk enough for thy food, 
for the food of thy household, 
and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
