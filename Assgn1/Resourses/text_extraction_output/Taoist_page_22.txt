stopping promiscuous lust, you can replenish your kidneys
and generative organs.
If  asked  for  more,  I  would  say  don’t  worry  about  not
replenishing;  beware  of  replenishing  and  then  wasting
again.  I  have  therefore  said,  after  a  hundred  days  of
replenishment you do not see excess; but one day of waste

Look  at  the  plants  and  trees;  their  foliage  flourishes,
then  drops  in  late  autumn,  returning  to  the  roots,  as  a

regenerates  come  springtime.  From  this  principle  we  can
see  that  endless  regeneration  is  the  Way  of  nature,  while
returning  to  their  roots  is  the  inherent  pattern  of  beings.
Those  who  know  the  inherent  pattern  and  do  not  violate
the Way are real people. That is why “real people breathe
from  their  heels”—the  heels  are  like  the  root.  During  the
three months of winter, which is the season of return to the
root, you should quietly nurture this.
SICKNESS
How does sickness arise? Everyone creates psychological
afflictions  based  on  wandering  thoughts.  Once
psychological afflictions have arisen, they injure the heart
within.  Once  the  heart  is  injured,  it  cannot  nurture  the

debilitated, the lung energy will be deficient, thus causing
a cough. Once there is a cough, water energy dries up, so
