  123    Genesis 50 
6  And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he 
made thee swear. 
7  And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all 
 
the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders 
of the land of Egypt, 
8  and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s 
house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they 
 
left in the land of Goshen. 
9  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it 
 
was a very great company. 
10  And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond 
Jordan; and there they mourned with a great and very sore 
 
lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
 
11  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the 
mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous 
mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called 
 
Abel-mizraim [the mourning of the Egyptians], which is beyond 
Jordan. 
12  And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
 
13  for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in 
the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with 
the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, 
before Mamre.  
14  And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that 
went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
The Death of Joseph 
15  ¶ And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they 
said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us 
all the evil which we did unto him. 
16  And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did 
command before he died, saying, 
17  So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of 
thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now,
