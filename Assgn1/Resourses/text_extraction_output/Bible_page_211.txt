  212    Exodus 35 
all jewels of gold: and every man that offered, offered an offering of 
 
gold unto the Lord. 
23  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and 
scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, and red skins of rams, and 
badgers’ skins, brought them. 
24  Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the 
Lord’s offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim 
 
wood for any work of the service, brought it. 
25  And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their 
hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of 
purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. 
26  And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun 
goats’ hair. 
27  And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the 
ephod, and for the breastplate; 
 
28  and spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for 
the sweet incense. 
29  The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord, 
every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring 
for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be 
made by the hand of Moses. 
The Call of Bezaleel and Aholiab 
30  ¶ And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath 
called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe 
of Judah; 
 
31  and he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in 
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of 
workmanship; 
 
32  and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in 
brass, 
33  and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to 
make any manner of cunning work.
