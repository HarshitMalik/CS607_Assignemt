  76    Genesis 31 
41  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen 
 
years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle; and thou 
 
hast changed my wages ten times. 
42  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of 
Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now 
empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, 
and rebuked thee yesternight. 
43  ¶ And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my 
daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are 
my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day 
 
unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have 
borne? 
 
44  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and 
 
let it be for a witness between me and thee. 
45  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
46  And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took 
 
stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
 
47  And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha [the heap of witness]: but 
 
Jacob called it Galeed [the heap of witness]. 
48  And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this 
day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed, 
49  and Mizpah [a beacon or watchtower]; for he said, The Lord watch 
 
between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 
50  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives 
beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt 
 
me and thee. 
51  ¶ And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, 
which I have cast betwixt me and thee; 
 
52  this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass 
over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap 
and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
53  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their 
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father 
Isaac.
