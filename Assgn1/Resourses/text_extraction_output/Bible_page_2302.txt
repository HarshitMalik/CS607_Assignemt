  2303    John 20 
22  And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto 
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 
 
23  whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and 
 
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.  
The Unbelief of Thomas 
24  ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with 
them when Jesus came. 
25  The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. 
But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of 
the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust 
my hand into his side, I will not believe. 
26  ¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas 
with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the 
 
midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
27  Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my 
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be 
   
not faithless, but believing. 
28  And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
29  Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast 
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 
 
The Purpose of the Book 
30  ¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his 
disciples, which are not written in this book: 
 
31  but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his 
 
name.
