  2052    Matthew 15 
2  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they 
 
wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
3  But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the 
commandment of God by your tradition? 
 
4  For God commanded, saying, 
Honor thy father and mother:  
 
and, 
He that curseth father or mother, 
let him die the death.  
5  But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a 
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
 
6  and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye 
made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. 
7  Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 
8  This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, 
and honoreth me with their lips; 
 
but their heart is far from me. 
9  But in vain they do worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  
10  Â¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and 
understand: 
 
11  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that 
 
which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
12  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
 
13  But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father 
hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
14  Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind 
 
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  
15  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this 
parable. 
16  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
 
17  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the 
mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
