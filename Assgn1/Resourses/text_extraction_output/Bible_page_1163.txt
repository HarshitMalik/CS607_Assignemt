  1164    Job 21 
17  How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! 
 
And how oft cometh their destruction upon them! 
 
God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
18  They are as stubble before the wind, 
and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
19  God layeth up his iniquity for his children: 
 
he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. 
20  His eyes shall see his destruction, 
and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
21  For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, 
when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
 
22  Shall any teach God knowledge? 
 
seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
23  One dieth in his full strength, 
being wholly at ease and quiet. 
24  His breasts are full of milk, 
and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
25  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, 
and never eateth with pleasure. 
26  They shall lie down alike in the dust, 
and the worms shall cover them. 
27  Behold, I know your thoughts, 
and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 
28  For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? 
 
And where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 
 
29  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? 
 
And do ye not know their tokens, 
30  that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? 
 
They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
31  Who shall declare his way to his face? 
 
And who shall repay him what he hath done? 
 
32  Yet shall he be brought to the grave, 
and shall remain in the tomb. 
33  The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, 
and every man shall draw after him,
