  684    1 Samuel 27 
17  ¶ And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son 
David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. 
 
18  And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? 
 
for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? 
   
19  Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of 
his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him 
accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they 
 
before the Lord; for they have driven me out this day from abiding 
 
in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods. 
20  Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of 
the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when 
 
one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. 
21  ¶ Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no 
   
more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this 
day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. 
 
22  And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one 
 
of the young men come over and fetch it. 
23  The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his 
faithfulness: for the Lord delivered thee into my hand today, but I 
 
would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord’s anointed. 
24  And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so 
let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him 
deliver me out of all tribulation. 
25  Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt 
 
both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on 
his way, and Saul returned to his place.

David Lives among the Philistines 
1  And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand 
of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily 
 
escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me,
