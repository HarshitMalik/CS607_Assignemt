  279    Leviticus 21 
6  They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of 
their God: for the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the 
 
bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 
 
7  They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall 
 
they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto 
 
his God. 
8  Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy 
 
God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the Lord, which sanctify 
   
you, am holy. 
9  And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the 
whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. 
 
10  ¶ And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose 
head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put 
on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
 
11  neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his 
father, or for his mother; 
 
12  neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary 
of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon 
 
him: I am the Lord. 
 
13  And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
14  A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or a harlot, these shall 
he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 
 
15  Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the Lord 
 
do sanctify him. 
16  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
17  Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their 
generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer 
the bread of his God. 
18  For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not 
approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any 
 
thing superfluous, 
19  or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, 
20  or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be 
scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
