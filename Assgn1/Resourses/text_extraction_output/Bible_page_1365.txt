  1366    Psalms 119 
62  At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee 
because of thy righteous judgments. 
63  I am a companion of all them that fear thee, 
and of them that keep thy precepts. 
64  The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: 
 
teach me thy statutes. 
teth 
65  Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, 
according unto thy word. 
66  Teach me good judgment and knowledge: 
 
for I have believed thy commandments. 
67  Before I was afflicted I went astray: 
 
but now have I kept thy word. 
68  Thou art good, and doest good: 
 
teach me thy statutes. 
69  The proud have forged a lie against me: 
 
but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. 
70  Their heart is as fat as grease: 
 
but I delight in thy law. 
71  It is good for me that I have been afflicted; 
 
that I might learn thy statutes. 
72  The law of thy mouth is better unto me 
than thousands of gold and silver. 
jod 
73  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: 
 
give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 
74  They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; 
 
because I have hoped in thy word. 
75  I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, 
and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. 
76  Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, 
according to thy word unto thy servant. 
77  Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: 
 
for thy law is my delight. 
78  Let the proud be ashamed;
