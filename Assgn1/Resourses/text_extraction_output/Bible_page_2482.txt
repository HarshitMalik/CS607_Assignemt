2  but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the 
father. 
3  Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the 
elements of the world: 
 
4  but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, 
made of a woman, made under the law, 
5  to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the 
adoption of sons. 
6  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son 
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
7  Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then 
 
an heir of God through Christ.  
Warning against Returning to Bondage 
8  ¶ Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them 
which by nature are no gods. 
9  But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of 
God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, 
whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 
 
10  Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
11  I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain. 
12  ¶ Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not 
   
injured me at all. 
13  Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel 
unto you at the first. 
14  And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor 
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
 
15  Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, 
 
that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own 
eyes, and have given them to me. 
16  Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? 
 
17  They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude 
 
you, that ye might affect them.
