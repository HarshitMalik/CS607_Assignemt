O my mind, become Gurmukh, and remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord. It shall 
stand by you forever, and go along with you.  || Pause  ||   The True One is the social 
status  and  the  honor  of  the  Gurmukh.  Within  the  Gurmukh  is  God,  his  friend  and 
helper.  || 2 ||   He alone becomes Gurmukh, whom the Lord so blesses. He Himself 
blesses the Gurmukh with greatness.  || 3 ||   The Gurmukh lives the True Word of the 
Shabad, and practices good deeds. The Gurmukh, O Nanak, emancipates his family and 
relations.  || 4 || 6 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  My tongue is intuitively attracted to 
the taste of the Lord. My mind is satisfied, meditating on the Name of the Lord.  || 1 ||   
Lasting peace is obtained, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. I am forever a 
sacrifice to my True Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My eyes are content, lovingly focused on 
the One Lord. My mind is content, having forsaken the love of duality.  || 2 ||   The 
frame of my body is at peace, through the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. The 
fragrance of the Naam permeates my heart.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, one who has such great 
destiny  written  upon  his  forehead,  through  the  Word  of  the  Guru‟s  Bani,  easily  and 
intuitively becomes free of desire.  || 4 || 7 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  From the 
Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained. Through the True Word of the Shabad, one merges 
in the True Lord.  || 1 ||   O my mind, you shall obtain the treasure of the Naam, by 
submitting to the Will of your Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Through the Word of the Guru‟s 
Shabad, filth is washed away from within. The immaculate Naam comes to abide within 
the mind.  || 2 ||   Deluded by doubt, the world wanders around. It dies, and is born 
again, ruined by the Messenger of Death.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, very fortunate are those 
who  meditate  on  the  Name  of  the  Lord.  By  Guru‟s  Grace,  they  enshrine  the  Name 
within their minds.  || 4 || 8 ||   WADAHANS,  THIRD MEHL:  Egotism is opposed to the 
Name of the Lord; the two do not dwell in the same place. In egotism, selfless service 
cannot be performed, and so the mind goes unfulfilled.  || 1 ||   O my mind, think of 
the Lord, and practice the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. If you submit to the Hukam of 
the Lord‟s Command, you shall meet with the Lord, and then egotism will depart from 
within.  ||  Pause  ||   Egotism is within all bodies; through egotism, we come to be 
born. Egotism is utter darkness; in egotism, no one can understand anything.  || 2 ||   
In  egotism,  devotional  worship  cannot  be  performed,  and  the  Hukam  of  the  Lord‟s 
Command cannot be  understood. In  egotism, the soul is in bondage, and the Naam 
does not come to abide in the mind.  || 3 ||   O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, 
egotism is eliminated, and then, the True One comes to dwell in the mind. Practicing 
Truth, abiding in Truth, and serving Truth, one is absorbed in the True One. || 4 || 9 ||

WADAHANS,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
There is one bed, One God Lord and Master. The Gurmukh enjoys the Lord, the ocean 
of peace.  || 1 ||   My mind longs to meet my Beloved Lord God.
