  1149    Job 13 
14  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: 
 
he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 
15  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: 
 
also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
16  With him is strength and wisdom: 
 
the deceived and the deceiver are his. 
17  He leadeth counselors away spoiled, 
and maketh the judges fools. 
18  He looseth the bond of kings, 
and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
19  He leadeth princes away spoiled, 
and overthroweth the mighty. 
20  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, 
and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
21  He poureth contempt upon princes, 
and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
22  He discovereth deep things out of darkness, 
and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
23  He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: 
 
he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. 
24  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, 
and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 
25  They grope in the dark without light, 
and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.

Job Defends His Integrity 
1  Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, 
mine ear hath heard and understood it. 
2  What ye know, the same do I know also: 
 
I am not inferior unto you. 
3  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, 
and I desire to reason with God.
