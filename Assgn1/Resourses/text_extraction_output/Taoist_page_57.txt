Goodness  is  the  positive  energy  generated  by  the  first
movement  of  the  absolute.  Humans  have  this  for  their
essential  nature,  so  human  nature  is  universally  good.
Those  who  would  cultivate  this  must  nurture  positive
energy.
In terms of the climate, positive energy arises after pure
negative energy in the tenth lunar month. This is the true
breath within the compass.
By way of admonition, Buddha said that good and bad
causes and effects of heaven and hell are unavoidable and
will inevitably be experienced some day in future life.
Confucius  simply  said,  “Arrive  above  or  arrive  below,
calm  and  at  ease  or  always  anxious.”  “Arriving  above”
means  advancing  day  by  day  to  lofty  illumination—what
is that if not heaven?
“Arriving below” means sinking into base corruption—
what is that if not hell?
Being “calm and at ease” means being happy wherever
you are—whose blessings can compare to this?
Being  “always  anxious”  means  there  are  pitfalls
wherever you go—no calamity is greater.
Generally  speaking,  the  time  when  you  do  good  or  do
evil  is  when  you  experience  blessing  or  calamity—it  is
like  a  shadow  or  an  echo,  not  waiting  for  another  day  or
future life.
Someone asked a Chan Buddhist, “Do heaven and hell
exist or not?”
