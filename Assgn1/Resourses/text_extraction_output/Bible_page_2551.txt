  2552    Hebrews 2 
The Captain of Salvation Made Perfect through Suffering 
5  ¶ For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to 
come, whereof we speak. 
6  But one in a certain place testified, saying, 
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? 
 
or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
 
7  Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; 
 
thou crownedst him with glory and honor, 
and didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
 
8  thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.  
For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is 
not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under 
him. 
9  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for 
the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by 
 
the grace of God should taste death for every man. 
10  ¶ For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all 
things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of 
their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
11  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of 
one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
 
12  saying, 
I will declare thy name unto my brethren, 
in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  
13  And again, 
I will put my trust in him.  
And again, 
Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  
14  ¶ Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, 
he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death 
 
he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the 
devil; 
 
15  and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their lifetime 
subject to bondage.
