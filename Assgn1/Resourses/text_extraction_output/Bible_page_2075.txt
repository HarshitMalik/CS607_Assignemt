  2076    Matthew 23 
matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to 
 
have done, and not to leave the other undone. 
24  Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. 
25  ¶ Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make 
 
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are 
full of extortion and excess. 
26  Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and 
platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. 
27  ¶ Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like 
 
unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, 
but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. 
28  Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within 
ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 
29  ¶ Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build 
 
the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the 
righteous, 
30  and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not 
have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 
31  Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children 
of them which killed the prophets. 
32  Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 
33  Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the 
damnation of hell? 
 
34  Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and 
scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them 
   
shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to 
city: 
 
35  that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the 
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of 
Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom ye slew between the temple and 
the altar. 
36  Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this 
generation.
