Your servant offers this prayer, O Beloved: I live by meditating on Your Feet, God.  || 1 
||  Pause  ||   O my Merciful Lord God, O Great Giver: they alone know, whom You 
bless with realization.  || 2 ||   Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You. Here and 
hereafter, I seek Your Protection.  || 3 ||   I am without virtue; I know none of Your 
Glorious Virtues. O Nanak, seeing the Holy Saint, my mind is imbued with You.  || 4 || 3 
||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  God is perfect — He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher 
of hearts. He blesses us with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Holy.  || 1 ||   Please 
bless me with Your Grace, O God, Merciful to the meek. I seek Your Shelter, O Perfect 
Lord of the World.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is totally pervading and permeating the water, 
the land and the sky. He dwells near at hand; God is not far away.  || 2 ||   One whom 
He blesses with His Glance of Grace, meditates on Him. Twenty-four hours a day, he 
sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   God cherishes all beings and creatures. 
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Door.  || 4 || 4 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  
You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. God, the Perfect 
Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading in all.  || 1 ||   The Name of my Beloved 
God is my only support. I live by hearing, continually hearing Your Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   I seek Your Sanctuary, O my Perfect True Guru. My mind is purified by the dust of 
the Saints.  || 2 ||   I have enshrined His Lotus Feet within my heart. I am a sacrifice to 
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.  || 3 ||   Grant Your Grace, that I may sing Your 
Glorious Praises. O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I find peace.  || 4 
|| 5 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, 
drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. The soul does not die; it ever wastes away.  
||  1  ||      By  great  good  fortune, one  meets the Perfect Guru. By  Guru‟s Grace, one 
meditates on God.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The Lord is the jewel, the pearl, the gem, the 
diamond.  Meditating,  meditating  in  remembrance  on  God,  I  am  enraptured.    ||  2 ||   
Wherever I look, I see the Sanctuary of the Holy. Singing the Glorious Praises of the 
Lord, my mind becomes immaculate and pure.  || 3 ||   Deep within the nucleus of each 
and  every  heart,  my  Lord  and  Master  dwells.  O  Nanak,  one  obtains  the  Naam,  the 
Name of the Lord, when God grants His Grace.  || 4 || 6 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  
Do  not  forget  me,  O  God,  Merciful  to  the  meek.  I  seek  Your  Sanctuary,  O  Perfect, 
Compassionate Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Wherever You come to mind, that place is 
blessed. The moment I forget You, I am stricken with regret.  || 1 ||   All beings are 
Yours; You are their constant companion. Please, give me Your hand, and lift me up, 
out of this world-ocean.  || 2 ||   Coming and going are by Your making. One whom 
You save is not afflicted with suffering.  || 3 ||   You are the One Lord and Master; 
there is no other at all. Nanak offers this prayer with his palms pressed together.  || 4 
|| 7 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  When You allow Yourself to be known, then we 
know You. We chant Your Name, which You have given to us.  || 1 ||
