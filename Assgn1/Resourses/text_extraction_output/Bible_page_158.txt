  159    Exodus 15 
31  And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the 
Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the 
 
Lord, and his servant Moses.

The Song of Moses 
1  Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the 
Lord, and spake, saying, 
I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: 
 
the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
2  The Lord is my strength and song, 
and he is become my salvation:  
 
he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; 
 
my father’s God, and I will exalt him. 
3  The Lord is a man of war: 
 
the Lord is his name. 
4  Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: 
 
his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
5  The depths have covered them: 
 
they sank into the bottom as a stone. 
6  Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: 
 
thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 
7  And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown 
them that rose up against thee: 
 
thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. 
8  And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered 
together, 
the floods stood upright as a heap, 
and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
9  The enemy said, 
I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; 
 
my lust shall be satisfied upon them; 
 
I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
