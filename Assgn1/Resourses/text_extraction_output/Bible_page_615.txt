  616    Ruth 3 
22  And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my 
daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee 
not in any other field. 
23  So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of 
barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-
 
law. 
3 
Ruth and Boaz at the Threshingfloor 
1  Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I 
not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 
 
2  And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou 
wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley tonight in the threshingfloor. 
 
3  Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon 
thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known 
 
unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. 
4  And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place 
where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and 
lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. 
 
5  And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. 
6  Â¶ And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that 
her mother-in-law bade her. 
7  And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he 
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came 
 
softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. 
8  And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and 
turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
 
9  And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine 
 
handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for 
   
thou art a near kinsman. 
10  And he said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou 
 
hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, 
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
