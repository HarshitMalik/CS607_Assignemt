  745    2 Samuel 21 
22  Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom: and they 
 
cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. 
And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man 
to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. 
David’s Officers 
23  ¶ Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of 
 
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 
 
24  and Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of 
 
Ahilud was recorder:

26  and Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in 
 
Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you. 
5  And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
