  434    Deuteronomy 10 
11  And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the 
people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware 
unto their fathers to give unto them. 
What God Requires 
12  ¶ And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, 
but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love 
him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all 
thy soul, 
13  to keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I 
command thee this day for thy good? 
 
14  Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord’s thy 
God, the earth also, with all that therein is. 
15  Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he 
chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this 
day. 
16  Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more 
stiffnecked. 
17  For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great 
God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor 
taketh reward: 
 
18  he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and 
loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
19  Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of 
 
Egypt. 
20  Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to 
 
him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 
21  He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these 
great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. 
22  Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; 
 
and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven 
for multitude.
