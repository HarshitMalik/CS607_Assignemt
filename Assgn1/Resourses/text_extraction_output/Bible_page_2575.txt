  2576    James 1 
Trial and Temptation 
12  ¶ Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, 
 
he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to 
them that love him. 
13  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God 
 
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 
 
14  but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, 
and enticed. 
15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, 
 
when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 
16  ¶ Do not err, my beloved brethren. 
17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh 
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, 
neither shadow of turning. 
18  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should 
be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 
Hearing and Doing the Word 
19  ¶ Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, 
slow to speak, slow to wrath: 
 
20  for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. 
21  Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, 
and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to 
save your souls. 
22  ¶ But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your 
own selves. 
23  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a 
man beholding his natural face in a glass: 
 
24  for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway 
forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
25  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth 
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this 
man shall be blessed in his deed.
