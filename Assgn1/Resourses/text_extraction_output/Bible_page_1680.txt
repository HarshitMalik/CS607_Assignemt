  1681    Jeremiah 31 
18  I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast 
 
chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the 
yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my 
   
God. 
19  Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was 
 
instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even 
 
confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 
20  Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake 
   
against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my 
 
bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, 
 
saith the Lord. 
21  ¶ Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart 
 
toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O 
 
virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. 
22  How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the 
 
Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall 
compass a man. 
23  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, As yet they shall 
use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I 
shall bring again their captivity; The Lord bless thee, O habitation 
 
of justice, and mountain of holiness. 
24  And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof 
together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. 
25  For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every 
sorrowful soul. 
26  Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. 
 
The New Covenant 
27  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the house 
of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the 
seed of beast. 
28  And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to 
pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy,
