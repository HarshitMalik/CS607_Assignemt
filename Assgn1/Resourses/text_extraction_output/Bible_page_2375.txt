  2376    Acts 24 
3  we accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all 
thankfulness. 
4  Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray 
thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
5  For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of 
sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader 
of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
 
6  who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, 
 
and would have judged according to our law. 
7  But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence 
took him away out of our hands, 
8  commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of 
 
whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof 
we accuse him. 
9  ¶ And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. 
10  ¶ Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to 
speak, answered, 
Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge 
unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: 
 
11  because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve 
days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
12  And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, 
neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the 
city: 
 
13  neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. 
14  But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call 
heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things 
which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
 
15  and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that 
there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
16  And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of 
offense toward God, and toward men. 
17  Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and 
offerings.
