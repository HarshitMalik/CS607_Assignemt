insight; when it is agitated, it becomes dim.
When  gleefully  wandering  in  states  of  illusion,  who
would say truth is right? When complacently taking it easy
in artificiality, who would say vanity is wrong?
Confusion  and  ignorance  of  the  mind  come  from  the
ground the mind rests on. Even when you pick a place to
live, the intent is to improve your behavior by adapting to
the surroundings. When you are selective in your choice of
friends, that is because you value the potential for positive
benefit.  How  much  the  more  when  you  detach  from  the
realm  of  birth  and  death  to  abide  in  the  ultimate  Way—
how can you not relinquish the former to attain the latter?
Therefore,  when  you  begin  to  study  the  Way,  it  is
necessary  to  sit  calmly,  collect  the  mind,  detach  from
objects,  and  dwell  in  nothingness.  By  dwelling  in
nothingness you are not obsessed with anything at all; thus
you  spontaneously  enter  a  nonresistant  state  of  mind  and
so merge with the Way.
A  scripture  says,  “In  the  supreme  Way  is  silent
nothingness,  with  incomparable  spiritual  functions.  The
substance of mind is also thus.”
The root of the substance of mind is the Way itself; but
because  the  mental  spirit  is  subject  to  influences,  its
obscurity gradually deepens. After flowing in waves for a
long  time,  eventually  the  mind  becomes  separated  from
the Way.
When you clear away the defilement of mind and open
up the conscious spirit, that is called cultivating the Way.
