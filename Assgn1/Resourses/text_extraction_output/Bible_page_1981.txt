A Call to Return to the Lord 
1  In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word 
of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo 
the prophet, saying, 
2  The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers. 
3  Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn 
 
ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith 
the Lord of hosts. 
4  Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have 
cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye now from your 
 
evil ways, and from your evildoings: but they did not hear, nor 
 
hearken unto me, saith the Lord. 
5  Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for 
 
ever? 
 
6  But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants 
the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they 
 
returned and said, Like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us, 
according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt 
with us. 
The Vision of the Horses 
7  Â¶ Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is 
the month Sebat in the second year of Darius, came the word of the 
Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the 
prophet, saying, 
8  I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he 
stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind 
 
him were there red horses, speckled, and white.
