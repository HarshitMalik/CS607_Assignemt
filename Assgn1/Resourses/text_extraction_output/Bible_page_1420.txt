  1421    Proverbs 11 
32  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: 
 
but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness. 
11 
1  A false balance is abomination to the Lord: 
 
but a just weight is his delight. 
2  When pride cometh, then cometh shame: 
 
but with the lowly is wisdom. 
3  The integrity of the upright shall guide them: 
 
but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. 
4  Riches profit not in the day of wrath: 
 
but righteousness delivereth from death. 
5  The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: 
 
but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 
6  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: 
 
but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. 
7  When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: 
 
and the hope of unjust men perisheth. 
8  The righteous is delivered out of trouble, 
and the wicked cometh in his stead. 
9  A hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor: 
 
but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. 
10  When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: 
 
and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 
11  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: 
 
but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 
12  He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor: 
 
but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 
13  A talebearer revealeth secrets: 
 
but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. 
14  Where no counsel is, the people fall: 
 
but in the multitude of counselors there is safety. 
15  He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: 
 
and he that hateth suretyship is sure.
