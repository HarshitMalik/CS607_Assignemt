  1230    Psalms 26 
14  The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; 
 
and he will show them his covenant. 
15  Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord; 
 
for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 
16  Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; 
 
for I am desolate and afflicted. 
17  The troubles of my heart are enlarged: 
 
O bring thou me out of my distresses. 
18  Look upon mine affliction and my pain; 
 
and forgive all my sins. 
19  Consider mine enemies; for they are many; 
   
and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
20  O keep my soul, and deliver me: 
 
let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. 
 
21  Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; 
 
for I wait on thee. 
22  Redeem Israel, O God, 
out of all his troubles.

A Protestation of Integrity 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Judge me, O Lord; 
 
for I have walked in mine integrity: 
 
I have trusted also in the Lord; 
 
therefore I shall not slide. 
2  Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; 
 
try my reins and my heart. 
3  For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes: 
 
and I have walked in thy truth. 
4  I have not sat with vain persons, 
neither will I go in with dissemblers.
