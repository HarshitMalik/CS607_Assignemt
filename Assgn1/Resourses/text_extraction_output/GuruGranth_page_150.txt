Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
The Fear of God is overpowering, and so very heavy, while the intellect is lightweight, 
as is the speech one speaks. So place the Fear of God upon your head, and bear that 
weight; by the Grace of the Merciful Lord, contemplate the Guru.  || 1 ||   Without the 
Fear of God, no one crosses over the world-ocean. This Fear of God adorns the Love of 
the Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The fire of fear within the body is burnt away by the Fear 
of  God.  Through  this  Fear  of  God,  we  are  adorned  with  the  Word  of  the  Shabad. 
Without the Fear of God, all that is fashioned is false. Useless is the mold, and useless 
are the hammer-strokes on the mold.  || 2 ||   The desire for the worldly drama arises 
in the intellect, but even with thousands of clever mental tricks, the heat of the Fear of 
God does not come into play. O Nanak, the speech of the self-willed manmukh is just 
wind. His words are worthless and empty, like the wind.  || 3 || 1 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST 
MEHL:  Place the Fear of God within the home of your heart; with this Fear of God in 
your heart, all other fears shall be frightened away. What sort of fear is that, which 
frightens other fears? Without You, I have other place of rest at all. Whatever happens 
is all according to Your Will.  || 1 ||   Be afraid, if you have any fear, other than the 
Fear of God. Afraid of fear, and living in fear, the mind is held in tumult.  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   The soul does not die; it does not drown, and it does not swim across. The One 
who created everything does everything. By the Hukam of His Command we come, and 
by the Hukam of His Command we go. Before and after, His Command is pervading.  || 
2 ||   Cruelty, attachment, desire and egotism — there is great hunger in these, like the 
raging torrent of a wild stream. Let the Fear of God be your food, drink and support. 
Without doing this, the fools simply die.  || 3 ||   If anyone really has anyone else — 
how  rare  is  that  person!  All  are  Yours  —  You  are  the  Lord  of  all.  All  beings  and 
creatures, wealth and property belong to Him. O Nanak, it is so difficult to describe and 
contemplate Him.  || 4 || 2 ||   GAUREE,  FIRST MEHL:  Let wisdom be your mother, 
and contentment your father. Let Truth be your brother — these are your best relatives.  
|| 1 ||   He has been described, but He cannot be described at all.
