The Blessings of Obedience 
1  Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a 
standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your 
land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God. 
 
2  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
 
Lord. 
3  Â¶ If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do 
them; 
 
4  then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her 
increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
5  And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage 
shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the 
 
full, and dwell in your land safely. 
6  And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none 
shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, 
 
neither shall the sword go through your land. 
7  And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by 
the sword. 
8  And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall 
put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you 
 
by the sword. 
9  For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and 
multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 
10  And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the 
new. 
11  And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not 
 
abhor you. 
12  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be 
my people.  
13  I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land 
of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken 
 
the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
