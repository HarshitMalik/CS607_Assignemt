  1140    Job 7 
7 
Job Remonstrates with God 
1  Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? 
 
Are not his days also like the days of a hireling? 
 
2  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, 
and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work; 
 
3  so am I made to possess months of vanity, 
and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 
4  When I lie down, I say, 
When shall I arise, and the night be gone? 
 
And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 
5  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; 
 
my skin is broken, and become loathsome. 
6  My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, 
and are spent without hope. 
7  O remember that my life is wind: 
 
mine eye shall no more see good. 
8  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: 
 
thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. 
9  As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away; 
 
so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. 
10  He shall return no more to his house, 
neither shall his place know him any more. 
11  Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; 
 
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; 
 
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
12  Am I a sea, or a whale, 
that thou settest a watch over me? 
 
13  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, 
my couch shall ease my complaint; 
 
14  then thou scarest me with dreams, 
and terrifiest me through visions: 
 
15  so that my soul chooseth strangling,
