  334    Numbers 11 
35  ¶ And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, 
Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them 
 
that hate thee flee before thee.  
36  And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many 
thousands of Israel.

The Lord Sends Quails 
1  And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the 
 
Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord 
   
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost 
parts of the camp. 
2  And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the 
 
Lord, the fire was quenched. 
3  And he called the name of the place Taberah [a burning]: because 
 
the fire of the Lord burnt among them. 
4  ¶ And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and 
 
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us 
flesh to eat? 
 
5  We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the 
 
cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the 
garlic: 
 
6  but now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, besides this 
 
manna, before our eyes. 
7  ¶ And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the 
color of bdellium. 
8  And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, 
or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: 
 
and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.  
9  And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell 
upon it.
