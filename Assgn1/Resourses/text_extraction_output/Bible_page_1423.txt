  1424    Proverbs 13 
but a false witness deceit. 
18  There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: 
 
but the tongue of the wise is health. 
19  The lip of truth shall be established for ever: 
 
but a lying tongue is but for a moment. 
20  Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: 
 
but to the counselors of peace is joy. 
21  There shall no evil happen to the just: 
 
but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. 
22  Lying lips are abomination to the Lord: 
 
but they that deal truly are his delight. 
23  A prudent man concealeth knowledge: 
 
but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. 
24  The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: 
 
but the slothful shall be under tribute. 
25  Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: 
 
but a good word maketh it glad. 
26  The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor: 
 
but the way of the wicked seduceth them. 
27  The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: 
 
but the substance of a diligent man is precious. 
28  In the way of righteousness is life; 
 
and in the pathway thereof there is no death. 
13 
1  A wise son heareth his fatherâ€™s instruction: 
 
but a scorner heareth not rebuke. 
2  A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: 
 
but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. 
3  He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: 
 
but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. 
4  The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: 
 
but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. 
5  A righteous man hateth lying:
