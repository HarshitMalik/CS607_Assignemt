16  And Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son, and she called his 
name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his 
   
sons were Ulam and Rakem. 
17  And the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the 
 
son of Machir, the son of Manasseh. 
18  And his sister Hammoleketh bare Ishod, and Abiezer, and 
Mahalah. 
19  And the sons of Shemidah were, Ahian, and Shechem, and Likhi, 
and Aniam. 
The Descendants of Ephraim 
20  Â¶ And the sons of Ephraim; Shuthelah, and Bered his son, and 
 
Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son, 
21  and Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, 
whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because 
they came down to take away their cattle. 
22  And Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren 
came to comfort him. 
23  And when he went in to his wife, she conceived and bare a son, and 
he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house. 
24  (And his daughter was Sherah, who built Beth-horon the nether, 
and the upper, and Uzzen-sherah.) 
25  And Rephah was his son, also Resheph, and Telah his son, and 
Tahan his son, 
26  Laadan his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son, 
27  Non his son, Jehoshuah his son. 
28  And their possessions and habitations were, Beth-el and the towns 
thereof, and eastward Naaran, and westward Gezer, with the towns 
thereof; Shechem also and the towns thereof, unto Gaza and the 
 
towns thereof: 
 
29  and by the borders of the children of Manasseh, Beth-shean and 
her towns, Taanach and her towns, Megiddo and her towns, Dor 
and her towns. In these dwelt the children of Joseph the son of 
Israel.
