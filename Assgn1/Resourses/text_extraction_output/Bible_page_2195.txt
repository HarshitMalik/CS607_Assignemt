  2196    Luke 12 
47  Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your 
 
fathers killed them. 
48  Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for 
 
they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. 
49  Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets 
and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: 
 
50  that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the 
foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
 
51  from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zechariah, which 
perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It 
 
shall be required of this generation. 
52  Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of 
 
knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were 
 
entering in ye hindered. 
53  Â¶ And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the 
Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to 
speak of many things: 
 
54  laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his 
mouth, that they might accuse him.

A Warning against Hypocrisy 
1  In the mean time, when there were gathered together an 
innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one 
upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware 
ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 
2  For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither 
 
hid, that shall not be known.  
3  Therefore, whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in 
the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall 
 
be proclaimed upon the housetops.
