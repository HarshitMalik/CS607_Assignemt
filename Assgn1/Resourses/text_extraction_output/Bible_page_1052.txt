sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old 
man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand. 
 
18  And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the 
treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, 
and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. 
 
19  And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of 
Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and 
destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 
20  And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to 
Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the 
 
reign of the kingdom of Persia: 
 
21  to fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the 
land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she 
 
kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.  
The Proclamation of Cyrus 
22  Â¶ Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the 
Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a 
proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in 
writing, saying, 
23  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath 
the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to 
 
build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there 
among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and 
 
let him go up.
