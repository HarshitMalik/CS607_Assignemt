  1197    Job 41 
and bind their faces in secret. 
14  Then will I also confess unto thee 
that thine own right hand can save thee. 
15  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; 
 
he eateth grass as an ox. 
16  Lo now, his strength is in his loins, 
and his force is in the navel of his belly. 
17  He moveth his tail like a cedar: 
 
the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 
18  His bones are as strong pieces of brass; 
 
his bones are like bars of iron. 
19  He is the chief of the ways of God: 
 
he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 
20  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, 
where all the beasts of the field play. 
21  He lieth under the shady trees, 
in the covert of the reed, and fens. 
22  The shady trees cover him with their shadow; 
 
the willows of the brook compass him about. 
23  Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: 
 
he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
24  He taketh it with his eyes: 
 
his nose pierceth through snares. 
41 
1  Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? 
 
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 
 
2  Canst thou put a hook into his nose? 
 
or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
 
3  Will he make many supplications unto thee? 
 
Will he speak soft words unto thee? 
 
4  Will he make a covenant with thee? 
 
Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
 
5  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
