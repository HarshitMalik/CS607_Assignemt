  2065    Matthew 20 
5  Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did 
likewise. 
6  And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others 
standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day 
idle? 
 
7  They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto

received every man a penny. 
10  But when the first came, they supposed that they should have 
received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. 
 
11  And when they had received it, they murmured against the 
goodman of the house, 
12  saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made 
them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the

13  But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: 
 
didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 
 
14  Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as

15  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine 
 
eye evil, because I am good? 
 
16  So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but 
 
few chosen.
