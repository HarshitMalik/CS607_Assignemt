|| 7 ||   As You cause me to speak, so do I speak, O Lord Master. What other power do 
I have? In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, sing His Praises; they 
are so very dear to God.  || 8 || 1 || 8 ||    
GUJRI,  FIFTH MEHL,  FOURTH HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
O Lord, Man-lion Incarnate, Companion to the poor, Divine Purifier of sinners; O Destroyer 
of fear and dread, Merciful Lord Master, Treasure of Excellence, fruitful is Your service.  || 
1 ||   O Lord, Cherisher of the World, Guru-Lord of the Universe. I seek the Sanctuary of 
Your Feet, O Merciful Lord. Carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   
O Dispeller of sexual desire and anger, Eliminator of intoxication and attachment, Destroyer 
of ego, Honey of the mind; set me free from birth and death, O Sustainer of the earth, and 
preserve my honor, O Embodiment of supreme bliss.  || 2 ||   The many waves of desire 
for  Maya  are  burnt  away,  when  the  Guru‟s  spiritual  wisdom  is  enshrined  in  the  heart, 
through  the  Guru‟s  Mantra.  Destroy  my  egotism,  O  Merciful  Lord;  dispel  my  anxiety,  O 
Infinite Primal Lord.  || 3 ||   Remember in meditation the Almighty Lord, every moment 
and every instant; meditate on God in the celestial peace of Samaadhi. O Merciful to the 
meek, perfectly blissful Lord, I beg for the dust of the feet of the Holy.  || 4 ||   Emotional 
attachment is false, desire is filthy, and longing is corrupt. Please, preserve my faith, dispel 
these doubts from my mind, and save me, O Formless Lord.  || 5 ||   They have become 
wealthy, loaded with the treasures of the Lord‟s riches; they were lacking even clothes. The 
idiotic,  foolish  and  senseless  people  have  become  virtuous  and  patient,  receiving  the 
Gracious Glance of the Lord of wealth.  || 6 ||   Become Jivan-Mukta, liberated while yet 
alive, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, O mind, and maintaining faith in Him in 
your heart. Show kindness and mercy to all beings, and realize that the Lord is pervading 
everywhere; this is the way of life of the enlightened soul, the supreme swan.  || 7 ||   He 
grants the Blessed Vision of His Darshan to those who listen to His Praises, and who, with 
their tongues, chant His Name. They are part and parcel, life and limb with the Lord God; 
O Nanak, they feel the Touch of God, the Savior of sinners.  || 8 || 1 || 2 || 5 || 1 || 1 || 2

GUJRI KI VAAR,  THIRD MEHL,  SUNG IN THE TUNE OF THE VAAR OF 
SIKANDAR & BIRAAHIM:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  This world perishing in attachment and possessiveness; no 
one knows the way of life. One who walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, obtains the 
supreme  status  of  life.  Those  humble  beings  who  focus  their  consciousness  on  the 
Lord‟s Feet, live forever and ever. O Nanak, by His Grace, the Lord abides in the minds 
of the Gurmukhs, who merge in celestial bliss.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  Within the self is 
the pain of doubt; engrossed in worldly affairs, they are killing themselves. Asleep in 
the love of duality, they never wake up; they are in love with, and attached to Maya. 
They do not think of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and they do not contemplate the 
Word of the Shabad.
