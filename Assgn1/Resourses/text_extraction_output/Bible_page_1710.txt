  1711    Jeremiah 44 
my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have 
hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. 
 
11  And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver 
such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to 
 
captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
 
12  And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he 
 
shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array 
 
himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his 
garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 
 
13  He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh [the house of the 
sun], that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the 
 
Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

Jeremiah Prophesies to the Jews in Egypt 
1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which 
dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at 
Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the 
 
evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of 
Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man 
 
dwelleth therein; 
 
3  because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke 
me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other 
gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. 
4  Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early 
and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I 
hate. 
5  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their 
wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
6  Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was 
kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and 
 
they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
