  515    Joshua 10 
23  Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed 
from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for 
the house of my God.

25  And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and

water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, even 
unto this day, in the place which he should choose.
