  595    Judges 16 
afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred 
 
pieces of silver. 
6  And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great 
strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict 
thee. 
7  And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes 
that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
8  Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green 
withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
9  Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. 
And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And 
he brake the withes, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth 
the fire. So his strength was not known. 
10  ¶ And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, 
and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou 
 
mightest be bound. 
11  And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that 
never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
12  Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and 
said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there 
were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from 
off his arms like a thread. 
13  ¶ And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, 
and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And 
 
he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with 
the web. 
14  And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines 
be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went 
away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. 
15  ¶ And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when 
thine heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three 
 
times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. 
16  And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, 
and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
