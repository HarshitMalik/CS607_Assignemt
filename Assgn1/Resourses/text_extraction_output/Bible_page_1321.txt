  1322    Psalms 89 
higher than the kings of the earth.  
28  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, 
and my covenant shall stand fast with him. 
29  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, 
and his throne as the days of heaven. 
30  If his children forsake my law, 
and walk not in my judgments; 
 
31  if they break my statutes, 
and keep not my commandments; 
 
32  then will I visit their transgression with the rod, 
and their iniquity with stripes. 
33  Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, 
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 
34  My covenant will I not break, 
nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
35  Once have I sworn by my holiness 
that I will not lie unto David. 
36  His seed shall endure for ever, 
and his throne as the sun before me. 
37  It shall be established for ever as the moon, 
and as a faithful witness in heaven. 
Selah. 
38  But thou hast cast off and abhorred, 
thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. 
39  Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: 
 
thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 
40  Thou hast broken down all his hedges; 
 
thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin. 
41  All that pass by the way spoil him: 
 
he is a reproach to his neighbors. 
42  Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; 
 
thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 
43  Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, 
and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 
44  Thou hast made his glory to cease,
