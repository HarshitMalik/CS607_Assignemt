  1971    Habakkuk 3 
5  Before him went the pestilence, 
and burning coals went forth at his feet. 
6  He stood, and measured the earth: 
 
he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; 
 
and the everlasting mountains were scattered, 
the perpetual hills did bow: 
 
his ways are everlasting. 
7  I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: 
 
and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. 
8  Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? 
 
Was thine anger against the rivers? 
 
Was thy wrath against the sea, 
that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of 
salvation? 
 
9  Thy bow was made quite naked, 
according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. 
Selah. 
Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. 
10  The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: 
 
the overflowing of the water passed by: 
 
the deep uttered his voice, 
and lifted up his hands on high. 
11  The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: 
 
at the light of thine arrows they went, 
and at the shining of thy glittering spear. 
12  Thou didst march through the land in indignation, 
thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. 
13  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, 
even for salvation with thine anointed; 
 
thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, 
by discovering the foundation unto the neck. 
Selah. 
14  Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: 
 
they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: 
 
their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
