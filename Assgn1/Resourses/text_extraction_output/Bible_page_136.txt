26  ¶ These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring 
out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their 
armies. 
27  These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out 
the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 
 
28  ¶ And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses 
in the land of Egypt, 
29  that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak 
 
thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 
30  And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised 
lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

1  And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to 
Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
 
2  Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother 
 
shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of 
his land.
