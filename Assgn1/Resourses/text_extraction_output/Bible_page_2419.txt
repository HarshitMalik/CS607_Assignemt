  2420    Romans 15 
17  I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those 
things which pertain to God. 
18  For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath 
not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and 
deed, 
19  through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of 
God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I 
 
have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
20  Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was 
named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation: 
 
21  but as it is written, 
To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: 
 
and they that have not heard shall understand.  
Paul Plans to Visit Rome 
22  ¶ For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to 
you.  
23  But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great 
desire these many years to come unto you; 
 
24  whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I 
 
trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way 
thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. 
25  But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 
26  For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a 
certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.  
27  It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the 
 
Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their 
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.  
28  When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them 
this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. 
29  And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the 
fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
