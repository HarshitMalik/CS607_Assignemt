  1379    Psalms 129 
129 
A Prayer for the Overthrow of Zion’s Enemies 
A Song of degrees. 
1  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, 
may Israel now say: 
 
2  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: 
 
yet they have not prevailed against me. 
3  The plowers plowed upon my back: 
 
they made long their furrows. 
4  The Lord is righteous: 
 
he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
5  Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 
6  Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, 
which withereth afore it groweth up: 
 
7  wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; 
 
nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
8  Neither do they which go by say, 
The blessing of the Lord be upon you: 
 
we bless you in the name of the Lord.

Hope in the Lord’s Redemption 
A Song of degrees. 
1  Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. 
2  Lord, hear my voice: 
 
let thine ears be attentive 
to the voice of my supplications. 
3  If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, 
O Lord, who shall stand?
