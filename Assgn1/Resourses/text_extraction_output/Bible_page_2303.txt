Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples 
1  After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the 
sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself. 
 
2  There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and 
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two 
other of his disciples. 
3  Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We 
also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship 
immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  
 
4  ¶ But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; 
 
but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
5  Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They 
 
answered him, No. 
6  And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, 
and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able 
to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  
7  Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the 
Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his 
fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into 
the sea. 
8  And the other disciples came in a little ship, (for they were not far 
from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net 
with fishes. 
9  ¶ As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals 
there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
10  Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
11  Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a 
hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was 
 
not the net broken. 
12  Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples 
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
