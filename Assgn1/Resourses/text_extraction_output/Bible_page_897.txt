  898    2 Kings 24 
6  So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned 
 
in his stead. 
7  And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for 
 
the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the 
river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt. 
Jehoiachin and the Nobles Taken Captive to Babylon 
8  ¶ Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he 
reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother’s name was 
Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
9  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to 
all that his father had done. 
10  ¶ At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon 
came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
11  And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his 
servants did besiege it. 
12  And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, 
he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his 
officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his 
 
reign.  
13  And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the 
Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all 
the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the 
temple of the Lord, as the Lord had said. 
14  And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the 
mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the 
craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the 
 
people of the land. 
15  And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, 
and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, 
those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
16  And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and 
smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them 
the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
