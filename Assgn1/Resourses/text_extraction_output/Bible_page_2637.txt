  2638    Revelation 15 
13  ¶ And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed 
are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the 
 
Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do 
 
follow them. 
The Harvest of the Earth 
14  ¶ And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one 
sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, 
and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
15  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice 
to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the 
 
time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  
 
16  And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and 
 
the earth was reaped. 
17  ¶ And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he 
also having a sharp sickle. 
18  And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over 
fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, 
 
saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the 
vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 
 
19  And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the 
vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of 
God. 
20  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came 
out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a 
thousand and six hundred furlongs. 
15 
The Angels with the Last Plagues 
1  And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven 
angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the 
 
wrath of God.
