  2210    Luke 16 
thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my 
friends: 
 
30  but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy 
living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. 
31  And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I 
have is thine. 
32  It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy 
 
brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

The Parable of the Dishonest Steward 
1  And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, 
which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he 
 
had wasted his goods. 
2  And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of 
thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no 
   
longer steward. 
3  Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord 
 
taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am 
   
ashamed. 
4  I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the 
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
5  So he called every one of his lordâ€™s debtors unto him, and said unto 
the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
 
6  And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, 
Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
7  Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, 
 
A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, 
and write fourscore. 
8  And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done 
wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser 
 
than the children of light.
