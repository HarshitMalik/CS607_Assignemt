  2256    John 6 
34  But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that 
 
ye might be saved. 
35  He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a 
 
season to rejoice in his light. 
36  But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which 
 
the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear 
witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. 
37  And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of 
me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 
38  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, 
 
him ye believe not. 
39  Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and 
   
they are they which testify of me. 
40  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 
41  I receive not honor from men. 
42  But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
43  I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and ye receive me not: if another 
 
shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 
44  How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek 
not the honor that cometh from God only? 
 
45  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that 
 
accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. 
46  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote 
 
of me. 
47  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

The Feeding of the Five Thousand 
1  After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea 
of Tiberias. 
2  And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles 
which he did on them that were diseased.
