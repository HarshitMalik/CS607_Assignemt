  276    Leviticus 20 
20 
The Penalties for Acts of Immorality 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of 
the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that 
giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: 
   
the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
3  And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from 
among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, 
 
to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
4  And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the 
man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not; 
 
5  then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and 
will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit 
whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 
6  ¶ And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and 
after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face 
against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
7  Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord 
 
your God. 
8  And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord which 
 
sanctify you. 
9  For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely 
put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall 
   
be upon him. 
10  ¶ And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, 
even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the 
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.  
11  And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his 
father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their 
   
blood shall be upon them.
