  2301    John 20 
39  And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by 
night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred 
pound weight. 
40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes 
with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
41  Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in 
 
the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 
42  There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jewsâ€™ preparation 
day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

The Resurrection 
1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it 
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away 
from the sepulchre. 
2  Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other 
disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken 
away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they 
have laid him. 
3  Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the 
sepulchre. 
4  So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, 
 
and came first to the sepulchre. 
5  And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; 
 
yet went he not in. 
6  Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the 
sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 
7  and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen 
clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 
8  Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the 
sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 
9  For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from 
the dead.
