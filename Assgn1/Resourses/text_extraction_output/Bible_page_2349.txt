  2350    Acts 15 
17  that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, 
and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, 
saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. 
18  Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the 
world.  
19  Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from 
among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
 
20  but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of 
idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from 
blood.  
21  For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, 
being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. 
22  Â¶ Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to 
send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and 
Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men 
 
among the brethren: 
 
23  and they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and 
 
elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of 
the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: 
 
24  Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us 
have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye 
must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such 
 
commandment: 
 
25  it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send 
chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
26  men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. 
27  We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the 
same things by mouth. 
28  For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no 
greater burden than these necessary things; 
 
29  that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and 
from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep 
 
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
