  1996    Zechariah 11 
11  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite 
the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and 
 
the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt 
shall depart away. 
12  And I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk up 
 
and down in his name, saith the Lord. 
11 
1  Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
2  Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are 
   
spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is 
   
come down. 
3  There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is 
 
spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of 
   
Jordan is spoiled. 
The Foolish Shepherds 
4  ¶ Thus saith the Lord my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 
   
5  whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and 
 
they that sell them say, Blessed be the Lord; for I am rich: and 
   
their own shepherds pity them not. 
6  For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: 
 
but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, 
and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and 
 
out of their hand I will not deliver them. 
7  ¶ And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the 
flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and 
 
the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
 
8  Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed 
 
them, and their soul also abhorred me. 
9  Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that 
   
that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the 
 
flesh of another.
