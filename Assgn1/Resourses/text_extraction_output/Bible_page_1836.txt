  1837    Ezekiel 37 
37 
The Valley of Dry Bones 
1  The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the 
Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley 
which was full of bones, 
2  and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were 
 
very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. 
 
3  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I 
 
answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. 
4  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto 
them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. 
5  Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause 
 
breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 
 
6  and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, 
and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; 
 
and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
7  ¶ So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there 
 
was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, 
bone to his bone. 
8  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon 
them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in 
 
them. 
9  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of 
man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from 
 
the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they 
may live. 
10  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into 
them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding 
great army. 
11  ¶ Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole 
house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope 
 
is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
