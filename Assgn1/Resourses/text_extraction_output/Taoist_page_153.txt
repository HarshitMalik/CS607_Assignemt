which has high and low places, even and uneven places—
how can it be viewed as all the same?
You just have to follow the right pathway and you won’t
go  wrong.  As  long  as  you  don’t  stop  walking,  eventually
you will reach the peak, so why hurry? If you hurry, your
legs and feet will get numb, your head will get dizzy, your
eyesight  will  get  blurry,  and  you  will  gasp  for  breath.
Then, instead of speeding on your way, you have created
obstacles.  Unable  to  go  on,  you  will  give  up  along  the
way. Isn’t that a waste of all your previous effort?
Strive to break through material form, empty your body
and  mind,  and  become  lively  and  fluid.  Don’t  “draw  a
snake with legs on it” and you will naturally not be guilty
of “drawing a tiger like a dog.” Develop your character in
relation  to  the  outside  world  as  much  as  you  can.  When
your practice is accomplished and its results are fulfilled,
then  real  truth  can  be  seen  without  looking,  inherently
containing endless subtleties.
