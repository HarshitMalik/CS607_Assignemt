  2339    Acts 11 
The Church at Antioch 
19  ¶ Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that 
arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and 
Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. 
20  And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when 
they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the 
Lord Jesus. 
21  And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number 
 
believed, and turned unto the Lord. 
22  Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church 
which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he 
 
should go as far as Antioch. 
23  Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and 
exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave 
unto the Lord. 
24  For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and 
 
much people was added unto the Lord. 
25  Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 
 
26  and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it 
came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the 
church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called 
Christians first in Antioch. 
27  ¶ And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 
28  And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by 
the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the 
world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. 
 
29  Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined 
to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea: 
 
30  which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of 
Barnabas and Saul.
