  371    Numbers 24 
5  How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, 
and thy tabernacles, O Israel! 
 
6  As the valleys are they spread forth, 
as gardens by the river’s side, 
as the trees of lignaloes which the Lord hath planted, 
and as cedar trees beside the waters. 
7  He shall pour the water out of his buckets, 
and his seed shall be in many waters, 
and his king shall be higher than Agag, 
and his kingdom shall be exalted. 
8  God brought him forth out of Egypt; 
 
he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn: 
 
he shall eat up the nations his enemies, 
and shall break their bones, 
and pierce them through with his arrows. 
9  He couched, he lay down as a lion, 
and as a great lion: who shall stir him up?  
   
Blessed is he that blesseth thee, 
and cursed is he that curseth thee.  
Balaam’s Prophecy 
10  ¶ And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his 
hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse 
 
mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these 
three times. 
11  Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee 
 
unto great honor; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from 
 
honor. 
12  And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers 
which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
13  If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go 
beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of 
mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak?
