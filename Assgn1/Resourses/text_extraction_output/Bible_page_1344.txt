  1345    Psalms 106 
11  And the waters covered their enemies: 
 
there was not one of them left. 
12  Then believed they his words;  
 
they sang his praise.  
13  They soon forgat his works; 
 
they waited not for his counsel: 
 
14  but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, 
and tempted God in the desert. 
15  And he gave them their request; 
 
but sent leanness into their soul.  
16  They envied Moses also in the camp, 
and Aaron the saint of the Lord. 
17  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
and covered the company of Abiram. 
18  And a fire was kindled in their company; 
 
the flame burned up the wicked.  
19  They made a calf in Horeb, 
and worshipped the molten image. 
20  Thus they changed their glory 
into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
21  They forgat God their saviour, 
which had done great things in Egypt; 
 
22  wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
and terrible things by the Red sea. 
23  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, 
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, 
to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.  
24  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, 
they believed not his word: 
 
25  but murmured in their tents, 
and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord. 
26  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, 
to overthrow them in the wilderness:  
 
27  to overthrow their seed also among the nations, 
and to scatter them in the lands.
