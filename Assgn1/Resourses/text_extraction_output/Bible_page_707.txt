the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from 
the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. 
13  And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord had 
gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 
14  And David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David 
 
was girded with a linen ephod. 
15  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord 
with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 
16  ¶ And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal 
Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David 
leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her 
 
heart. 
17  And they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in his place, in 
the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David 
 
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. 
18  And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings 
and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord 
of hosts. 
19  And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole 
multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a 
cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all 
the people departed every one to his house. 
20  ¶ Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the 
daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious 
was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the 
eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows 
shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
 
21  And David said unto Michal, It was before the Lord, which chose 
me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler 
over the people of the Lord, over Israel: therefore will I play 
 
before the Lord. 
22  And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own 
sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them 
 
shall I be had in honor.
