  1134    Job 3 
12  Why did the knees prevent me? 
 
Or why the breasts that I should suck? 
 
13  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, 
I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 
 
14  with kings and counselors of the earth, 
which built desolate places for themselves; 
 
15  or with princes that had gold, 
who filled their houses with silver: 
 
16  or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; 
 
as infants which never saw light. 
17  There the wicked cease from troubling; 
 
and there the weary be at rest. 
18  There the prisoners rest together; 
 
they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 
19  The small and great are there; 
 
and the servant is free from his master. 
20  Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, 
and life unto the bitter in soul; 
 
21  which long for death, but it cometh not;  
 
and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
 
22  which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, 
when they can find the grave? 
 
23  Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, 
and whom God hath hedged in? 
 
24  For my sighing cometh before I eat, 
and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
25  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, 
and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 
26  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, 
neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
