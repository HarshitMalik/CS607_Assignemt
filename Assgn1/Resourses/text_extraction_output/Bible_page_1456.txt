  1457    Proverbs 30 
he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. 
6  Add thou not unto his words, 
lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. 
7  Two things have I required of thee; 
 
deny me them not before I die: 
 
8  remove far from me vanity and lies; 
 
give me neither poverty nor riches; 
 
feed me with food convenient for me: 
 
9  lest I be full, and deny thee, 
and say, Who is the Lord? 
 
or lest I be poor, and steal, 
and take the name of my God in vain. 
10  Accuse not a servant unto his master, 
lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. 
11  There is a generation that curseth their father, 
and doth not bless their mother. 
12  There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, 
and yet is not washed from their filthiness. 
13  There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! 
 
And their eyelids are lifted up. 
14  There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, 
and their jaw teeth as knives, 
to devour the poor from off the earth, 
and the needy from among men. 
15  The horseleech hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. 
There are three things that are never satisfied, 
yea, four things say not, It is enough: 
 
16  the grave; and the barren womb; 
   
the earth that is not filled with water; 
 
and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 
17  The eye that mocketh at his father, 
and despiseth to obey his mother, 
the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, 
and the young eagles shall eat it. 
18  There be three things which are too wonderful for me,
