  1444    Proverbs 23 
and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 
15  My son, if thine heart be wise, 
my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 
16  Yea, my reins shall rejoice, 
when thy lips speak right things. 
17  Let not thine heart envy sinners; 
 
but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long. 
18  For surely there is an end; 
 
and thine expectation shall not be cut off. 
19  Hear thou, my son, and be wise, 
and guide thine heart in the way. 
20  Be not among winebibbers; 
 
among riotous eaters of flesh: 
 
21  for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: 
 
and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. 
22  Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, 
and despise not thy mother when she is old. 
23  Buy the truth, and sell it not; 
 
also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 
24  The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: 
 
and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. 
25  Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, 
and she that bare thee shall rejoice. 
26  My son, give me thine heart, 
and let thine eyes observe my ways. 
27  For a whore is a deep ditch; 
 
and a strange woman is a narrow pit. 
28  She also lieth in wait as for a prey, 
and increaseth the transgressors among men. 
29  Who hath woe? 
 
Who hath sorrow? 
 
Who hath contentions? 
 
Who hath babbling? 
 
Who hath wounds without cause? 
 
Who hath redness of eyes?
