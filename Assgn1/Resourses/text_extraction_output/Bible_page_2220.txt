  2221    Luke 19 
29  And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and 
Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his 
disciples, 
30  saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your 
 
entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose 
 
him, and bring him hither. 
31  And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say 
 
unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. 
32  And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had 
said unto them. 
33  And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto 
them, Why loose ye the colt? 
 
34  And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
35  And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon 
 
the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
36  And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
37  And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount 
of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and 
praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had 
seen; 
 
38  saying, 
Blessed be the King 
that cometh in the name of the Lord:  
 
peace in heaven, 
and glory in the highest. 
39  And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto 
him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
40  And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should 
hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. 
41  Â¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
42  saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the 
things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine 
 
eyes.
