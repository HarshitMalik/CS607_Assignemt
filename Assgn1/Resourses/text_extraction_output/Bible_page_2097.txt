  2098    Mark 1 
23  And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and 
 
he cried out, 
24  saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of 
 
Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, 
   
the Holy One of God. 
25  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of 
him. 
26  And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud 
voice, he came out of him. 
27  And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among 
themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? 
   
for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and 
they do obey him. 
28  And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region 
round about Galilee. 
Jesus Heals Simon’s Mother-in-Law 
29  ¶ And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they 
entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
30  But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and anon they tell 
 
him of her. 
31  And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and 
 
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 
Jesus Heals Many at Evening 
32  ¶ And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that 
were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 
33  And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
34  And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out 
many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they 
 
knew him.
