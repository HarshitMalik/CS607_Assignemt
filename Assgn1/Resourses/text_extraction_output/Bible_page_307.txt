  308    Numbers 3 
14  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, 
saying, 
15  Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by 
their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou 
 
number them. 
16  And Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as 
he was commanded. 
17  And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and 
 
Kohath, and Merari. 
18  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; 
 
Libni, and Shimei. 
19  And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, 
 
Hebron, and Uzziel. 
20  And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These 
 
are the families of the Levites according to the house of their 
fathers. 
21  ¶ Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the 
Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. 
 
22  Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all 
the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were 
numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. 
23  The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle 
westward. 
24  And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be 
Eliasaph the son of Lael. 
25  And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the 
congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering 
thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation, 
26  and the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the 
court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and 
the cords of it, for all the service thereof. 
27  ¶ And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family 
of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family 
of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.
