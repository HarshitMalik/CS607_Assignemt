  1733    Jeremiah 51 
35  The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the 
inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of 
 
Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. 
36  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and 
 
take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her 
 
springs dry. 
37  And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an 
astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant. 
38  They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps. 
 
39  In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them 
drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not 
wake, saith the Lord. 
40  I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with 
he goats. 
41  ¶ How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth 
 
surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the 
 
nations! 
 
42  The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the 
 
multitude of the waves thereof. 
43  Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land 
wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass 
thereby. 
44  And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his 
mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not 
 
flow together any more unto him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall 
 
fall. 
45  ¶ My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every 
man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord. 
46  And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumor that shall be 
heard in the land; a rumor shall both come one year, and after that 
 
in another year shall come a rumor, and violence in the land, ruler 
against ruler. 
47  Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the 
graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be 
 
confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
