  2611    3 John 1 
The Good Report concerning Demetrius 
11  ¶ Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He 
that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
 
12  Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, 
 
and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. 
 
Final Greetings 
13  ¶ I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write 
unto thee: 
 
14  but I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. 
¶ Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by 
name.
