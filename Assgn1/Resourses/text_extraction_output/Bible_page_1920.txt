  1921    Hosea 14 
13  The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an 
 
unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking 
 
forth of children. 
14  I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem 
 
them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be 
   
thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. 
 
15  ¶ Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall 
come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, 
and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: 
 
he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. 
16  Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her 
 
God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in 
   
pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. 
14 
Israel Entreated to Return to the Lord 
1  O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by 
 
thine iniquity. 
2  Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take 
 
away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the 
 
calves of our lips. 
3  Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will 
   
we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in 
 
thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 
4  ¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine 
 
anger is turned away from him. 
5  I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast 
 
forth his roots as Lebanon. 
6  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, 
and his smell as Lebanon. 
7  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as 
 
the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine 
 
of Lebanon.
