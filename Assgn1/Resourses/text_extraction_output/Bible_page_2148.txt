  2149    Mark 16 
11  And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been 
seen of her, believed not. 
Jesus Appears to Two Disciples 
12  ¶ After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they 
walked, and went into the country. 
13  And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they 
 
them. 
Jesus Commissions the Eleven 
14  ¶ Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and 
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because 
they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. 
15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the 
gospel to every creature.  
16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that 
 
believeth not shall be damned. 
17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall 
 
they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 
   
18  they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it 
 
shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall 
 
recover. 
The Ascension 
19  ¶ So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up 
into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. 
20  And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working 
with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
