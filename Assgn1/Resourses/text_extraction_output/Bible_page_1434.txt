  1435    Proverbs 19 
but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him. 
18  The lot causeth contentions to cease, 
and parteth between the mighty. 
19  A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: 
 
and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. 
20  A manâ€™s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; 
 
and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 
21  Death and life are in the power of the tongue: 
 
and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 
22  Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, 
and obtaineth favor of the Lord. 
23  The poor useth entreaties; 
 
but the rich answereth roughly. 
24  A man that hath friends must show himself friendly: 
 
and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. 
19 
1  Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, 
than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 
2  Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; 
 
and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. 
3  The foolishness of man perverteth his way: 
 
and his heart fretteth against the Lord. 
4  Wealth maketh many friends; 
 
but the poor is separated from his neighbor. 
5  A false witness shall not be unpunished; 
 
and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. 
6  Many will entreat the favor of the prince: 
 
and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 
7  All the brethren of the poor do hate him: 
 
how much more do his friends go far from him? 
 
He pursueth them with words, 
yet they are wanting to him. 
8  He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
