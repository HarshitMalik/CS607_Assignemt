The arrow is turned around, and kills the one who shot it.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  The 
eyes which are attracted by the Lord‟s Love behold the Lord through the Name of the 
Lord. If they gaze upon something else, O servant Nanak, they ought to be gouged out.  
|| 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Infinite Lord totally permeates the water, the land and the sky. 
He cherishes and sustains all beings and creatures; whatever He does comes to pass. 
Without Him, we have no mother, father, children, sibling or friend. He is permeating 
and pervading deep within each and every heart; let everyone meditate on Him. Let all 
chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, who is manifest all over the world.  
|| 13 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  Those Gurmukhs who meet as friends are blessed 
with the Lord God‟s Love. O servant Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; 
you shall go to His court in joyous high spirits.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  Lord, You are 
the Great Giver of all; all beings are Yours. They all worship You in adoration; You bless 
them with Your Bounty, O Beloved. The Generous Lord, the Great Giver reaches out 
with  His Hands, and the rain  pours down on the world. The corn  germinates in  the 
fields; contemplate the Lord‟s Name with love. Servant Nanak begs for the Gift of the 
Support of the Name of his Lord God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The desires of the mind are 
satisfied, meditating on the Ocean of Peace. Worship and adore the Feet of the Lord, 
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the jewel mine. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the 
Company of the Holy, one is saved, and the Decree of Death is torn up. The treasure of 
this human life is won, meditating on the Lord of Detachment. Let everyone seek the 
Sanctuary of the True Guru; let the black spot of pain, the scar of suffering, be erased.  
|| 14 ||   SHALOK,  FOURTH MEHL:  I was seeking, searching for my Friend, but my 
Friend  is  right  here  with  me.  O  servant  Nanak,  the  Unseen  is  not  seen,  but  the 
Gurmukh is given to see Him.  || 1 ||   FOURTH MEHL:  O Nanak, I am in love with the 
True Lord; I cannot survive without Him. Meeting the True Guru, the Perfect Lord is 
found, and the tongue savors His Sublime Essence.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Some sing, some 
listen,  and  some  speek  and  preach.  The  filth  and  pollution  of  countless  lifetimes  is 
washed  away,  and  the  wishes  of  the  mind  are  fulfilled.  Coming  and  going  in 
reincarnation ceases, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. They save themselves, 
and save their companions; they save all their generations as well. Servant Nanak is a 
sacrifice to those who are pleasing to my Lord God.  || 15 || 1 ||  SUDH  ||

Such  is  the  Sovereign  Lord,  the  Inner-knower,  the  Searcher  of  Hearts;  He  sees

each and every heart; no stain or stigma sticks to Him. He is liberated from bondage; 
He does not belong to any social class.  || 1 ||   As one‟s face is reflected in the water, 
so does Naam Dayv‟s Beloved Lord and Master appear.  || 2 || 1 ||
