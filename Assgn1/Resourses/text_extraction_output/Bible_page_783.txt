  784    1 Kings 8 
29  that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even 
toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: 
 
that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall 
make toward this place. 
30  And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy 
people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear 
 
thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. 
 
31  ¶ If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon 
him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in 
this house: 
 
32  then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, 
condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and 
 
justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 
33  ¶ When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, 
because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, 
and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee 
in this house: 
 
34  then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, 
and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their 
fathers. 
35  ¶ When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have 
sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy 
 
name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
 
36  then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and 
of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein 
they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast 
given to thy people for an inheritance. 
37  ¶ If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, 
mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege 
 
them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever 
 
sickness there be; 
 
38  what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all 
thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his 
own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
