  1506    Isaiah 8 
8 
Let the Lord Be Your Fear 
1  Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write 
in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz [in 
making speed to the spoil he hasteneth the prey]. 
2  And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, 
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
3  And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. 
 
Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 
4  For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my 
mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be 
taken away before the king of Assyria. 
5  ¶ The Lord spake also unto me again, saying, 
6  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go 
softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 
 
7  now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters 
of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his 
glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his 
 
banks: 
 
8  and he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he 
 
shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings 
 
shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. 
9  ¶ Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in 
pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye 
   
shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in 
 
pieces. 
10  Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, 
 
and it shall not stand: for God is with us. 
 
11  ¶ For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and 
instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, 
saying, 
12  Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, 
A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
