  2492    Ephesians 3 
6  that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and 
partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.  
7  ¶ Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace 
of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 
8  Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, 
that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of 
Christ; 
 
9  and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, 
which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who 
created all things by Jesus Christ: 
 
10  to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in 
heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold 
wisdom of God, 
11  according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus 
our Lord: 
 
12  in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith 
of him. 
13  Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, 
which is your glory. 
Prayer for Love Which Surpasses Knowledge 
14  ¶ For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, 
15  of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
16  that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be 
strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 
 
17  that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted 
 
and grounded in love, 
18  may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and 
length, and depth, and height; 
 
19  and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye 
might be filled with all the fulness of God. 
20  ¶ Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all 
that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
