  2463    2 Corinthians 6 
The Ministry of Reconciliation 
11  ¶ Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but 
 
we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest 
 
in your consciences. 
12  For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you 
occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to 
answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
13  For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be 
 
sober, it is for your cause. 
14  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if 
 
one died for all, then were all dead: 
 
15  and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth 
live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose 
again. 
16  ¶ Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, 
 
though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth 
know we him no more. 
17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things 
 
are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 
 
18  And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by 
Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
 
19  to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, 
not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto 
 
us the word of reconciliation. 
20  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did 
beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to 
 
God. 
21  For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we 
 
might be made the righteousness of God in him.

1  We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye 
receive not the grace of God in vain.
