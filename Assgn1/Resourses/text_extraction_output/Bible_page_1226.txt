  1227    Psalms 23 
26  The meek shall eat and be satisfied: 
 
they shall praise the Lord that seek him: 
 
your heart shall live for ever. 
27  All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord: 
 
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 
28  For the kingdom is the Lord’s: 
 
and he is the governor among the nations. 
29  All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: 
 
all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: 
 
and none can keep alive his own soul. 
30  A seed shall serve him; 
 
it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. 
31  They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness 
unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

The Lord Is My Shepherd 
A Psalm of David. 
1  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
 
2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: 
 
he leadeth me beside the still waters.  
3  He restoreth my soul: 
 
he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; 
   
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 
5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: 
 
thou anointest my head with oil; 
 
my cup runneth over. 
6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: 
 
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
