  2314    Acts 3 
13  The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our 
fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and 
 
denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to 
let him go. 
14  But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to 
be granted unto you;  
 
15  and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; 
 
whereof we are witnesses. 
16  And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man 
strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath 
 
given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
17  Â¶ And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did 
also your rulers. 
18  But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all 
his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. 
19  Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be 
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the 
presence of the Lord; 
 
20  and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto 
you: 
 
21  whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all 
things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy 
prophets since the world began. 
22  For Moses truly said unto the fathers, 
A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your 
brethren, like unto me; 
 
him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.  
23  And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that 
Prophet, 
shall be destroyed from among the people.  
24  Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, 
as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 
25  Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God 
made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall 
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
