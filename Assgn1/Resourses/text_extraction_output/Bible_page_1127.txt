21  to establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth 
day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 
22  as the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the 
month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from 
mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of 
 
feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts 
to the poor. 
23  ¶ And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai 
had written unto them; 
 
24  because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of 
all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had 
cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 
 
25  but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters 
that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should 
return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be 
hanged on the gallows. 
26  Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. 
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had 
seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, 
27  the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and 
upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not 
fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, 
and according to their appointed time every year; 
 
28  and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout 
every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and 
 
that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor 
the memorial of them perish from their seed. 
29  ¶ Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai 
the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of 
Purim. 
30  And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and 
seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace 
and truth, 
31  to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as 
Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as
