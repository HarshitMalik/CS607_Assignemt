Constantly and continuously, I serve the Lord‟s humble servant, who recites the sermon 
of the Lord, Har, Har. Hail, hail unto the Guru, the Guru, the Perfect True Guru, who 
fulfills the desires of Nanak‟s mind.  || 4 ||   Let me meet the Guru, my best friend, O 
Lord; meeting Him, I meditate on the Lord‟s Name. I seek the Lord‟s sermon from the 
Guru, the True Guru; joining with Him, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Each and 
every day, forever, I sing the Lord‟s Praises; my mind lives by hearing Your Name. O 
Nanak, that moment when I forget my Lord and Master — at that moment, my soul 
dies.  || 5 ||   Everyone longs to see the Lord, but he alone sees Him, whom the Lord 
causes to see Him. One upon whom my Beloved bestows His Glance of Grace cherishes 
the Lord, Har, Har forever. He alone cherishes the Lord, Har, Har, forever and ever, 
who meets my Perfect True Guru. O Nanak, the Lord‟s humble servant and the Lord 
become One; meditating on the Lord, he blends with the Lord.  || 6 || 1 || 3 ||

His Court is the most lofty and exalted. It has no end or limitations. Millions, millions, 
tens of millions seek, but they cannot find even a tiny bit of His Mansion.  || 1 ||   What 
is  that  auspicious  moment,  when  God  is  met?    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||      Thousands  of 
devotees  worship  and  adore  Him.  Thousands  of  ascetics  practice  austere  discipline. 
Thousands of Yogis practice Yoga. Thousands of pleasure seekers enjoy pleasures.  || 2 
||   He dwells in each and every heart, but only a few know this. Is there any friend 
who  can  rip  apart  the  screen  of  separation?  I  can  only  make  the  effort  if  God  is 
merciful. I sacrifice my body and soul to Him.  || 3 ||   After wandering around for so 
long, I have finally come to the Saints; all my pains and doubts have been eradicated. 
God summoned me to the Mansion of His Presence, and blessed me with the Ambrosial 
Nectar  of  His  Name.  Says  Nanak,  my  God  is  lofty  and  exalted.    ||  4  ||  1  ||   
WADAHANS,    FIFTH  MEHL:    Blessed  is  that  time,  when  the  Blessed  Vision  of  His 
Darshan is given; I am a sacrifice to the feet of the True Guru.  || 1 ||   You are the 
Giver of souls, O my Beloved God. My mind lives by reflecting upon the Name of God.  
|| 1 ||  Pause  ||   Your Mantra is True, and the Word of Your Bani is Ambrosial Nectar. 
Your  Presence  is  cooling  and  soothing;  Your  gaze  is  all-knowing.    ||  2  ||      Your 
Command is true; You sit upon the eternal throne. My God is eternal; He does not come 
and go.  || 3 ||   You are merciful; I am Your humble servant. O Nanak, the Lord and 
Master  is  totally  permeating  and  pervading  everywhere.    ||  4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  
FIFTH MEHL:  You are infinite — only a few know this. By Guru‟s Grace, some come to 
understand You through the Word of the Shabad.  || 1 ||
