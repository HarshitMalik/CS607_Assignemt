  559    Judges 3 
3 
The Nations Left to Test Israel 
1  Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by 
them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of 
Canaan; 
 
2  only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to 
teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
 
3  namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the 
Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from 
mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
4  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they 
would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he 
commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
5  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, 
and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
 
6  and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their 
daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
Othniel Delivers Israel from Chushan-rishathaim 
7  ¶ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and 
forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 
8  Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold 
them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: 
 
and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years. 
9  And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord 
raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, 
even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. 
10  And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, 
and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushan-rishathaim 
 
king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against 
 
Chushan-rishathaim.
