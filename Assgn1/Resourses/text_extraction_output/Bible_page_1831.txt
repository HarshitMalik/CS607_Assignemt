  1832    Ezekiel 35 
28  And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the 
beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none 
 
shall make them afraid. 
29  And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no 
more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of 
the heathen any more. 
30  Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and 
that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord 
God. 
31  And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your 
God, saith the Lord God.

The Prophecy against Mount Seir 
1  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against 
it, 
3  and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O mount Seir, I 
 
am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and 
I will make thee most desolate. 
4  I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt 
know that I am the Lord. 
5  Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of 
the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their 
calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: 
 
6  therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will prepare thee unto 
blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated 
 
blood, even blood shall pursue thee. 
7  Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him 
that passeth out and him that returneth. 
8  And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in 
 
thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with 
the sword.
