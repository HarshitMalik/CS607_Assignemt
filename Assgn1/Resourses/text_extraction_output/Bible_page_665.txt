  666    1 Samuel 20 
18  Â¶ So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and 
told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went 
and dwelt in Naioth. 
19  And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah. 
20  And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the 
 
company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as 
appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of 
Saul, and they also prophesied. 
21  And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they 
prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third 
time, and they prophesied also. 
22  Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in 
Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And 
   
one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. 
23  And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God 
 
was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came 
to Naioth in Ramah. 
24  And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel 
in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. 
Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

The Friendship of David and Jonathan 
1  And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before 
Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is 
   
my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? 
 
2  And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my 
   
father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it 
me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 
   
3  And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth 
that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not 
 
Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly, as the Lord
