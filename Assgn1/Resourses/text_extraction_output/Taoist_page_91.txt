CALMNESS
A proverb says that sages accomplish the ultimate human
attainment  based  on  calmness.  The  ultimate  attainment  is
great  balance  as  a  human  being.  Sages  are  based  in
calmness, not because they think calmness is good and so
they focus on it, but because nothing disturbs their minds.
They are naturally calm without seeking calmness.
People seeking calmness today have not gotten the true
tradition.  They  all  say  to  chain  the  mind-monkey  tightly
and tether the idea-horse fast.
When  they  find  they  cannot  chain  or  tether  it  down,
finally  they  say  the  mind  is  ultimately  ungraspable  and
thus calm. They do not even reflect that this practice is a
mistake that is due to failure to attain knowledge.
When  you  attain  knowledge,  you  are  clear.  When  you
are clear, you see that all truths in the world are settled and
do not admit of any subjective ideas at all. This is what is
known  as  having  stability  after  knowing  where  to  stop.
After you are stable, you can be calm. After you are calm,
you can be at peace.
Externally, if you forget fame and profit, your body will
be  at  peace.  Inwardly,  if  you  forget  cogitation  and
rumination, your mind will be at peace.
Everyone says that physical security is a blessing; I say
that peace of mind is the Way.
