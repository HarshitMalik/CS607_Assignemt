  1533    Isaiah 25 
19  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the 
earth is moved exceedingly. 
20  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be 
removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy 
 
upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. 
 
21  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish 
the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth 
upon the earth. 
22  And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in 
the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall 
they be visited. 
23  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when 
the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and 
before his ancients gloriously.

Praise for the Lord’s Favor 
1  O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; 
   
for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are 
 
faithfulness and truth. 
2  For thou hast made of a city a heap; of a defensed city a ruin: a 
   
palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. 
 
3  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the 
terrible nations shall fear thee. 
4  For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in 
his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when 
the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. 
5  Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry 
place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the 
   
terrible ones shall be brought low. 
6  ¶ And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all 
people a feast of fat things; a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things 
 
full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
