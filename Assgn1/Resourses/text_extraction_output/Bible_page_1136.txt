  1137    Job 5 
marvelous things without number: 
 
10  who giveth rain upon the earth, 
and sendeth waters upon the fields: 
 
11  to set up on high those that be low; 
 
that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 
12  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, 
so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. 
13  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:  
 
and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 
14  They meet with darkness in the daytime, 
and grope in the noonday as in the night. 
15  But he saveth the poor from the sword, 
from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
16  So the poor hath hope, 
and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
17  Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: 
 
therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:  
 
18  for he maketh sore, and bindeth up: 
 
he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 
19  He shall deliver thee in six troubles: 
 
yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 
20  In famine he shall redeem thee from death: 
 
and in war from the power of the sword. 
21  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: 
 
neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
22  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: 
 
neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
23  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: 
 
and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
24  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; 
 
and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 
25  Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, 
and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. 
26  Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, 
like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
