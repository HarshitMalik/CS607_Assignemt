THE YOGA OF THE DIVINE GLORIES
Sarvametadritam manye yanmaam vadasi keshava;
Na hi te bhagavan vyaktim vidurdevaa na daanavaah.
14. I believe all this that Thou sayest to me as true, O Krishna! Verily, O blessed Lord,
neither the gods nor the demons know Thy manifestation (origin)!
Swayamevaatmanaatmaanam vettha twam purushottama;
Bhootabhaavana bhootesha devadeva jagatpate.
15. Verily, Thou Thyself knowest Thyself by Thyself, O Supreme Person, O source and
Lord of beings, O God of gods, O ruler of the world!
Vaktum arhasyasheshena divyaa hyaatmavibhootayah;
Yaabhir vibhootibhir lokaanimaamstwam vyaapya tishthasi.
16. Thou shouldst indeed tell, without reserve, of Thy divine glories by which Thou
existeth, pervading all these worlds. (None else can do so.)
Katham vidyaamaham yogimstwaam sadaa parichintayan;
Keshu keshu cha bhaaveshu chintyo’si bhagavanmayaa.
17. How shall I, ever meditating, know Thee, O Yogin? In what aspects or things, O blessed
Lord, art Thou to be thought of by me?
Vistarenaatmano yogam vibhootim cha janaardana;
Bhooyah kathaya triptirhi shrinvato naasti me’mritam.
18. Tell me again in detail, O Krishna, of Thy Yogic power and glory; for I am not satisfied
with what I have heard of Thy life-giving and nectar-like speech!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Hanta te kathayishyaami divyaa hyaatmavibhootayah;
Praadhaanyatah kurushreshtha naastyanto vistarasya me.
The Blessed Lord said:
19. Very well, now I will declare to thee My divine glories in their prominence, O Arjuna!
There is no end to their detailed description.
COMMENTARY: The Lord’s divine glories are illimitable.
Ahamaatmaa gudaakesha sarvabhootaashayasthitah;
Ahamaadishcha madhyam cha bhootaanaamanta eva cha.
20. I am the Self, O Gudakesha, seated in the hearts of all beings! I am the beginning, the
middle and also the end of all beings.
