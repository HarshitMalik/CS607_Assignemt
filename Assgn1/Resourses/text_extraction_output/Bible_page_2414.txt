  2415    Romans 13 
8  or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it 
 
with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth 
   
mercy, with cheerfulness.  
9  ¶ Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; 
 
cleave to that which is good. 
10  Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor 
 
preferring one another; 
 
11  not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
     
12  rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in 
   
prayer; 
 
13  distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. 
 
14  ¶ Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. 
 
15  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. 
16  Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, 
but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own 
conceits.  
17  Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the 
sight of all men. 
18  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all 
men. 
19  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto 
wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the 
   
Lord.  
20  Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him 
 
drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  
 
21  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. 
13 
1  Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no 
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
 
2  Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of 
God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
