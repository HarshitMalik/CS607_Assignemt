  479    Deuteronomy 29 
7  And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and 
Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we 
smote them: 
 
8  and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the 
Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.  
9  Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye 
may prosper in all that ye do. 
10  ¶ Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your 
 
captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the 
men of Israel, 
11  your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, 
from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: 
 
12  that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God, 
and into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this 
day: 
 
13  that he may establish thee today for a people unto himself, and that 
he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he 
hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
14  ¶ Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 
 
15  but with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord 
our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 
 
16  (for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we 
 
came through the nations which ye passed by; 
 
17  and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and 
stone, silver and gold, which were among them:) 
 
18  lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, 
whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go 
and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you 
 
a root that beareth gall and wormwood;  
 
19  and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that 
he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I 
walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to 
thirst: 
 
20  the Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and 
his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that
