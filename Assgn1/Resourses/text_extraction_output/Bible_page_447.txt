  448    Deuteronomy 16 
9  ¶ Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the 
 
seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the 
corn. 
10  And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord thy God 
with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt 
give unto the Lord thy God, according as the Lord thy God hath 
blessed thee: 
 
11  and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son, 
and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and 
the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the 
fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which 
the Lord thy God hath chosen to place his name there. 
12  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and 
 
thou shalt observe and do these statutes. 
13  ¶ Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that 
thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 
 
14  and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy 
daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the 
Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are 
within thy gates. 
15  Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God 
in the place which the Lord shall choose: because the Lord thy 
 
God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of 
thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. 
16  ¶ Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord 
thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of 
 
unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of 
tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the Lord empty: 
   
17  every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the 
Lord thy God which he hath given thee.
