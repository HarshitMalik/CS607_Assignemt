56  And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested 
 
the sabbath day according to the commandment.

The Resurrection 
1  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, 
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had 
prepared, and certain others with them. 
2  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
3  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
4  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, 
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
 
5  and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, 
they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
 
6  He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you 
 
when he was yet in Galilee, 
7  saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful 
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.  
8  And they remembered his words, 
9  and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the 
eleven, and to all the rest. 
10  It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, 
and other women that were with them, which told these things unto 
the apostles. 
11  And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed 
them not. 
12  Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, 
 
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, 
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
