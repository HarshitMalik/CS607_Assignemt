  1565    Isaiah 41 
12  Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that 
contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as 
 
nothing, and as a thing of nought. 
13  For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, 
Fear not; I will help thee. 
 
14  ¶ Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, 
 
saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 
15  Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having 
teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and 
 
shalt make the hills as chaff. 
16  Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the 
whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, 
 
and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. 
17  ¶ When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their 
tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of 
Israel will not forsake them. 
18  I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the 
valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land 
 
springs of water. 
19  I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the 
myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the 
 
pine, and the box tree together: 
 
20  that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand 
together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy 
One of Israel hath created it. 
The Lord’s Challenge to False Gods 
21  ¶ Produce your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your strong 
 
reasons, saith the King of Jacob. 
22  Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let 
 
them show the former things, what they be, that we may consider 
them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to 
 
come.
