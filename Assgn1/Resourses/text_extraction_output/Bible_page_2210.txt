  2211    Luke 16 
9  And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of 
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into 
 
everlasting habitations. 
10  ¶ He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: 
 
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 
11  If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, 
who will commit to your trust the true riches? 
 
12  And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, 
who shall give you that which is your own? 
 
13  No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, 
 
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the 
 
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  
14  ¶ And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: 
 
and they derided him. 
15  And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before 
men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly 
   
esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. 
The Law and the Kingdom of God 
16  ¶ The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the 
 
kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.  
17  And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the 
law to fail.  
Jesus’ Teaching on Divorce 
18  ¶ Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, 
committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away 
 
from her husband committeth adultery.  
The Rich Man and Lazarus 
19  ¶ There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and 
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
