Those who have faith in the Name of the Fearless Lord, O my soul — all their enemies 
and attackers speak against them in vain. Nanak serves the Perfect Guru, O my soul, 
who causes all to fall at His feet.  || 3 ||   So serve such a Lord continuously, O my soul, 
who is the Great Lord and Master of all. Those who single-mindedly worship Him in 
adoration, O my soul, are not subservient to anyone. Serving the Guru, I have obtained 
the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, O my soul; all the slanderers and trouble-makers 
bark  in  vain.  Servant  Nanak  meditates  on  the  Naam,  O  my  soul;  such  is  the  pre-
ordained destiny which the Lord has written on his forehead.  || 4 || 5 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  
FOURTH MEHL:  All beings are Yours — You permeate them all, O my Lord God; You 
know what they do in their hearts. The Lord is with them, inwardly and outwardly, O 
my soul; He sees everything, but they deny the Lord  in their minds. The Lord is far 
away from the self-willed manmukhs, O my soul; all their efforts are in vain. Servant 
Nanak, as Gurmukh, meditates, O my soul, and comes to behold the Lord ever-present.  
|| 1 ||   They are devotees, and they are selfless servants, O my soul, who are pleasing 
to the Mind of my God. They are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord, O my soul; 
night and day, they remain absorbed in the True One. In their company, one‟s filth is 
washed away, O my soul; attuned to the Lord‟s Love, one comes to bear the Mark of 
His Grace. Nanak prays to God, O my soul; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of 
the Holy, he is satisfied.  || 2 ||   O tongue, chant and meditate on the Lord of the 
Universe;  O  my  soul,  chanting  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har,  your  thirst  shall  be 
quenched. One unto whom my Supreme Lord God shows Mercy, O my soul, enshrines 
the Name in his mind. One who meets the Perfect True Guru, O my soul, obtains the 
treasure of the Lord‟s wealth. By great good fortune, one joins the Sangat, the Holy 
Congregation, O my soul. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 3 ||   In all 
places  and  interspaces,  O  my  soul,  the  Supreme  Lord  God,  the  Great  Giver,  is 
pervading. His limits cannot be found, O my soul; He is the Perfect Architect of Destiny. 
He cherishes all beings, O my soul, as the mother and father cherish their child. By 
thousands  of  clever  tricks,  He  cannot  be  obtained,  O  my  soul;  servant  Nanak,  as 
Gurmukh, has come to know the Lord.  || 4 || 6 ||  First Set of Six  ||    
 
BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT,  FIRST HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
I have seen a miracle of the Lord, O my dear beloveds — whatever He does is righteous 
and just. The Lord has fashioned this beautiful arena, O my dear beloveds, where all 
come and go.
