  628    1 Samuel 4 
6  And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, 
What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the 
Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come 
 
into the camp. 
7  And the Philistines were afraid; for they said, God is come into the 
 
camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a 
 
thing heretofore. 
8  Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty 
 
Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the 
 
plagues in the wilderness. 
9  Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be 
not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit 
 
yourselves like men, and fight. 
10  ¶ And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled 
every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for 
   
there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
11  And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and 
 
Phinehas, were slain. 
12  ¶ And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to 
Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his 
head. 
13  And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: 
 
for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came 
into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. 
14  And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth 
the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. 
 
15  Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that 
 
he could not see. 
16  And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I 
fled today out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my 
son? 
 
17  And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the 
Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the 
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and 
the ark of God is taken.
