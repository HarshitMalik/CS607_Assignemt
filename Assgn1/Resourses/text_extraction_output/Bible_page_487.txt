  488    Deuteronomy 32 
and shall consume the earth with her increase, 
and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
23  I will heap mischiefs upon them; 
 
I will spend mine arrows upon them. 
24  They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, 
and with bitter destruction: 
 
I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, 
with the poison of serpents of the dust. 
25  The sword without, and terror within, 
shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, 
the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. 
26  I said, I would scatter them into corners, 
I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: 
 
27  were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, 
lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, 
and lest they should say, Our hand is high, 
and the Lord hath not done all this. 
28  For they are a nation void of counsel, 
neither is there any understanding in them. 
29  O that they were wise, that they understood this, 
that they would consider their latter end! 
 
30  How should one chase a thousand, 
and two put ten thousand to flight, 
except their Rock had sold them, 
and the Lord had shut them up? 
 
31  For their rock is not as our Rock, 
even our enemies themselves being judges. 
32  For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, 
and of the fields of Gomorrah: 
 
their grapes are grapes of gall, 
their clusters are bitter: 
 
33  their wine is the poison of dragons, 
and the cruel venom of asps. 
34  Is not this laid up in store with me, 
and sealed up among my treasures?
