  160    Exodus 15 
10  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: 
 
they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 
11  Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? 
 
Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, 
fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
 
12  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, 
the earth swallowed them. 
13  Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast 
redeemed: 
 
thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 
14  The people shall hear, and be afraid: 
 
sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
15  Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; 
 
the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; 
 
all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. 
16  Fear and dread shall fall upon them; 
 
by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; 
 
till thy people pass over, O Lord, 
till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. 
17  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine 
inheritance, 
in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; 
 
in the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established. 
18  The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. 
19  Â¶ For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his 
horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of 
the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in 
 
the midst of the sea. 
20  And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in 
her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and 
 
with dances. 
21  And Miriam answered them, 
Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: 
 
the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
