  1473    Ecclesiastes 8 
8 
1  Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a 
 
thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness 
 
of his face shall be changed. 
2  ¶ I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard 
of the oath of God. 
3  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he 
   
doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
4  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto 
 
him, What doest thou? 
 
5  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a 
 
wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment. 
6  Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the 
misery of man is great upon him. 
7  For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when 
 
it shall be? 
 
8  There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; 
 
neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge 
 
in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to 
 
it. 
9  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is 
done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over 
 
another to his own hurt. 
The Inequalities of Life 
10  ¶ And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the 
place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they 
had so done: this is also vanity. 
 
11  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, 
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
12  Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his days be 
prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that 
fear God, which fear before him:
