  886    2 Kings 20 
35  ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went 
out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore 
and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, 
 
behold, they were all dead corpses. 
36  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, 
and dwelt at Nineveh. 
37  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch 
his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with 
the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-
 
haddon his son reigned in his stead.

Hezekiah’s Sickness 
1  In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet 
Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith 
the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. 
 
2  Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, 
saying, 
3  I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before 
thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is 
good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 
4  And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle 
court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 
5  Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith 
the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I 
have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou 
   
shalt go up unto the house of the Lord. 
6  And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee 
 
and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will 
 
defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s 
sake. 
7  And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on 
the boil, and he recovered.
