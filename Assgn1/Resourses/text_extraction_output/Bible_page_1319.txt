  1320    Psalms 89

89 
Godâ€™s Covenant with David 
Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.  
1  I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever: 
 
with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all 
generations. 
2  For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: 
 
thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 
3  I have made a covenant with my chosen, 
I have sworn unto David my servant, 
4  Thy seed will I establish for ever, 
and build up thy throne to all generations.  
Selah. 
5  And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord: 
 
thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 
6  For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? 
 
Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? 
 
7  God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, 
and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. 
8  O Lord God of hosts, 
who is a strong Lord like unto thee? 
 
or to thy faithfulness round about thee? 
 
9  Thou rulest the raging of the sea: 
 
when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. 
10  Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; 
 
thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 
11  The heavens are thine, 
the earth also is thine:
