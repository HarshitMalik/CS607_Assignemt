  691    1 Samuel 30 
Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell 
 
sick. 
14  We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon 
the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and 
 
we burned Ziklag with fire. 
15  And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this 
company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt 
 
neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I 
will bring thee down to this company. 
16  ¶ And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread 
abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, 
because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of 
the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
17  And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of 
the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four 
 
hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. 
18  And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and 
 
David rescued his two wives. 
19  And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, 
neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they 
had taken to them: David recovered all. 
 
20  And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave 
before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil. 
21  ¶ And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint 
that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to 
abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and 
 
to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near 
 
to the people, he saluted them. 
22  Then answered all the wicked men, and men of Belial, of those that 
went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will 
not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to 
every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, 
and depart.
