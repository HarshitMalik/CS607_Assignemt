  2651    Revelation 22 
24  And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of 
it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it. 
 
25  And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be 
 
no night there. 
26  And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.  
27  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, 
neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they 
 
which are written in the Lamb’s book of life. 
22 
1  And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, 
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
2  In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was 
there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded 
her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the 
 
healing of the nations. 
3  And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the 
 
Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 
   
4  and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. 
 
5  And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither 
 
light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall 
   
reign for ever and ever.  
Jesus to Come Soon 
6  ¶ And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the 
 
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his 
servants the things which must shortly be done. 
7  Behold, I come quickly. 
¶ Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this 
book. 
8  ¶ And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had 
heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel 
which showed me these things.
