  263    Leviticus 15 
52  and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with 
the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar 
wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: 
 
53  but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, 
and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 
 
54  Â¶ This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 
55  and for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 
56  and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 
 
57  to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of 
 
leprosy. 
15 
Unclean Discharges from the Body 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any 
man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is 
unclean. 
3  And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run 
 
with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his 
uncleanness. 
4  Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and 
 
every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean. 
5  And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
6  And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue 
shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean 
until the even. 
7  And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash 
his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the 
even. 
8  And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he 
 
shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean 
until the even.
