  2108    Mark 5 
37  And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the 
ship, so that it was now full. 
38  And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and 
 
they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we 
perish? 
 
39  And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, 
be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
40  And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye 
 
have no faith? 
 
41  And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What 
manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? 
 
5 
The Gadarene Demoniac Healed 
1  And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country 
of the Gadarenes. 
2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him 
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
3  who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind 
 
him, no, not with chains: 
 
4  because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and 
the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken 
in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 
 
5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the 
tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 
7  and cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, 
Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that 
 
thou torment me not. 
8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 
9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, 
 
My name is Legion: for we are many.
