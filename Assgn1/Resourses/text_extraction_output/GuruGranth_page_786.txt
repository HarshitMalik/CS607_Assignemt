O  red-robed  woman,  discard  your  red  dress,  and  then, you  shall  come to love your 
Husband Lord. By wearing her red dress, no one has found her Husband Lord; the self-
willed manmukh is burnt to death. Meeting the True Guru, she discards her red dress, 
and eradicates egotism from within. Her mind and body are imbued with the deep red 
color of His Love, and her tongue is imbued, singing His Praises and excellences. She 
becomes His soul-bride forever, with the Word of the Shabad in her mind; she makes 
the Fear of God and the Love of God her ornaments and decorations. O Nanak, by His 
Merciful  Grace,  she  obtains  the  Mansion  of  the  Lord‟s  Presence,  and  keeps  Him 
enshrined in her heart.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  O bride, forsake your red dress, and 
decorate yourself with the crimson color of His Love. Your comings and goings shall be 
forgotten, contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The soul-bride is adorned and 
beautiful;  the  Celestial  Lord,  her  Husband,  abides  in  her  home.  O  Nanak,  the  bride 
ravishes  and  enjoys  Him;  and  He,  the  Ravisher,  ravishes  and  enjoys  her.    ||  2  ||   
PAUREE:  The foolish, self-willed manmukh is engrossed in false attachment to family. 
Practicing egotism and self-conceit, he dies and departs, taking nothing along with him. 
He does not understand that the Messenger of Death is hovering over his head; he is 
deluded by duality. This opportunity will not come into his hands again; the Messenger 
of  Death  will  seize  him.  He  acts  according  to  his  pre-ordained  destiny.    ||  5  ||   
SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  Do not call them „satee‟, who burn themselves along with their 
husbands‟ corpses. O Nanak, they alone are known as „satee‟, who die from the shock 
of separation.  || 1 ||   THIRD MEHL:  They are also known as „satee‟, who abide in 
modesty  and  contentment.  They  serve  their  Lord,  and  rise  in  the  early  hours  to 
contemplate Him.  || 2 ||   THIRD MEHL:   The widows burn themselves in the fire, 
along with their husbands‟ corpses. If they truly knew their husbands, then they suffer 
terrible bodily pain. O Nanak, if they did not truly know their husbands, why should they 
burn  themselves  in  the  fire?  Whether their  husbands are alive or dead, those wives 
remain far away from them.  || 3 ||   PAUREE:  You created pain along with pleasure; O 
Creator, such is the writ You have written. There is no other gift as great as the Name; 
it has no form or sign. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an inexhaustible treasure; it 
abides in the mind of the Gurmukh. In His Mercy, He blesses us with the Naam, and 
then, the writ of pain and pleasure is not written. Those humble servants who serve 
with love, meet the Lord, chanting the Chant of the Lord.  || 6 ||   SHALOK,  SECOND 
MEHL:    They  know  that  they  will  have  to  depart,  so  why  do  they  make  such 
ostentatious displays? Those who do not know that they will have to depart, continue to 
arrange their affairs.  || 1 ||   SECOND MEHL:  He accumulates wealth during the night 
of his life, but in the morning, he must depart. O Nanak, it shall not go along with him, 
and so he regrets.  || 2 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Paying a fine under pressure, does not 
bring either merit or goodness. That alone is a good deed, O Nanak, which is done by 
one‟s own free will.  || 3 ||   SECOND MEHL:  Stubborn-mindedness will not win the 
Lord to one‟s side, no matter how much it is tried. The Lord is won over to your side, by 
offering  Him  your  true  love,  O  servant  Nanak,  and  contemplating  the  Word  of  the 
Shabad.  || 4 ||   PAUREE:  The Creator created the world; He alone understands it. He 
Himself created the Universe, and He  Himself shall destroy it afterwards.
