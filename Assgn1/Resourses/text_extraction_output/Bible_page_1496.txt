  1497    Isaiah 3 
17  And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness 
of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in 
 
that day. 
18  And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 
19  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of 
the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, 
when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 
20  ¶ In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of 
gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles 
and to the bats; 
 
21  to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged 
rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when 
he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 
22  Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is 
 
he to be accounted of?

The Lord’s Judgment on Judah and Jerusalem 
1  For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from 
Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of 
bread, and the whole stay of water, 
2  the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, 
and the prudent, and the ancient, 
3  the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and 
the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 
4  And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over 
them. 
5  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every 
one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against 
 
the ancient, and the base against the honorable. 
6  ¶ When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his 
father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this 
ruin be under thy hand:
