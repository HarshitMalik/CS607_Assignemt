  2402    Romans 7 
18  Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of 
righteousness. 
19  I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your 
flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness 
 
and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members 
 
servants to righteousness unto holiness. 
20  ¶ For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from 
righteousness. 
21  What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now 
ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 
 
22  But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye 
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 
23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life 
 
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

An Analogy from Marriage 
1  Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) 
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 
 
2  For the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her 
husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is 
 
loosed from the law of her husband. 
3  So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another 
man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, 
 
she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be 
 
married to another man. 
4  ¶ Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by 
the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to 
 
him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit 
unto God. 
5  For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by 
the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
