  1771    Ezekiel 11 
11 
Evil Princes Rebuked 
1  Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate 
of the Lord’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the 
 
door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw 
 
Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes 
of the people. 
2  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise 
mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 
 
3  which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, 
   
and we be the flesh. 
4  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
5  ¶ And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, 
Speak; Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: 
     
for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them. 
6  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the 
streets thereof with the slain. 
7  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Your slain whom ye have laid 
 
in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but 
 
I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 
8  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith 
 
the Lord God. 
9  And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into 
the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
10  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; 
   
and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
11  This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in 
the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel: 
   
12  and ye shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in 
 
my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after 
the manners of the heathen that are round about you. 
13  ¶ And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of 
Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud
