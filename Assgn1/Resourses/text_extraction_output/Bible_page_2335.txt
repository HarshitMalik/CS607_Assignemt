another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any 
 
man common or unclean. 
29  Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent 
for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? 
   
30  ¶ And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; 
 
and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man 
stood before me in bright clothing, 
31  and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in 
remembrance in the sight of God. 
32  Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is 
Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea 
 
side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. 
 
33  Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that 
 
thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, 
to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. 
Peter’s Address in Cornelius’ House 
34  ¶ Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that 
God is no respecter of persons:  
 
35  but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh

36  The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching 
peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) 
   
37  that word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all 
Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John

oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
 
39  And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of 
the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: 
   
40  him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly; 
 
41  not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even 
to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
