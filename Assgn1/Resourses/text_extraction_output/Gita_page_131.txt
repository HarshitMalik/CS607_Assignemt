THE YOGA OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT
16. Two Purushas there are in this world, the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are
the perishable, and the Kutastha is called the imperishable.
Uttamah purushastwanyah paramaatmetyudaahritah;
Yo lokatrayamaavishya bibhartyavyaya ishwarah.
17. But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord who,
pervading the three worlds, sustains them.
Yasmaat ksharam ateeto’hamaksharaadapi chottamah;
Ato’smi loke vede cha prathitah purushottamah.
18. As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared as
the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.
Yo maamevam asammoodho jaanaati purushottamam;
Sa sarvavidbhajati maam sarvabhaavena bhaarata.
19. He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships
Me with his whole being (heart), O Arjuna!
Iti guhyatamam shaastram idamuktam mayaa’nagha;
Etadbuddhwaa buddhimaan syaat kritakrityashcha bhaarata.
20. Thus, this most secret science has been taught by Me, O sinless one! On knowing this, a
man becomes wise, and all his duties are accomplished, O Arjuna!
Hari Om Tat Sat
Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam
Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fifteenth discourse
entitled:
“The Yoga of the Supreme Spirit”
