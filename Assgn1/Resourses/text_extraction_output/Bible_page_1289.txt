  1290    Psalms 69 
that was to my reproach. 
11  I made sackcloth also my garment; 
 
and I became a proverb to them. 
12  They that sit in the gate speak against me; 
 
and I was the song of the drunkards. 
13  But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, 
in an acceptable time: 
 
O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, 
in the truth of thy salvation. 
14  Deliver me out of the mire, 
and let me not sink: 
 
let me be delivered from them that hate me, 
and out of the deep waters. 
15  Let not the waterflood overflow me, 
neither let the deep swallow me up, 
and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 
16  Hear me, O Lord; 
 
for thy loving-kindness is good: 
 
turn unto me 
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 
17  And hide not thy face from thy servant; 
 
for I am in trouble: 
 
hear me speedily. 
18  Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: 
 
deliver me because of mine enemies. 
19  Thou hast known my reproach, 
and my shame, and my dishonor: 
 
mine adversaries are all before thee. 
20  Reproach hath broken my heart; 
 
and I am full of heaviness: 
 
and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; 
 
and for comforters, but I found none. 
21  They gave me also gall for my meat; 
 
and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.  
22  Let their table become a snare before them:
