  2305    John 21 
13  Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish 
likewise. 
14  This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his 
disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
Feed My Sheep 
15  ¶ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of 
Jona, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, 
 
Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my 
 
lambs. 
16  He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jona, lovest 
thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love 
   
thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 
17  He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jona, lovest thou 
me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, 
 
Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all 
 
things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed 
 
my sheep. 
18  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou 
girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when 
 
thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another 
shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 
19  This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And 
when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. 
The Beloved Disciple 
20  ¶ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved 
following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, 
 
Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  
 
21  Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
 
22  Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to 
thee? follow thou me.
