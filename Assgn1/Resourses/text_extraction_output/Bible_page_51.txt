  52    Genesis 24 
12  And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send 
me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master 
Abraham. 
13  Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the 
 
men of the city come out to draw water: 
 
14  and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let 
down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, 
 
Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that 
 
thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know 
 
that thou hast showed kindness unto my master. 
15  ¶ And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, 
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the 
wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her 
shoulder. 
16  And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had 
any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her 
 
pitcher, and came up. 
17  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, 
drink a little water of thy pitcher. 
18  And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her 
 
pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
19  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw 
water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
20  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran 
again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 
21  And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the 
Lord had made his journey prosperous or not. 
22  ¶ And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the 
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two 
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
 
23  and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there 
   
room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in? 
 
24  And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of 
Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
