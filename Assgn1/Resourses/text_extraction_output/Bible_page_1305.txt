  1306    Psalms 78 
32  For all this they sinned still, 
and believed not for his wondrous works. 
33  Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, 
and their years in trouble. 
34  When he slew them, then they sought him: 
 
and they returned and inquired early after God. 
35  And they remembered that God was their rock, 
and the high God their redeemer. 
36  Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, 
and they lied unto him with their tongues. 
37  For their heart was not right with him,  
neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
38  But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, 
and destroyed them not: 
 
yea, many a time turned he his anger away, 
and did not stir up all his wrath. 
39  For he remembered that they were but flesh; 
 
a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
40  How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, 
and grieve him in the desert! 
 
41  Yea, they turned back and tempted God, 
and limited the Holy One of Israel. 
42  They remembered not his hand, 
nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy: 
 
43  how he had wrought his signs in Egypt, 
and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
 
44  and had turned their rivers into blood; 
 
and their floods, that they could not drink.  
45  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; 
 
and frogs, which destroyed them. 
46  He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, 
and their labor unto the locust.  
47  He destroyed their vines with hail, 
and their sycamore trees with frost. 
48  He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
