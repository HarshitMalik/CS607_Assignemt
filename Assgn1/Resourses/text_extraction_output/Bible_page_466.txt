  467    Deuteronomy 25 
husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in 
Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother. 
8  Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if 
 
he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

18  how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even 
all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; 
 
and he feared not God. 
19  Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest
