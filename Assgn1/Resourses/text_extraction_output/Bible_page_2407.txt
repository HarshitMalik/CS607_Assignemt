  2408    Romans 9 
11  (for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good 
or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, 
not of works, but of him that calleth;) 
 
12  it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  
13  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  
14  ¶ What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God 
   
forbid. 
15  For he saith to Moses, 
I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, 
and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  
16  So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of 
God that showeth mercy. 
17  For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, 
Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, 
that I might show my power in thee, 
and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  
18  Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom 
he will he hardeneth. 
19  ¶ Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who 
 
hath resisted his will? 
 
20  Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the 
 
thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me 
thus?  
 
21  Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make 
one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? 
 
22  What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power 
known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath 
fitted to destruction: 
 
23  and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the 
vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 
24  even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the 
Gentiles? 
 
25  As he saith also in Hosea, 
I will call them my people, 
which were not my people;
