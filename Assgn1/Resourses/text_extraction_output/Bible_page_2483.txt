  2484    Galatians 4 
18  But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not 
only when I am present with you. 
19  My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be 
formed in you, 
20  I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I 
 
stand in doubt of you. 
The Allegory of Hagar and Sarah 
21  Â¶ Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the 
law? 
 
22  For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a 
bondmaid, the other by a free woman.  
23  But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he 
 
of the free woman was by promise. 
24  Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the 
   
one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is 
Hagar. 
25  For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to 
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
26  But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. 
27  For it is written, 
Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; 
 
break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: 
 
for the desolate hath many more children 
than she which hath a husband.  
28  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. 
29  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was 
born after the Spirit, even so it is now. 
30  Nevertheless what saith the Scripture? 
 
Cast out the bondwoman and her son: 
 
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir 
with the son of the free woman.  
31  So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of 
the free.
