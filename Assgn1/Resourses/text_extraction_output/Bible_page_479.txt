  480    Deuteronomy 30 
are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot 
out his name from under heaven. 
21  And the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of 
Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in 
this book of the law: 
 
22  so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up 
after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, 
when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which 
the Lord hath laid upon it; 
 
23  and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, 
that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like 
the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, 
which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
 
24  even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus 
unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? 
   
25  Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them when he 
brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: 
 
26  for they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods 
whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them: 
 
27  and the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring 
upon it all the curses that are written in this book: 
 
28  and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, 
and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is 
this day. 
29  Â¶ The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things 
 
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that 
we may do all the words of this law.

1  And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon 
thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and
