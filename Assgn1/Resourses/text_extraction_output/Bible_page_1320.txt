  1321    Psalms 89 
as for the world and the fulness thereof, 
thou hast founded them. 
12  The north and the south thou hast created them: 
 
Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. 
13  Thou hast a mighty arm: 
 
strong is thy hand, 
and high is thy right hand. 
14  Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: 
 
mercy and truth shall go before thy face. 
15  Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: 
 
they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. 
16  In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: 
 
and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. 
17  For thou art the glory of their strength: 
 
and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted. 
18  For the Lord is our defense; 
 
and the Holy One of Israel is our King. 
19  Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, 
I have laid help upon one that is mighty; 
 
I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 
20  I have found David my servant;  
 
with my holy oil have I anointed him:  
 
21  with whom my hand shall be established: 
 
mine arm also shall strengthen him. 
22  The enemy shall not exact upon him; 
 
nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 
23  And I will beat down his foes before his face, 
and plague them that hate him. 
24  But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: 
 
and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 
25  I will set his hand also in the sea, 
and his right hand in the rivers. 
26  He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, 
my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
27  Also I will make him my firstborn,
