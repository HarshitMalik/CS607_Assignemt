  395    Numbers 33 
32  We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, 
that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be 
ours.  
33  ¶ And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to 
the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the 
son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the 
kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in 
the coasts, even the cities of the country round about. 
34  And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
35  and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 
36  and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities; and folds for 
 
sheep. 
37  And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and 
Kirjathaim, 
38  and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and 
Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 
 
39  And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, 
and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it. 
40  And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he 
 
dwelt therein. 
41  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns 
thereof, and called them Havoth-jair. 
42  And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and 
called it Nobah, after his own name.

The Stages of Israel’s Journey 
1  These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth 
out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses 
and Aaron. 
2  And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by 
the commandment of the Lord: and these are their journeys 
 
according to their goings out.
