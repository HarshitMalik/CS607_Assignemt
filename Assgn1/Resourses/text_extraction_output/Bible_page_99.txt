  100    Genesis 41 
31  and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that 
famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 
 
32  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is 
 
because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring 
it to pass. 
33  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and 
set him over the land of Egypt. 
34  Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and 
take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous 
years. 
35  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and 
lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in 
the cities. 
36  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years 
of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish 
 
not through the famine. 
Joseph Made Ruler over Egypt 
37  ¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of 
all his servants. 
38  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this 
is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 
 
39  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed 
thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 
 
40  thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all 
my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
 
41  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land 
of Egypt. 
42  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon 
Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a 
gold chain about his neck; 
 
43  and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and 
 
they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over 
 
all the land of Egypt.
