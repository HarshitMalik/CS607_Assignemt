  1939    Amos 7 
7 
Three Visions of Destruction 
1  Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me; and, behold, he formed 
 
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter 
growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings. 
 
2  And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the 
grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: 
 
by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small. 
 
3  The Lord repented for this: It shall not be, saith the Lord. 
 
4  ¶ Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: and, behold, the Lord 
 
God called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and 
did eat up a part. 
5  Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall 
 
Jacob arise? for he is small. 
 
6  The Lord repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord 
 
God. 
7  ¶ Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall 
 
made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 
8  And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A 
 
plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in 
the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any 
 
more: 
 
9  and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of 
Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of 
 
Jeroboam with the sword. 
Amos and Amaziah 
10  ¶ Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of 
Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the 
house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 
 
11  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel 
shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
