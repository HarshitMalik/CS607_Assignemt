  2021    Matthew 5 
Jesus’ Attitude toward Adultery 
27  ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not 
commit adultery:  
 
28  but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust 
after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 
29  And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: 
 
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, 
and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  
30  And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: 
 
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, 
and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  
Jesus’ Attitude toward Divorce 
31  ¶ It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give 
her a writing of divorcement:  
 
32  but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving 
for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and 
 
whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.  
Jesus’ Attitude toward Oaths 
33  ¶ Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, 
Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord 
thine oaths:  
 
34  but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is 
   
God’s throne:  
 
35  nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it 
     
is the city of the great King.  
36  Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make 
one hair white or black. 
37  But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever 
   
is more than these cometh of evil.
