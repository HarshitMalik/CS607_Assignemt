  2020    Matthew 5 
Jesus’ Attitude toward the Law 
17  ¶ Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I 
 
am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
18  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one 
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  
19  Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least 
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least 
in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, 
 
the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
20  For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the 
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. 
Jesus’ Attitude toward Anger 
21  ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not 
kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: 
   
22  but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother 
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever 
 
shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but 
 
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. 
23  Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest 
that thy brother hath aught against thee; 
 
24  leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be 
 
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 
25  Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with 
him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and 
 
the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 
26  Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till 
thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
