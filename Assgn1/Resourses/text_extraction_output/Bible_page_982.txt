  983    2 Chronicles 6 
13  for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and 
five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst 
of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his 
 
knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his 
hands toward heaven, 
14  and said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the 
heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and showest 
 
mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: 
 
15  thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which 
thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast 
 
fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
16  Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David 
my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall 
not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet 
 
so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as 
thou hast walked before me.  
17  Now then, O Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which 
thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. 
18  ¶ But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, 
 
heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much 
 
less this house which I have built!  
 
19  Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his 
supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the 
prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee: 
 
20  that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon 
the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name 
there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth 
 
toward this place. 
21  Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy 
people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou 
 
from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, 
 
forgive. 
22  ¶ If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to 
make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this 
house;
