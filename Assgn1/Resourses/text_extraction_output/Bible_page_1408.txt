  1409    Proverbs 5 
15  Avoid it, pass not by it, 
turn from it, and pass away. 
16  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; 
 
and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. 
17  For they eat the bread of wickedness, 
and drink the wine of violence. 
18  But the path of the just is as the shining light, 
that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 
19  The way of the wicked is as darkness: 
 
they know not at what they stumble. 
20  My son, attend to my words; 
 
incline thine ear unto my sayings. 
21  Let them not depart from thine eyes; 
 
keep them in the midst of thine heart. 
22  For they are life unto those that find them, 
and health to all their flesh. 
23  Keep thy heart with all diligence; 
 
for out of it are the issues of life. 
24  Put away from thee a froward mouth, 
and perverse lips put far from thee. 
25  Let thine eyes look right on, 
and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. 
26  Ponder the path of thy feet,  
and let all thy ways be established. 
27  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: 
 
remove thy foot from evil.
