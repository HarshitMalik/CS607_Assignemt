  1970    Habakkuk 3 
15  ¶ Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest thy 
bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look 
on their nakedness! 
 
16  Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy 
 
foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the Lord’s right hand shall be 
 
turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory. 
17  For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of 
beasts, which made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the 
violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. 
18  ¶ What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath 
graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of 
 
his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? 
 
19  Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, 
 
Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and 
 
there is no breath at all in the midst of it. 
20  ¶ But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence 
 
before him.

Habakkuk’s Prayer 
1  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. 
2  O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: 
 
O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, 
in the midst of the years make known; 
 
in wrath remember mercy. 
3  God came from Teman, 
and the Holy One from mount Paran. 
Selah. 
His glory covered the heavens, 
and the earth was full of his praise. 
4  And his brightness was as the light; 
 
he had horns coming out of his hand: 
 
and there was the hiding of his power.
