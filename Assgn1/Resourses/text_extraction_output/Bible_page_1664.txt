  1665    Jeremiah 25 
2  the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, 
and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
3  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, 
even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of 
the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising 
early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. 
 
4  And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, 
rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor 
 
inclined your ear to hear. 
5  They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and 
from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the Lord 
hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 
 
6  and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, 
and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I 
 
will do you no hurt. 
7  Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord; that ye might 
 
provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own 
hurt. 
8  Â¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not 
 
heard my words, 
9  behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the 
Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and 
will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants 
thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly 
destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and 
perpetual desolations. 
10  Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of 
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, 
the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.  
11  And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; 
 
and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.  
12  And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, 
that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the 
Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will 
make it perpetual desolations.
