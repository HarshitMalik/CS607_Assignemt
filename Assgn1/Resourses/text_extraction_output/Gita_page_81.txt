THE YOGA OF WISDOM AND REALISATION
Antavattu phalam teshaam tadbhavatyalpamedhasaam;
Devaan devayajo yaanti madbhaktaa yaanti maamapi.
23. Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The
worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.
Avyaktam vyaktimaapannam manyante maamabuddhayah;
Param bhaavamajaananto mamaavyayamanuttamam.
24. The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My
higher, immutable and most excellent nature.
Naaham prakaashah sarvasya yogamaayaasamaavritah;
Moodho’yam naabhijaanaati loko maamajamavyayam.
25. I am not manifest to all (as I am), being veiled by the Yoga Maya. This deluded world
does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.
Vedaaham samateetaani vartamaanaani chaarjuna;
Bhavishyaani cha bhootani maam tu veda na kashchana.
26. I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows
Me.
Icchaadweshasamutthena dwandwamohena bhaarata;
Sarvabhootaani sammoham sarge yaanti parantapa.
27. By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all
beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa!
Yeshaam twantagatam paapam janaanaam punyakarmanaam;
Te dwandwamohanirmuktaa bhajante maam dridhavrataah.
28. But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed
from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.
Jaraamaranamokshaaya maamaashritya yatanti ye;
Te brahma tadviduh kritsnam adhyaatmam karma chaakhilam.
29. Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in
full that Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action.
Saadhibhootaadhidaivam maam saadhiyajnam cha ye viduh;
Prayaanakaale’pi cha maam te vidur yuktachetasah.
