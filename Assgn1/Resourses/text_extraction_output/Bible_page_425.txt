  426    Deuteronomy 7 
5  But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and 
 
break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their 
graven images with fire.  
A Holy People to the Lord 
6  ¶ For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy 
 
God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all 
people that are upon the face of the earth. 
7  The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because 
ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of 
 
all people: 
 
8  but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the 
oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord 
brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the 
house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
9  Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful 
God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him 
and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; 
 
10  and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he 
 
will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his 
face. 
11  Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, 
and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. 
The Blessings of Obedience 
12  ¶ Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, 
and keep and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee 
the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 
 
13  and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also 
 
bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and 
thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of 
thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
