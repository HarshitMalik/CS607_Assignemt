  2177    Luke 7 
33  For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; 
 
and ye say, He hath a devil. 
34  The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a 
 
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and 
sinners! 
 
35  But wisdom is justified of all her children. 
Jesus at the Home of Simon the Pharisee 
36  ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. 
And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. 
37  And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she 
knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an 
alabaster box of ointment, 
38  and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his 
feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and 
kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  
39  Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake 
within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have 
known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; 
 
for she is a sinner. 
40  And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say 
unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
41  There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed 
 
five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
42  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. 
Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 
 
43  Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave 
most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
44  And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this 
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for 
 
my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them 
 
with the hairs of her head. 
45  Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, 
 
hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
