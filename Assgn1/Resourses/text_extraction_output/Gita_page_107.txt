THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
29. As moths hurriedly rush into a blazing fire for (their own) destruction, so also these
creatures hurriedly rush into Thy mouths for (their own) destruction.
Lelihyase grasamaanah samantaal
Lokaan samagraan vadanair jwaladbhih;
Tejobhiraapoorya jagatsamagram
Bhaasastavograah pratapanti vishno.
30. Thou lickest up, devouring all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths. Thy
fierce rays, filling the whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu!
Aakhyaahi me ko bhavaanugraroopo
Namo’stu te devavara praseeda;
Vijnaatumicchaami bhavantamaadyam
Na hi prajaanaami tava pravrittim.
31. Tell me, who Thou art, so fierce in form. Salutations to Thee, O God Supreme! Have
mercy; I desire to know Thee, the original Being. I know not indeed Thy doing.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Kaalo’smi lokakshayakrit pravriddho
Lokaan samaahartumiha pravrittah;
Rite’pi twaam na bhavishyanti sarve
Ye’wasthitaah pratyaneekeshu yodhaah.
The Blessed Lord said:
32. I am the mighty world-destroying Time, now engaged in destroying the worlds. Even
without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies shall live.
Tasmaat twam uttishtha yasho labhaswa
Jitwaa shatroon bhungkshwa raajyam samriddham;
Mayaivaite nihataah poorvameva
Nimittamaatram bhava savyasaachin.
33. Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Conquer the enemies and enjoy the unrivalled
kingdom. Verily, they have already been slain by Me; be thou a mere instrument, O Arjuna!
Dronam cha bheeshmam cha jayadratham cha
Karnam tathaa’nyaanapi yodhaveeraan;
Mayaa hataamstwam jahi maa vyathishthaa
Yudhyaswa jetaasi rane sapatnaan.
34. Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna and all the other courageous warriors—these have
already been slain by Me; do thou kill; be not distressed with fear; fight and thou shalt conquer thy
enemies in battle.
