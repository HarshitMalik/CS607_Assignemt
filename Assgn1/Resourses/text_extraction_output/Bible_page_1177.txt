  1178    Job 31 
27  My bowels boiled, and rested not: 
 
the days of affliction prevented me. 
28  I went mourning without the sun: 
 
I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. 
29  I am a brother to dragons, 
and a companion to owls. 
30  My skin is black upon me, 
and my bones are burned with heat. 
31  My harp also is turned to mourning, 
and my organ into the voice of them that weep.

Job Asserts His Integrity 
1  I made a covenant with mine eyes;

and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
 
3  Is not destruction to the wicked? 
 
and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 
 
4  Doth not he see my ways, 
and count all my steps? 
 
5  If I have walked with vanity, 
or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
 
6  let me be weighed in an even balance, 
that God may know mine integrity. 
7  If my step hath turned out of the way, 
and mine heart walked after mine eyes, 
and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
 
8  then let me sow, and let another eat; 
 
yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 
9  If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, 
or if I have laid wait at my neighborâ€™s door; 
 
10  then let my wife grind unto another,
