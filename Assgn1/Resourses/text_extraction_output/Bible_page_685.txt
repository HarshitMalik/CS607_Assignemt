  686    1 Samuel 28 
28 
1  And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their 
armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said 
unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to 
battle, thou and thy men. 
2  And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant 
can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee 
keeper of mine head for ever. 
Saul and the Medium at En-dor 
3  ¶ Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and 
buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away 
those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
4  And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and 
pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they 
 
pitched in Gilboa. 
5  And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and 
his heart greatly trembled. 
6  And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him 
not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 
7  Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a 
familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his 
servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar 
spirit at En-dor. 
8  ¶ And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he 
went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by 
night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar 
 
spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. 
9  And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul 
hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and 
the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for 
 
my life, to cause me to die?
