  112    Genesis 46 
23  And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the 
 
good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread 
and meat for his father by the way. 
24  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto 
 
them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 
25  And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan 
unto Jacob their father, 
26  and told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all 
the land of Egypt. And Jacobâ€™s heart fainted, for he believed them 
not. 
27  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto 
them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry 
 
him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 
28  And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and 
   
see him before I die.

Jacob and His Family in Egypt 
1  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-
sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 
2  And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, 
Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 
3  And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down 
 
into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. 
 
4  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring 
 
thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 
 
5  And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried 
 
Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the 
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
6  And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten 
in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed 
with him:
