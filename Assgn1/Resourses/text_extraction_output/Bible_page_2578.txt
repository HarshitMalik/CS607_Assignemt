  2579    James 3 
3 
The Tongue 
1  My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive 
the greater condemnation. 
2  For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, 
the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. 
3  Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; 
 
and we turn about their whole body. 
4  Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven 
of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, 
whithersoever the governor listeth. 
5  Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. 
Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! 
 
6  ¶ And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue 
 
among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on 
fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 
 
7  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things 
in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 
 
8  but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly 
 
poison. 
9  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we 
 
men, which are made after the similitude of God.  
10  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My 
brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
11  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and 
bitter? 
 
12  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? 
   
so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
