  1307    Psalms 78 
and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  
49  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, 
wrath, and indignation, and trouble, 
by sending evil angels among them. 
50  He made a way to his anger; 
 
he spared not their soul from death, 
but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
 
51  and smote all the firstborn in Egypt;  
 
the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
 
52  but made his own people to go forth like sheep, 
and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  
53  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: 
 
but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  
54  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,  
even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 
55  He cast out the heathen also before them,  
and divided them an inheritance by line, 
and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
56  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God,  
and kept not his testimonies: 
 
57  but turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: 
 
they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
58  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, 
and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
59  When God heard this, he was wroth, 
and greatly abhorred Israel: 
 
60  so that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, 
the tent which he placed among men;  
 
61  and delivered his strength into captivity, 
and his glory into the enemyâ€™s hand.  
62  He gave his people over also unto the sword; 
 
and was wroth with his inheritance. 
63  The fire consumed their young men; 
 
and their maidens were not given to marriage. 
64  Their priests fell by the sword;
