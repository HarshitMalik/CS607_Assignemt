The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Philippians 
[Philippians] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, 
¶ To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the 
bishops and deacons: 
 
2  ¶ Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and from the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 
Paul’s Prayer for the Philippian Christians 
3  ¶ I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
4  always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 
5  for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
 
6  being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good 
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 
 
7  even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you 
in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and 
 
confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 
8  For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels 
of Jesus Christ. 
9  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in 
knowledge and in all judgment; 
 
10  that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be 
 
sincere and without offense till the day of Christ; 
 
11  being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus 
Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
