BHAGAVAD GITA
Vyaamishreneva vaakyena buddhim mohayaseeva me;
Tadekam vada nishchitya yena shreyo’ham aapnuyaam.
2. With these apparently perplexing words Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding;
therefore, tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Loke’smin dwividhaa nishthaa puraa proktaa mayaanagha;
Jnaanayogena saankhyaanaam karmayogena yoginaam.
The Blessed Lord said:
3. In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one,—the path of
knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogis!
Na karmanaam anaarambhaan naishkarmyam purusho’shnute;
Na cha sannyasanaad eva siddhim samadhigacchati.
4. Not by the non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness, nor by mere
renunciation does he attain to perfection.
COMMENTARY: Even if a man abandons action, his mind may be active. One cannot
reach perfection or freedom from action or knowledge of the Self, merely by renouncing action. He
must possess knowledge of the Self.
Na hi kashchit kshanamapi jaatu tishthatyakarmakrit;
Kaaryate hyavashah karma sarvah prakritijair gunaih.
5. Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for, everyone
is made to act helplessly indeed by the qualities born of Nature.
COMMENTARY: The ignorant man is driven to action helplessly by the actions of the
Gunas—Rajas, Tamas and Sattwa.
Karmendriyaani samyamya ya aaste manasaa smaran;
Indriyaarthaan vimoodhaatmaa mithyaachaarah sa uchyate.
6. He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he, of
deluded understanding, is called a hypocrite.
Yastwindriyaani manasaa niyamyaarabhate’rjuna;
Karmendriyaih karmayogam asaktah sa vishishyate.
7. But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma
Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels!
