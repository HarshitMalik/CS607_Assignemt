  1246    Psalms 37 
6  And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, 
and thy judgment as the noonday. 
7  Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: 
 
fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, 
because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 
8  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: 
 
fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. 
9  For evildoers shall be cut off: 
 
but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. 
10  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: 
 
yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. 
11  But the meek shall inherit the earth;  
 
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 
12  The wicked plotteth against the just, 
and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 
13  The Lord shall laugh at him: 
 
for he seeth that his day is coming. 
14  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, 
to cast down the poor and needy, 
and to slay such as be of upright conversation. 
15  Their sword shall enter into their own heart, 
and their bows shall be broken. 
16  A little that a righteous man hath 
is better than the riches of many wicked. 
17  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: 
 
but the Lord upholdeth the righteous. 
18  The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: 
 
and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
19  They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: 
 
and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 
20  But the wicked shall perish, 
and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: 
 
they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. 
 
21  The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: 
 
but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.
