  598    Judges 18 
4  Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took 
 
two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who 
made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in 
 
the house of Micah. 
5  And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and 
teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
6  In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that 
which was right in his own eyes.  
7  Â¶ And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the 
family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
8  And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah to 
sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount 
 
Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. 
9  And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto 
 
him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I 
may find a place. 
10  And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father 
and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and 
a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. 
11  And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young 
 
man was unto him as one of his sons. 
12  And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his 
 
priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
13  Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, 
seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

Micah and the Danites 
1  In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe 
 
of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto 
 
that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the 
tribes of Israel.
