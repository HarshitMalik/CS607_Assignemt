  1950    Jonah 4 
5  So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and 
put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of 
them.  
6  ¶ For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his 
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with 
sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
7  And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh 
by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man 
nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor 
 
drink water: 
 
8  but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily 
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from 
 
the violence that is in their hands. 
9  Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his 
fierce anger, that we perish not? 
 
10  ¶ And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; 
 
and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do 
unto them; and he did it not.

Jonah’s Displeasure 
1  But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. 
2  And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was 
not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled 
 
before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and 
 
merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of 
the evil. 
3  Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for 
 
it is better for me to die than to live. 
4  Then said the Lord, Doest thou well to be angry? 
 
5  So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, 
and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he 
might see what would become of the city.
