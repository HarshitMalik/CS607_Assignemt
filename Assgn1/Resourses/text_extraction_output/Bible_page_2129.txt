  2130    Mark 11 
3  And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord 
 
hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. 
 
4  And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door 
without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. 
 
5  And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, 
loosing the colt? 
 
6  And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they 
 
let them go. 
7  And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; 
 
and he sat upon him. 
8  And many spread their garments in the way; and others cut down 
 
branches off the trees, and strewed them in the way. 
9  And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, 
Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:  
   
10  Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, 
that cometh in the name of the Lord: 
 
Hosanna in the highest. 
11  ¶ And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when 
 
he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide 
was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. 
The Cursing of the Fig Tree 
12  ¶ And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was 
hungry: 
 
13  and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he 
might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found 
 
nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. 
 
14  And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee 
hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it. 
The Cleansing of the Temple 
15  ¶ And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and 
 
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
