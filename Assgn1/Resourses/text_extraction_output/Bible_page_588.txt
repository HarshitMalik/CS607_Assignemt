  589    Judges 13 
10  And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, 
and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that 
came unto me the other day. 
11  And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, 
and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? 
 
And he said, I am. 
12  And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we 
order the child, and how shall we do unto him? 
 
13  And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said 
unto the woman let her beware. 
14  She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her 
drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I 
 
commanded her let her observe. 
15  ¶ And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, I pray thee, let us 
detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. 
16  And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain 
me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt 
 
offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord. For Manoah knew not 
that he was an angel of the Lord. 
17  And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, 
that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honor? 
 
18  And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou thus 
after my name, seeing it is secret? 
 
19  So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a 
rock unto the Lord: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah 
   
and his wife looked on. 
20  For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from 
off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of 
the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their 
 
faces to the ground. 
21  ¶ But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to 
his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord. 
22  And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we 
have seen God.
