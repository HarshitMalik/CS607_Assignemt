  771    1 Kings 4 
19  Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of 
Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was 
 
the only officer which was in the land. 
20  ¶ Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in 
multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
21  And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the 
land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought 
 
presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
22  ¶ And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine 
flour, and threescore measures of meal, 
23  ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred 
sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. 
24  For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from 
Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and 
 
he had peace on all sides round about him. 
25  And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and 
under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of 
Solomon. 
26  And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, 
and twelve thousand horsemen.  
27  And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all 
that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they 
 
lacked nothing. 
28  Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they 
unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his 
charge. 
29  ¶ And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding 
much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the 
seashore. 
30  And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of 
the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
31  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and 
 
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame 
 
was in all nations round about.
