both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the 
seventh day. 
20  And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all 
work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood. 
The Division of the Booty 
21  ¶ And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to 
the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord 
commanded Moses; 
 
22  only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the 
lead, 
23  every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the 
fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the 
 
water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make 
 
go through the water. 
24  And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be 
clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. 
25  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
26  Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, 
thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the 
congregation: 
 
27  and divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war 
 
upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the 
congregation. 
28  And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went 
out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of 
 
the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 
 
29  take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for a heave 
offering of the Lord. 
30  And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of 
fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of 
all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep 
the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.
