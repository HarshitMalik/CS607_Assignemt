10  For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially 
they of the circumcision: 
 
11  whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, 
teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucreâ€™s sake.

be sound in the faith; 
 
14  not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that 
turn from the truth.

and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and 
 
conscience is defiled. 
16  They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, 
 
being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work 
reprobate.

good things; 
 
4  that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their 
husbands, to love their children, 
5  to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own 
husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
6  Young men likewise exhort to be soberminded. 
7  In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine 
 
showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
