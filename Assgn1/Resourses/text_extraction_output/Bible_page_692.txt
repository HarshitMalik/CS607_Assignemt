  693    1 Samuel 31 
4  Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust 
me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust 
 
me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he 
 
was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
5  And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise 
upon his sword, and died with him. 
6  So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his 
men, that same day together. 
7  And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the 
valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men 
of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook 
the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
 
8  Â¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to 
strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in 
mount Gilboa. 
9  And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into 
the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of 
their idols, and among the people. 
10  And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they 
 
fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
11  And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the 
Philistines had done to Saul, 
12  all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of 
Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and 
came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
13  And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, 
and fasted seven days.
