  2566    Hebrews 10 
22  let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having 
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies 
washed with pure water.  
23  Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for he 
 
is faithful that promised; 
 
24  and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good 
works: 
 
25  not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner 
of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye 
   
see the day approaching. 
26  ¶ For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of 
the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
27  but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, 
which shall devour the adversaries.  
28  He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or 
three witnesses:  
 
29  of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought 
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath 
counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an 
unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
 
30  For we know him that hath said, 
Vengeance belongeth unto me, 
I will recompense, saith the Lord.  
And again, 
The Lord shall judge his people.  
31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
32  ¶ But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were 
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 
 
33  partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and 
afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that 
 
were so used. 
34  For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the 
spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in 
heaven a better and an enduring substance.
