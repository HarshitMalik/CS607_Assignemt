  2253    John 5 
47  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he 
went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and 
heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
 
48  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will 
not believe. 
49  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
50  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man 
 
believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his 
way. 
51  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told 
him, saying, Thy son liveth. 
52  Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And 
they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left 
him. 
53  So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus 
said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole 
 
house. 
54  This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come 
out of Judea into Galilee.

The Healing at the Pool 
1  After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to 
 
Jerusalem. 
2  Â¶ Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is 
called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
3  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, 
withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
4  For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and 
troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the 
 
water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
5  And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and 
eight years.
