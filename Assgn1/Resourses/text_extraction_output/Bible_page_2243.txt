  2244    John 1 
30  This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is 
preferred before me; for he was before me. 
 
31  And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, 
 
therefore am I come baptizing with water. 
32  And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from 
heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 
33  And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the 
 
same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit 
descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth 
with the Holy Ghost. 
34  And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. 
The First Disciples 
35  ¶ Again the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples; 
 
36  and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of 
God! 
 
37  And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
38  Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, 
What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being 
 
interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? 
 
39  He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he 
dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth 
 
hour. 
40  One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was 
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 
41  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We 
have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ 
[the anointed]. 
42  And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, 
Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which 
 
is by interpretation, A stone [or, Peter].
