  1516    Isaiah 14 
19  And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ 
excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.  
20  It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from 
generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent 
 
there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 
 
21  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall 
 
be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs 
 
shall dance there. 
22  And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, 
and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, 
 
and her days shall not be prolonged.

The Proverb against the King of Babylon 
1  For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, 
and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined 
 
with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 
2  And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and 
 
the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for 
servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose 
 
captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. 
 
3  ¶ And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee 
rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage 
wherein thou wast made to serve, 
4  that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, 
and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 
   
5  The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of 
the rulers. 
6  He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that 
ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. 
7  The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into 
 
singing.
