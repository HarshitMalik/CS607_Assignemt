  752    2 Samuel 23 
He that ruleth over men must be just, 
ruling in the fear of God. 
4  And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, 
even a morning without clouds; 
 
as the tender grass springing out of the earth 
by clear shining after rain. 
5  Although my house be not so with God; 
 
yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, 
ordered in all things, and sure: 
 
for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, 
although he make it not to grow. 
6  But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, 
because they cannot be taken with hands: 
 
7  but the man that shall touch them 
must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; 
 
and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place. 
David’s Mighty Men 
8  ¶ These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The 
 
Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same 
 
was Adino the Eznite: he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, 
 
whom he slew at one time. 
9  ¶ And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the 
three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that 
were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were 
gone away: 
 
10  he arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and 
his hand clave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a great 
 
victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. 
 
11  ¶ And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And 
the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a 
piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the 
 
Philistines.
