BHAGAVAD GITA
18. Those who are seated in Sattwa proceed upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and
the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards.
Naanyam gunebhyah kartaaram yadaa drashtaanupashyati;
Gunebhyashcha param vetti madbhaavam so’dhigacchati.
19. When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas, knowing that which is higher than
them, he attains to My Being.
COMMENTARY: The seer knows that the Gunas alone are responsible for all actions and
He is distinct from them.
Gunaanetaanateetya treen dehee dehasamudbhavaan;
Janmamrityujaraaduhkhair vimukto’mritamashnute.
20. The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is
evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to immortality.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Kairlingais treen gunaanetaan ateeto bhavati prabho;
Kimaachaarah katham chaitaam streen gunaan ativartate.
Arjuna said:
21. What are the marks of him who has crossed over the three qualities, O Lord? What is his
conduct and how does he go beyond these three qualities?
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Prakaasham cha pravrittim cha mohameva cha paandava;
Na dweshti sampravrittaani na nivrittaani kaangkshati.
The Blessed Lord said:
22. Light, activity and delusion,—when they are present, O Arjuna, he hates not, nor does
he long for them when they are absent!
Udaaseenavadaaseeno gunairyo na vichaalyate;
Gunaa vartanta ityeva yo’vatishthati nengate.
23. He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the qualities, and who, knowing
that the qualities are active, is self-centred and moves not,
Samaduhkhasukhah swasthah samaloshtaashmakaanchanah;
Tulyapriyaapriyo dheeras tulyanindaatma samstutih.
