  117    Genesis 48 
26  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that 
Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests 
 
only, which became not Pharaoh’s. 
27  ¶ And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; 
 
and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied 
exceedingly. 
28  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole 
 
age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years. 
29  ¶ And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son 
 
Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, 
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and 
truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 
   
30  but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, 
and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou 
hast said. 
31  And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel 
bowed himself upon the bed’s head. 
48 
Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh 
1  And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, 
thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and 
 
Ephraim. 
2  And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto 
thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 
 
3  And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at 
Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
4  and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply 
thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give 
 
this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.  
5  And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born 
unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, 
are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
