  358    Numbers 20 
persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one 
slain, or one dead, or a grave: 
 
19  and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third 
day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify 
 
himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall 
be clean at even. 
20  ¶ But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, 
that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he 
hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord: the water of separation 
 
hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 
 
21  And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that 
sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he 
 
that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. 
22  And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and 
 
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

Water from the Rock 
1  Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into 
the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in 
 
Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
 
2  ¶ And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered 
 
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
3  And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God 
that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord! 
 
4  And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into 
this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 
 
5  And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring 
us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, 
 
or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. 
 
6  And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto 
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon 
their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
