  1376    Psalms 125 
the stream had gone over our soul: 
 
5  then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
6  Blessed be the Lord, 
who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
7  Our soul is escaped as a bird 
out of the snare of the fowlers: 
 
the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
8  Our help is in the name of the Lord, 
who made heaven and earth. 
125 
The Lord Is Round about His People 
A Song of degrees. 
1  They that trust in the Lord 
shall be as mount Zion, 
which cannot be removed, 
but abideth for ever. 
2  As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, 
so the Lord is round about his people 
from henceforth even for ever. 
3  For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the 
righteous; 
 
lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 
4  Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, 
and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
5  As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, 
the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: 
 
but peace shall be upon Israel.
