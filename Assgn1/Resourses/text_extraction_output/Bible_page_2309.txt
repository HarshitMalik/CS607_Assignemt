  2310    Acts 2 
9  Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in 
Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 
10  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about 
Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 
11  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the 
wonderful works of God. 
12  And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to 
another, What meaneth this? 
 
13  Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. 
Peter’s Address at Pentecost 
14  ¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and 
said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, 
be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 
 
15  for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third 
hour of the day. 
16  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 
 
17  And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, 
I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: 
 
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, 
and your young men shall see visions, 
and your old men shall dream dreams: 
 
18  and on my servants and on my handmaidens 
I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; 
 
and they shall prophesy: 
 
19  and I will show wonders in heaven above, 
and signs in the earth beneath; 
 
blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: 
 
20  the sun shall be turned into darkness, 
and the moon into blood, 
before that great and notable day of the Lord come: 
 
21  and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of 
the Lord shall be saved.
