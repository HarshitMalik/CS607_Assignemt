SANKHYA YOGA
The Blessed Lord said:
2. Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of thee,
disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon thee, O Arjuna?
Klaibyam maa sma gamah paartha naitat twayyupapadyate;
Kshudram hridaya daurbalyam tyaktwottishtha parantapa.
3. Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha! It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean
weakness of the heart. Stand up, O scorcher of foes!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Katham bheeshmamaham sankhye dronam cha madhusoodana;
Ishubhih pratiyotsyaami poojaarhaavarisoodana.
Arjuna said:
4. How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona,
who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?
Guroon ahatwaa hi mahaanubhaavaan
Shreyo bhoktum bhaikshyam apeeha loke;
Hatwaarthakaamaamstu guroon ihaiva
Bhunjeeya bhogaan rudhirapradigdhaan.
5. Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if
I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and desires will be stained with (their)
blood.
Na chaitad vidmah kataran no gareeyo
Yadwaa jayema yadi vaa no jayeyuh;
Yaan eva hatwaa na jijeevishaamas
Te’vasthitaah pramukhe dhaartaraashtraah.
6. I can hardly tell which will be better: that we should conquer them or they should conquer
us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.
Kaarpanyadoshopahataswabhaavah
Pricchaami twaam dharmasammoodha chetaah;
Yacchreyah syaan nishchitam broohi tanme
Shishyaste’ham shaadhi maam twaam prapannam.
7. My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity, my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee:
tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.
Na hi prapashyaami mamaapanudyaad
