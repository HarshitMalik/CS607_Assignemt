  1708    Jeremiah 42 
2  and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our 
supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the 
Lord thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of 
 
many, as thine eyes do behold us:) 
 
3  that the Lord thy God may show us the way wherein we may 
walk, and the thing that we may do. 
4  Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; 
 
behold, I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your 
words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the Lord 
 
shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back 
 
from you. 
5  Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful 
witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the 
which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us. 
6  Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of 
the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with 
 
us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God. 
7  Â¶ And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord 
came unto Jeremiah. 
8  Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of 
the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least 
even to the greatest, 
9  and said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto 
whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him; 
 
10  If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull 
you down; and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent 
   
me of the evil that I have done unto you. 
11  Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not 
 
afraid of him, saith the Lord: for I am with you to save you, and to 
 
deliver you from his hand. 
12  And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon 
you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
13  But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice 
of the Lord your God,
