  1477    Ecclesiastes 11 
15  The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he 
knoweth not how to go to the city. 
16  ¶ Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat 
in the morning! 
 
17  Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and 
thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for

6  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not 
thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this 
 
or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. 
7  ¶ Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to 
behold the sun:
