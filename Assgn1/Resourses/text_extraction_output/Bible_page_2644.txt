  2645    Revelation 19 
22  And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and 
trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, 
 
of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the 
 
sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; 
 
23  and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the 
 
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at 
all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for 
   
by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. 
24  And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of 
all that were slain upon the earth.

The Multitude in Heaven Praises God 
1  And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in 
heaven, saying, 
Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord 
 
our God: 
 
2  for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the 
 
great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and 
hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.  
3  And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and 
ever.  
4  And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and 
worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. 
 
5  And a voice came out of the throne, saying, 
Praise our God, all ye his servants, 
and ye that fear him, both small and great.  
6  And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the 
voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, 
saying, 
Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. 
 
7  Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage 
 
of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
