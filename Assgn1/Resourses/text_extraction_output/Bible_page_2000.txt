corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s 
winepresses. 
11  And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter 
destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. 
 
12  ¶ And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all 
the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall 
 
consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall 
consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away 
in their mouth. 
13  And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the 
Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on 
 
the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the 
hand of his neighbor. 
14  And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the 
 
heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, 
and apparel, in great abundance. 
15  And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, 
and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as 
this plague. 
16  ¶ And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the 
nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year 
to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the 
feast of tabernacles.  
17  And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of 
the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, 
even upon them shall be no rain. 
18  And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no 
rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite the 
 
heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
19  This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all 
nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
20  ¶ In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness 
unto the Lord; and the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like 
 
the bowls before the altar.
