  882    2 Kings 18 
28  ¶ Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ 
language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the 
king of Assyria: 
 
29  thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not 
 
be able to deliver you out of his hand: 
 
30  neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The 
Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into 
the hand of the king of Assyria. 
31  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 
 
an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat 
ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and 
drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 
 
32  until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land 
of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive 
and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto 
 
Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The Lord will deliver 
us. 
33  Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of 
the hand of the king of Assyria? 
 
34  Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods 
 
of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out 
 
of mine hand? 
 
35  Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have 
delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should 
deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? 
 
36  ¶ But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: 
 
for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
37  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the 
household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the 
recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the 
words of Rab-shakeh.
