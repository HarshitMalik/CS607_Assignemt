  1317    Psalms 86 
and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 
6  Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; 
 
and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
7  In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: 
 
for thou wilt answer me. 
8  Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; 
 
neither are there any works like unto thy works. 
9  All nations whom thou hast made 
shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; 
 
and shall glorify thy name.  
10  For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: 
 
thou art God alone. 
11  Teach me thy way, O Lord; 
 
I will walk in thy truth: 
 
unite my heart to fear thy name. 
12  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: 
 
and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
13  For great is thy mercy toward me: 
 
and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
14  O God, the proud are risen against me, 
and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; 
 
and have not set thee before them. 
15  But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, 
long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
16  O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; 
 
give thy strength unto thy servant, 
and save the son of thine handmaid. 
17  Show me a token for good; 
 
that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: 
 
because thou, Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
