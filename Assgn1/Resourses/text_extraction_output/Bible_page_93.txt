  94    Genesis 39 
39 
Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife 
1  And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of 
 
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the 
hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. 
2  And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and 
 
he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
3  And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the 
Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
4  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he 
 
made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into 
his hand. 
5  And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in 
his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the 
Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord 
 
was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 
6  And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught 
 
he had, save the bread which he did eat. 
¶ And Joseph was a goodly person, and well-favored. 
7  And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her 
eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
 
8  But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master 
wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed 
all that he hath to my hand; 
 
9  there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back 
 
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then 
 
can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 
 
10  And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he 
hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
11  And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house 
to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there 
 
within.
