  2641    Revelation 17 
17  Â¶ And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there 
 
came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, 
saying, It is done. 
18  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was 
 
a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, 
so mighty an earthquake, and so great. 
19  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the 
nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, 
 
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.  
20  And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  
21  And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone 
about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of 
 
the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. 
 
17 
The Judgment of the Great Harlot 
1  And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, 
and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto 
 
thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many 
waters;  
 
2  with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and 
the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine 
of her fornication.  
3  So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a 
 
woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, 
having seven heads and ten horns.  
4  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked 
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in 
her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: 
 
5  and upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, babylon 
the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of 
the earth.
