They alone are proclaimed as brave warriors in the world hereafter, who receive true 
honor in the Court of the Lord. They are honored in the Court of the Lord; they depart 
with honor, and they do not suffer pain in the world hereafter. They meditate on the 
One Lord, and obtain the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord, their fear is dispelled. 
Do not place yourself above others; dwell within your own mind. The Knower Himself 
knows everything. The death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved by God.  || 3 
||   Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a drama. The 
Lord Master beholds His work, and contemplates His creative potency. He contemplates 
His  creative  potency,  having  established  the  Universe.  He  who  created  it,  He  alone 
knows. He Himself beholds it, and He Himself understands it. He Himself realizes the 
Hukam of His Command. The One who created these things — He alone knows. His 
subtle form is infinite. Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely 
a drama.  || 4 || 2 ||   WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  DAKHANEE:  The True Creator Lord 
is True — know this well; He is the True Sustainer. He Himself fashioned Himself; the 
True  Lord  is  invisible  and  infinite.  He  brought  together  and  then  separated  the  two 
grinding stones of the earth and the sky; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. 
He created the sun and the moon; night and day, they move according to His Thought.  
|| 1 ||   O True Lord and Master, You are True. O True Lord, please bless me with Your 
Love.  ||  Pause  ||   You created the Universe; You are the Giver of pleasure and pain. 
You created woman and man, the love of poison and emotional attachment to Maya. 
The four sources of creation and the power of the Word are also of Your making. You 
give Support to all beings. You have made the Creation as Your Throne; You are the 
True Judge.  || 2 ||   You created comings and goings, but You are ever-stable, O 
Creator Lord. In birth and death, in coming and going, this soul is held in bondage by 
corruption. The evil person has forgotten the Naam; he has drowned — what can he do 
now? Forsaking merit, he has loaded the poisonous cargo of demerits; he is a trader of 
sins.  || 3 ||   The beloved soul has received the Call, the Command of the True Creator 
Lord. The husband-soul has become separated from the body-bride. The Lord is the re-
uniter  of  the  separated  ones.  No  one  cares  for  your  beauty,  O  beautiful  bride;  the 
Messenger  of  Death  is  bound  only  by  the  Commander‟s  Command.  He  does  not 
distinguish between young children and old people; he tears apart love and affection.  
|| 4 ||   The nine doors are closed by the True Lord‟s Command, and the swan-soul 
takes flight into the skies. The body-bride is separated, and defrauded by falsehood; 
she is now a widow — the dead body lies in the courtyard. The widow cries out at the 
door, “The light of my mind has gone out, O my mother, with his death.” So cry out, O 
soul-brides of the Husband Lord, and dwell on the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.  || 
5 ||   Her loved one is cleansed, bathed in water, and dressed in silken robes. The 
musicians play, and the Bani of the True Word is sung; the five relatives feel as if they 
too are dead, so deadened are their minds. “Separation from my beloved is like death 
to me!” cries the widow. “My life in this world is cursed and worthless!” But she alone is 
approved,  who  dies,  while  yet  still  alive;  she  lives  for  the  sake  of  the  Love  of  her 
Beloved.  || 6 ||   So cry out in mourning — you who have come to mourn; this world is 
false and fraudulent.
