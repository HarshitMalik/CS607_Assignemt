  1924    Joel 2 
13  ¶ Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the 
 
altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for 
   
the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the 
house of your God. 
14  Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all 
the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, 
and cry unto the Lord. 
15  ¶ Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a 
 
destruction from the Almighty shall it come.  
16  Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from 
the house of our God? 
 
17  The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, 
the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. 
 
18  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because 
 
they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 
 
19  O Lord, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures 
 
of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the 
field. 
20  The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are 
 
dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. 
2 
1  Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy 
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of 
   
the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 
 
2  a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick 
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great 
 
people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall 
 
be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. 
3  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: 
   
the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a 
desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. 
 
4  ¶ The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as 
 
horsemen, so shall they run.
