  1488    Song of Solomon 6 
6 
The Mutual Delight of the Bride and Bridegroom 
1  Whither is thy beloved gone, 
O thou fairest among women? 
 
Whither is thy beloved turned aside? 
 
that we may seek him with thee. 
2  My beloved is gone down into his garden, 
to the beds of spices, 
to feed in the gardens, 
and to gather lilies. 
3  I am my belovedâ€™s, 
and my beloved is mine: 
 
he feedeth among the lilies. 
4  Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, 
comely as Jerusalem, 
terrible as an army with banners. 
5  Turn away thine eyes from me, 
for they have overcome me: 
 
thy hair is as a flock of goats 
that appear from Gilead: 
 
6  thy teeth are as a flock of sheep 
which go up from the washing, 
whereof every one beareth twins, 
and there is not one barren among them. 
7  As a piece of a pomegranate 
are thy temples within thy locks. 
8  There are threescore queens, 
and fourscore concubines, 
and virgins without number. 
9  My dove, my undefiled is but one; 
 
she is the only one of her mother, 
she is the choice one of her that bare her. 
The daughters saw her, and blessed her;
