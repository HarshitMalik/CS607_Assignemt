  2587    1 Peter 2 
God’s Own People 
9  ¶ But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, 
a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who 
 
hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 
 
10  which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of 
God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.  
 
Live as Servants of God 
11  ¶ Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain 
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
 
12  having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, 
 
whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good 
works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 
13  ¶ Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: 
 
whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
 
14  or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the 
punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 
15  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence 
the ignorance of foolish men: 
 
16  as free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but 
as the servants of God. 
17  Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. 
The Example of Christ’s Suffering 
18  ¶ Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the 
 
good and gentle, but also to the froward. 
19  For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure 
grief, suffering wrongfully. 
20  For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall 
take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it 
 
patiently, this is acceptable with God.
