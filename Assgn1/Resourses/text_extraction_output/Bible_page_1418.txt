The Upright and the Wicked Contrasted 
1  The Proverbs of Solomon. 
A wise son maketh a glad father: 
 
but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. 
2  Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: 
 
but righteousness delivereth from death. 
3  The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: 
 
but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
4  He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: 
 
but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 
5  He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: 
 
but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 
6  Blessings are upon the head of the just: 
 
but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
7  The memory of the just is blessed: 
 
but the name of the wicked shall rot. 
8  The wise in heart will receive commandments: 
 
but a prating fool shall fall. 
9  He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: 
 
but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 
10  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: 
 
but a prating fool shall fall. 
11  The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: 
 
but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
12  Hatred stirreth up strifes: 
 
but love covereth all sins.  
13  In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: 
 
but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
14  Wise men lay up knowledge: 
 
but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
