The Territory Allotted to Ephraim and Manasseh 
1  And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, 
unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth 
up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el, 
2  and goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and passeth along unto the 
borders of Archi to Ataroth, 
3  and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of 
Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof 
 
are at the sea. 
4  ¶ So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their 
inheritance. 
5  ¶ And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their 
families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east 
 
side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper; 
 
6  and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the 
north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-
 
shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
