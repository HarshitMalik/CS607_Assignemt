Afterward,  work  on  not  letting  go  of  this  little  mystic
pass;  that  will  surely  be  a  good  way  to  produce  an
alchemical pill. But work individually, because the state of
turning  the  light  around  may  take  more  or  less  time,
depending on the individual.
Above all, donâ€™t be in a hurry. If you do not wait for a
genuine  state  to  occur  but  forcibly  withdraw  your  vision
and  consider  that  to  be  turning  the  light  around,  sitting
with your eyes closed, then positive energy cannot get in
and  negative  energy  cannot  get  out.  You  will  only  toil
uselessly, without benefit.
There are some people who roll their eyes up into their
heads  and  gaze  upward  with  excessive  force.  If  they  do
this for a long time, they will suffer either brain damage or
possibly blindness, both irreversible. This is very harmful,
so I have taken up the admonitions left by the masters over
the  ages  to  systematically  encompass  the  practical
requirements for realizing the Way.
I  have  revealed  the  mechanisms  of  mysticism  without
fear of celestial regulations, in hopes that each individual
may find out what it is to be human, and return home, to
permanent realization of the state of fulfillment of higher
development.
If  you  have  worked  for  a  long  time  but  have  not
perceived  any  truth,  it  is  because  your  mind  is  still
unstable.  Sages  taught  people  to  know  how  to  stop,  after
which there is stability, calm, and peaceful meditation. The
function  of  stabilization  is  great  indeed!  If  you  practice
