  505    Joshua 6 
6  And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, 
Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven 
trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord. 
7  And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let 
him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord. 
8  ¶ And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, 
that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns 
passed on before the Lord, and blew with the trumpets: and the 
 
ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. 
9  And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the 
trumpets, and the rearward came after the ark, the priests going on, 
and blowing with the trumpets. 
10  And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, 
nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed 
out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye 
 
shout. 
11  So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going about it once: and 
 
they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
12  ¶ And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the 
ark of the Lord. 
13  And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the 
ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: 
 
and the armed men went before them; but the rearward came after 
 
the ark of the Lord, the priests going on, and blowing with the 
trumpets. 
14  And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned 
into the camp. So they did six days. 
15  ¶ And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about 
the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same 
manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city 
 
seven times. 
16  And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with 
the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord 
 
hath given you the city.
