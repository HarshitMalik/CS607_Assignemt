  1005    2 Chronicles 17 
7  ¶ Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to 
Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and 
to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 
8  And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and 
Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and 
Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them 
 
Elishama and Jehoram, priests. 
9  And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the Lord 
with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and 
taught the people. 
10  ¶ And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands 
that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against 
Jehoshaphat. 
11  Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and 
tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand 
 
and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred 
he goats. 
12  And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah 
 
castles, and cities of store. 
13  And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of 
 
war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem. 
14  And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their 
fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and 
   
with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand. 
15  And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two 
hundred and fourscore thousand. 
16  And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered 
himself unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand 
 
mighty men of valor. 
17  And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him 
 
armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 
18  And next him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and 
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 
19  These waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the 
fenced cities throughout all Judah.
