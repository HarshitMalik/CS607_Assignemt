  1809    Ezekiel 25 
4  behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a 
possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their 
dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy

5  And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a 
couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.

the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I 
 
will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.

the nations.

the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, 
and revenged himself upon them; 
 
13  therefore thus saith the Lord God; I will also stretch out mine 
 
hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will
