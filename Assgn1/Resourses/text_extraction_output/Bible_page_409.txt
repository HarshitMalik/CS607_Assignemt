  410    Deuteronomy 2 
45  And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would 
 
not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 
46  So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye 
abode there.

The Years in the Wilderness 
1  Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the 
way of the Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed 
 
mount Seir many days. 
2  And the Lord spake unto me, saying, 
3  Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you 
 
northward. 
4  And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the 
coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; 
 
and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves 
 
therefore: 
 
5  meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not 
 
so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto 
 
Esau for a possession. 
6  Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall 
 
also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
7  For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy 
hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these 
   
forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked 
 
nothing. 
8  Â¶ And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, 
which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and 
from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the 
wilderness of Moab. 
9  And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither 
contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for
