Daniel’s Dream of the Four Beasts 
1  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream 
and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and 
 
told the sum of the matters. 
2  Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the 
four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
3  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from 
another. 
4  The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the 
 
wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, 
and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was 
given to it. 
5  And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up 
itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between 
the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 
 
6  After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon 
the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; 
   
and dominion was given to it.  
7  After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, 
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron 
 
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue 
 
with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were 
 
before it; and it had ten horns.  
 
8  I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them 
another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns 
plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the 
 
eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.  
9  ¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days 
did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head 
like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his 
 
wheels as burning fire.
