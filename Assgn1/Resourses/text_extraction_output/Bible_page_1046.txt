  1047    2 Chronicles 34 
22  ¶ And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to 
Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the 
son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in 
 
Jerusalem in the college;) and they spake to her to that effect. 
 
23  And she answered them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell ye 
the man that sent you to me, 
24  Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and 
upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in 
the book which they have read before the king of Judah: 
 
25  because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto 
other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works 
of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this 
 
place, and shall not be quenched. 
26  And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, 
so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel 
concerning the words which thou hast heard; 
 
27  Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself 
before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and 
against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, 
and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard 
 
thee also, saith the Lord. 
28  Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered 
to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I 
will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So 
they brought the king word again. 
29  ¶ Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah 
and Jerusalem. 
30  And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men 
of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the 
Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their 
 
ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the 
house of the Lord. 
31  And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, 
and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all
