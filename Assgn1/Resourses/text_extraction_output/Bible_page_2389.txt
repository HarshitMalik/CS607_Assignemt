The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Romans 
[Romans] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated 
unto the gospel of God, 
2  (which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy 
Scriptures,) 
3  concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the 
seed of David according to the flesh; 
 
4  and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the 
Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 
 
5  by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to 
the faith among all nations, for his name: 
 
6  among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 
 
7  ¶ To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: 
 
¶ Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 
Paul’s Desire to Visit Rome 
8  ¶ First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your 
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
9  For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of 
his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my 
prayers; 
 
10  making request, if by any means now at length I might have a 
prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 
11  For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual 
gift, to the end ye may be established;
