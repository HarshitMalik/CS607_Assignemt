  259    Leviticus 14 
3  and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall 
 
look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 
 
4  then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed 
two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 
 
5  and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an 
earthen vessel over running water. 
6  As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the 
scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in 
the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: 
 
7  and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the 
leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let 
the living bird loose into the open field. 
8  And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off 
all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and 
 
after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of 
his tent seven days. 
9  But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off 
his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall 
shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh 
 
in water, and he shall be clean. 
10  ¶ And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without 
blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and 
three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, 
and one log of oil: 
 
11  and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is 
to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord, at the door of 
the tabernacle of the congregation. 
12  And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass 
offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering 
before the Lord: 
 
13  and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin 
offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin 
 
offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 
   
14  and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, 
and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
