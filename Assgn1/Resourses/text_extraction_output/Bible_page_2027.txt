  2028    Matthew 8 
26  And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them 
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house 
upon the sand: 
 
27  and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 
   
28  ¶ And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the 
people were astonished at his doctrine: 
 
29  for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

Jesus Cleanses a Leper 
1  When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes 
followed him. 
2  And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, 
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
3  And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be 
 
thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
4  And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, 
 
show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses 
commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
A Centurion’s Servant Healed 
5  ¶ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto 
him a centurion, beseeching him, 
6  and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, 
grievously tormented. 
7  And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. 
8  The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou 
shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my 
 
servant shall be healed.
