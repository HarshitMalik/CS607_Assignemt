  215    Exodus 36 
22  One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus 
 
did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
23  And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south 
 
side southward: 
 
24  and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two 
 
sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under 
another board for his two tenons. 
25  And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north 
corner, he made twenty boards, 
26  and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and 
 
two sockets under another board. 
27  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
28  And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the 
two sides. 
29  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head 
thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the 
 
corners. 
30  And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets 
 
of silver, under every board two sockets. 
31  ¶ And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one 
 
side of the tabernacle, 
32  and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and 
five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
33  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the 
one end to the other. 
34  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold 
to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 
35  ¶ And he made a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine 
twined linen: with cherubim made he it of cunning work. 
 
36  And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid 
them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four 
   
sockets of silver. 
37  And he made a hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, 
and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;
