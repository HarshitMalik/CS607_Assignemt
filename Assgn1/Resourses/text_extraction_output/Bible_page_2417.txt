  2418    Romans 15 
13  ¶ Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this 
 
rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in 
his brother’s way. 
14  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing 
unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be 
 
unclean, to him it is unclean. 
15  But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not 
charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 
16  Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
 
17  for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, 
 
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
18  For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and 
approved of men. 
19  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and 
things wherewith one may edify another. 
20  For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; 
 
but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense. 
21  It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing 
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 
22  Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that 
 
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
23  And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of 
faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 
 
15 
1  We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, 
and not to please ourselves. 
2  Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. 
3  For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The 
 
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.  
4  For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our 
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures 
might have hope.
