  972    1 Chronicles 29 
27  And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years 
 
reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in 
Jerusalem.  
28  And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and 
 
Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
29  Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are 
written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan 
the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 
30  with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, 
and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
