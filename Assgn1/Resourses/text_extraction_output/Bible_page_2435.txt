  2436    1 Corinthians 8 
33  but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, 
how he may please his wife. 
34  There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried 
woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both 
in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of 
 
the world, how she may please her husband. 
35  And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare 
 
upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend 
upon the Lord without distraction. 
36  ¶ But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward 
his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let 
him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 
 
37  Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no 
necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in 
his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
38  So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that 
 
giveth her not in marriage doeth better. 
39  ¶ The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if 
 
her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she 
will; only in the Lord. 
 
40  But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think 
 
also that I have the Spirit of God.

Food Offered to Idols 
1  Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all 
have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
2  And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth 
nothing yet as he ought to know. 
3  But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
4  ¶ As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered 
in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the 
world, and that there is none other God but one.
