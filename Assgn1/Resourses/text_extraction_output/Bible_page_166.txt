them. 
9  And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done 
to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
10  ¶ And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out 
of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who 
hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

12  And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and 
sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to 
 
eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
