  2586    1 Peter 2 
23  being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by 
the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
24  For all flesh is as grass, 
and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. 
The grass withereth, 
and the flower thereof falleth away: 
 
25  but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.  
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. 
2 
1  Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, 
and envies, and all evil speakings, 
2  as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may 
grow thereby: 
 
3  if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.  
Christ the Living Stone 
4  Â¶ To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of 
men, but chosen of God, and precious, 
5  ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy 
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by 
Jesus Christ. 
6  Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture, 
Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: 
 
and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.  
7  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them 
 
which be disobedient, 
the stone which the builders disallowed, 
the same is made the head of the corner,  
8  and a stone of stumbling, 
and a rock of offense,  
even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: 
 
whereunto also they were appointed.
