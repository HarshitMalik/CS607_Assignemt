  535    Joshua 18 
of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the 
east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them. 
8  ¶ And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them 
 
that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the 
land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast 
lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh. 
9  And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by 
cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the 
host at Shiloh. 
10  And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord: and there 
 
Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to 
their divisions. 
11  ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up 
according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth 
 
between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
12  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the 
 
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went 
up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof 
 
were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
13  And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of 
Luz, which is Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to 
 
Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether 
Beth-horon. 
14  And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the 
sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon 
southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which 
 
is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west 
 
quarter. 
15  And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the 
border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of 
Nephtoah: 
 
16  and the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth 
before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley 
of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, 
to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
