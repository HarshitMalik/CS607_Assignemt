  1587    Isaiah 53 
6  Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know 
 
in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I. 
 
7  ¶ How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that 
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good 
 
tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, 
 
Thy God reigneth! 
 
8  Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall 
 
they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring 
 
again Zion. 
9  Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for 
 
the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. 
10  The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the 
nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our 
 
God. 
11  ¶ Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean 
thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels 
   
of the Lord. 
12  For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord 
 
will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward. 
 
The Suffering of the Lord’s Servant 
13  ¶ Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and 
extolled, and be very high. 
14  As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more 
 
than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
 
15  so shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths 
 
at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and 
   
that which they had not heard shall they consider.  
53 
1  Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the 
 
Lord revealed?
