  551    Joshua 24 
14  ¶ Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in 
truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the 
 
other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. 
 
15  And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day 
whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served 
 
that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, 
in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve 
 
the Lord. 
16  ¶ And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should 
forsake the Lord, to serve other gods; 
 
17  for the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers 
out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did 
those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way 
wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we 
passed: 
 
18  and the Lord drave out from before us all the people, even the 
Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the 
 
Lord; for he is our God. 
 
19  ¶ And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for 
 
he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your 
   
transgressions nor your sins. 
20  If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn 
and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you 
good. 
21  And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the Lord. 
 
22  And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against 
yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him. And 
they said, We are witnesses. 
23  Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among 
you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel. 
24  And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, 
and his voice will we obey. 
25  So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a 
statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
