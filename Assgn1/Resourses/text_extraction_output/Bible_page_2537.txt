10  but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus 
Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and 
immortality to light through the gospel: 
 
11  whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher 
of the Gentiles.  
12  For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not 
 
ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that 
 
he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against 
that day. 
13  Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in 
faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
14  That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy 
Ghost which dwelleth in us. 
15  Â¶ This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away 
from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 
 
16  The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft 
 
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 
 
17  but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and 
found me. 
18  The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in 
that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at 
 
Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

A Good Soldier of Jesus Christ 
1  Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ 
Jesus. 
2  And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, 
the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach 
others also. 
3  Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
4  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; 
 
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
