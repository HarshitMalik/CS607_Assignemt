The Celebration of the Passover 
1  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to 
Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God of 
Israel. 
2  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the 
congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second 
month. 
3  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not 
sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered 
themselves together to Jerusalem.  
4  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. 
5  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all 
Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep 
the passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they 
 
had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written. 
6  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes 
throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the 
commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again 
unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will 
return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of 
the kings of Assyria. 
7  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which 
trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore 
gave them up to desolation, as ye see. 
8  Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves 
unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath 
sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the 
 
fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. 
9  For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your 
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, 
so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God
