  1013    2 Chronicles 21 
30  So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest 
 
round about. 
The Reign of Jehoshaphat 
31  ¶ And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years 
 
old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in 
Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of 
Shilhi. 
32  And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from 
it, doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord. 
33  Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people 
 
had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 
34  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, 
they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is 
mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. 
35  ¶ And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with 
Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 
 
36  and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: 
 
and they made the ships in Ezion-gaber. 
37  Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against 
Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with 
Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken thy works. And the ships were 
broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

The Reign of Jehoram of Judah 
1  Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his 
stead. 
2  And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, 
and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all 
 
these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
