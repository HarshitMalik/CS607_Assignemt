  1701    Jeremiah 38 
19  And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews 
that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their 
hand, and they mock me. 
20  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, 
the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well 
 
unto thee, and thy soul shall live. 
21  But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath 
showed me: 
 
22  And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s 
house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and 
those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have 
prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are 
 
turned away back. 
23  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the 
Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be 
 
taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this 
 
city to be burned with fire. 
24  ¶ Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these 
words, and thou shalt not die. 
25  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come 
unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast 
said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to 
death; also what the king said unto thee: 
   
26  Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before 
the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, 
to die there. 
27  Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he 
 
told them, according to all these words that the king had 
commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was 
 
not perceived. 
28  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that 
Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
