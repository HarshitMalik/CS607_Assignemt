  1264    Psalms 50 
20  Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, 
is like the beasts that perish.

God Is the Judge 
A Psalm of Asaph. 
1  The mighty God, even the Lord, 
hath spoken, and called the earth 
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 
2  Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, 
God hath shined. 
3  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: 
 
a fire shall devour before him, 
and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 
4  He shall call to the heavens from above, 
and to the earth, that he may judge his people. 
5  Gather my saints together unto me; 
 
those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
6  And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: 
 
for God is judge himself. 
Selah. 
7  Hear, O my people, and I will speak; 
 
O Israel, and I will testify against thee: 
 
I am God, even thy God. 
8  I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices 
or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. 
9  I will take no bullock out of thy house, 
nor he goats out of thy folds: 
 
10  for every beast of the forest is mine, 
and the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
11  I know all the fowls of the mountains: 
 
and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
