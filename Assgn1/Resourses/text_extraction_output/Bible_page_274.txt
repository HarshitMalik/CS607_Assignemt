  275    Leviticus 19 
24  But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the 
Lord withal. 
25  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may 
yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the Lord your God. 
 
26  ¶ Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use 
 
enchantment, nor observe times. 
27  Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou 
mar the corners of thy beard. 
28  Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print 
any marks upon you: I am the Lord. 
 
29  ¶ Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest 
 
the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. 
30  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
 
Lord.  
31  ¶ Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after 
wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God. 
 
32  ¶ Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of 
the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord. 
 
33  ¶ And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex 
him. 
34  But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one 
born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were 
 
strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 
 
35  ¶ Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in 
weight, or in measure. 
36  Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye 
have: I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land 
 
of Egypt. 
37  Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, 
and do them: I am the Lord.
