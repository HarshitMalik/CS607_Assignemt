The Psalms 
[Psalms] 
1 
The Righteous and the Ungodly 
1  Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, 
nor standeth in the way of sinners, 
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 
2  But his delight is in the law of the Lord; 
 
and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
3  And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,  
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; 
 
his leaf also shall not wither; 
 
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 
4  The ungodly are not so: 
 
but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
5  Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, 
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
6  For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: 
 
but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

The Reign of the Lordâ€™s Anointed 
1  Why do the heathen rage, 
and the people imagine a vain thing? 
 
2  The kings of the earth set themselves, 
and the rulers take counsel together, 
against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, 
3  Let us break their bands asunder, 
and cast away their cords from us. 
4  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
