I  cannot  live  without  Him,  even  for  an  instant.    ||  1  ||      You  have  saved  so  many 
devotees,  so  many  humble  servants;  so  many  silent  sages  contemplate  You.  The 
support of the blind, the wealth of the poor; Nanak has found God, of endless virtues.

O Enticing Lord, I cannot sleep; I sigh. I am adorned with necklaces, gowns, ornaments 
and make-up. I am sad, sad and depressed. When will You come home?  || 1 ||  Pause  
||   I seek the Sanctuary of the happy soul-brides; I place my head upon their feet. 
Unite  me  with  my  Beloved.  When  will  He  come  to  my  home?    ||  1  ||      Listen,  my 
companions: tell me how to meet Him. Eradicate all egotism, and then you shall find 
your Beloved Lord within the home of your heart. Then, in delight, you shall sing the 
songs of joy and praise. Meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of bliss. O Nanak, I 
came to the Lord‟s Door, and then, I found my Beloved.  || 2 ||   The Enticing Lord has 
revealed  His  form  to  me,  and  now,  sleep  seems  sweet  to  me.  My  thirst  is  totally 
quenched,  and  now,  I  am  absorbed  in  celestial  bliss.  How  sweet  is  the story of my 
Husband Lord. I have found my Beloved, Enticing Lord.  ||  Second Pause  || 1 || 128 ||   
BILAAVAL,  FIFTH MEHL:  My ego is gone; I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the 
Lord‟s Darshan. I  am absorbed in  my  Lord and Master, the help and support of the 
Saints. Now, I hold tight to His Feet.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   My mind longs for Him, and 
does not love any other. I am totally absorbed, in love with His Lotus Feet, like the 
bumble bee attached to the honey of the lotus flower. I do not desire any other taste; I 
seek only the One Lord.  || 1 ||   I have broken away from the others, and I have been 
released from the Messenger of Death. O mind, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord; 
join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and turn away from the world. There 
is no other, none other than the Lord. O Nanak, love the Feet, the Feet of the Lord.  ||

The Name of the Lord is the Dispeller of sorrow — realize this. Remembering Him in 
meditation, even Ajaamal the robber and Ganikaa the prostitute were liberated; let your 
soul know this.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The elephant‟s fear was taken away in an instant, as 
soon as he chanted the Lord‟s Name. Listening to Naarad‟s teachings, the child Dhroo 
was absorbed in deep meditation.  || 1 ||   He obtained the immovable, eternal state of 
fearlessness, and all the world was amazed. Says Nanak, the Lord is the Saving Grace 
and  the  Protector  of  His  devotees;  believe  it  —  He  is  close  to  you.    ||  2  ||  1  ||   
BILAAVAL,    NINTH  MEHL:    Without  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  you  shall  only  find pain. 
Without devotional worship, doubt is not dispelled; the Guru has revealed this secret.  
|| 1 ||  Pause  ||   Of what use are sacred shrines of pilgrimage, if one does not enter 
the Sanctuary of the Lord?
