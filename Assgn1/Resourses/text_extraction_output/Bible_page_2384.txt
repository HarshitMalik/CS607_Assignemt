  2385    Acts 27 
24  saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, 
   
God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. 
25  Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be 
 
even as it was told me. 
26  Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. 
27  ¶ But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up 
and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they 
drew near to some country; 
 
28  and sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had 
 
gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen 
fathoms. 
29  Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four 
anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. 
30  And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they 
had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they 
would have cast anchors out of the foreship, 
31  Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in 
the ship, ye cannot be saved. 
32  Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. 
33  ¶ And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take 
meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried 
and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 
34  Wherefore I pray you to take some meat; for this is for your health: 
   
for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you. 
35  And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to 
God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began 
 
to eat. 
36  Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. 
37  And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen 
souls. 
38  And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast 
out the wheat into the sea.
