  1386    Psalms 137 
for his mercy endureth for ever: 
 
22  even a heritage unto Israel his servant: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever. 
23  Who remembered us in our low estate: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever: 
 
24  and hath redeemed us from our enemies: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever. 
25  Who giveth food to all flesh: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever. 
26  O give thanks unto the God of heaven: 
 
for his mercy endureth for ever.

The Mourning of the Exiles in Babylon 
1  By the rivers of Babylon, 
there we sat down, yea, we wept, 
when we remembered Zion. 
2  We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 
3  For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; 
 
and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, 
Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 
4  How shall we sing the Lordâ€™s song in a strange land? 
 
5  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, 
let my right hand forget her cunning. 
6  If I do not remember thee, 
let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; 
 
if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
7  Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom 
in the day of Jerusalem; 
 
who said, Rase it, rase it, 
even to the foundation thereof. 
8  O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; 
 
happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
