  402    Numbers 35 
10  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be 
come over Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
11  then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that 
the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. 
12  And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that 
 
the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in 
judgment. 
13  And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for 
refuge. 
14  Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye 
give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. 
15  These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and 
for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them; that every one 
 
that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. 
16  ¶ And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he 
is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
 
17  And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, 
and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to 
 
death. 
18  Or if he smite him with a hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may 
die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to 
 
death. 
19  The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he 
 
meeteth him, he shall slay him. 
20  But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that 
he die; 
 
21  or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote 
 
him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of 
   
blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. 
22  ¶ But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon 
him any thing without laying of wait, 
23  or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and 
cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought 
his harm:
