Y  URU‟S  RACE:   
Among the months, blessed is this month, when spring always comes. Blossom forth, O 
my consciousness, contemplating the Lord of the Universe, forever and ever.  || 1 ||   O 
ignorant one, forget your egotistical intellect. Subdue your ego, and contemplate Him in 
your  mind;  gather  in  the  virtues  of  the  Sublime,  Virtuous  Lord.    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||   
Karma  is  the  tree,  the  Lord‟s  Name  the  branches,  Dharmic  faith  the  flowers,  and 
spiritual wisdom the fruit. Realization of the Lord are the leaves, and eradication of the 
pride of the mind is the shade.  || 2 ||   Whoever sees the Lord‟s Creative Power with 
his eyes, and hears the Guru‟s Bani with his ears, and utters the True Name with his 
mouth, attains the perfect wealth of honor, and intuitively focuses his meditation on the 
Lord.  || 3 ||   The months and the seasons come; see, and do your deeds. O Nanak, 
those  Gurmukhs  who  remain  merged  in  the  Lord  do  not  wither  away;  they  remain 
green forever.  || 4 || 1 ||   FIRST MEHL,  BASANT:  The season of spring, so delightful, 
has come. Those who are imbued with love for You, O Lord, chant Your Name with joy. 
Whom else should I worship? At whose feet should I bow?  || 1 ||   I am the slave of 
Your slaves, O my Sovereign Lord King. O Life of the Universe, there is no other way to 
meet You.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   You have only One Form, and yet You have countless 
forms.  Which  one  should  I  worship?  Before  which  one  should  I  burn  incense?  Your 
limits cannot be found. How can anyone find them? I am the slave of Your slaves, O my 
Sovereign Lord King.  || 2 ||   The cycles of years and the places of pilgrimage are 
Yours, O Lord. Your Name is True, O Transcendent Lord God. Your State cannot be 
known,  O  Eternal,  Unchanging  Lord  God.  Although  You  are  unknown,  still  we  chant 
Your Name.  || 3 ||   What can poor Nanak say? All people praise the One Lord. Nanak 
places his head on the feet of such people. I am a sacrifice to Your Names, as many as 
there are, O Lord.  || 4 || 2 ||   BASANT,  FIRST MEHL:  The kitchen is golden, and the 
cooking pots are golden. The lines marking the cooking square are silver. The water is 
from the Ganges, and the firewood is sanctified. The food is soft rice, cooked in milk. ||
