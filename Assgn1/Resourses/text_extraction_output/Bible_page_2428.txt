  2429    1 Corinthians 4 
16  ¶ Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of 
God dwelleth in you?  
 
17  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the 
 
temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 
18  ¶ Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be 
wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God: for it is 
 
written, 
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.  
20  And again, 
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, 
that they are vain.  
21  Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours; 
   
22  whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, 
or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
   
23  and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.

3  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, 
or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
 
4  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he 
   
that judgeth me is the Lord. 
5  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who 
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will 
make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man 
 
have praise of God. 
6  ¶ And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to 
myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not
