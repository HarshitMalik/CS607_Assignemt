  254    Leviticus 13 
13 
Laws concerning Leprosy 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 
2  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or 
bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of 
leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto 
 
one of his sons the priests: 
 
3  and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and 
 
when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight 
be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the 
 
priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 
4  If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be 
not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; 
 
then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days: 
 
5  and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the 
 
plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the 
skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: 
   
6  and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, 
 
behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not 
in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: 
   
and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
7  But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath 
been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the 
priest again: 
 
8  and if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, 
then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy. 
 
9  Â¶ When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought 
unto the priest; 
 
10  and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the 
 
skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh 
in the rising;
