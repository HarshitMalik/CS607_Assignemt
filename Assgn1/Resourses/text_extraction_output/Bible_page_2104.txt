my sister, and mother.

The Parable of the Sower 
1  And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered 
 
unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat 
in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 
 
2  And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them 
in his doctrine, 
3  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 
   
4  and it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the 
fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 
5  And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and 
 
immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 
 
6  but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no 
 
root, it withered away. 
7  And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked 
it, and it yielded no fruit. 
8  And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up 
and increased, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and 
some a hundred. 
9  And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
10  Â¶ And when he was alone, they that were about him with the 
twelve asked of him the parable. 
11  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of 
the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these 
 
things are done in parables: 
 
12  that seeing they may see, and not perceive; 
 
and hearing they may hear, and not understand; 
 
lest at any time they should be converted, 
and their sins should be forgiven them.
