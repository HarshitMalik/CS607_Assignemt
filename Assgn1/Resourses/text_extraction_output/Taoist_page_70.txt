Seeing  and  hearing  are  like  food  and  drink;  you  need
them every day, but you also need to digest and eliminate
them  every  day.  If  they  are  not  digested  and  eliminated
thoroughly,  they  remain  in  the  gut,  eventually  producing
illness.
KNOWLEDGE
The  foremost  priority  of  learning  is  attaining  knowledge.
Attaining  knowledge  is  a  matter  of  investigating  things.
Having studied, think; having thought, study.
When  you  reach  the  point  of  comprehensive
penetration, then knowledge is reached. When knowledge
is reached, then sincerity of intention and wholesomeness
of mind can gradually be attained.
The  knowledge  of  learners  is  limited,  whereas  there  is
no  end  to  the  principles  of  the  world.  Therefore  when
something  is  known,  there  is  inevitably  something
unknown.  When  you  come  to  know  the  unknown,  then
there is something else unknown. That is why poets have
used the metaphor “like cutting and polishing.”
It  is  not  that  people  have  no  knowledge,  but  true
knowledge  is  hard.  When  it  comes  to  pearls  and  jades,
everyone  wants  to  pick  them  up  and  put  them  in  their
pockets—why  is  that?  True  knowledge  is  such  a  treasure
that if students of the Way had this attitude there would be
no worry that no one would strive for true knowledge.
