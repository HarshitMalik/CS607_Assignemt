  233    Leviticus 4 
7  And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the 
altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle 
of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at 
 
the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of 
the tabernacle of the congregation. 
8  And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin 
offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is 
 
upon the inwards, 
9  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the 
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he 
take away, 
10  as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace 
offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the 
 
burnt offering. 
11  And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and 
with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
12  even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto 
a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the 
wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. 
 
13  ¶ And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, 
and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have 
done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord 
concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; 
 
14  when the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the 
congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him 
before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
15  And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the 
head of the bullock before the Lord; and the bullock shall be killed 
 
before the Lord. 
16  And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to 
the tabernacle of the congregation: 
 
17  and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle 
it seven times before the Lord, even before the veil. 
18  And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar 
which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the
