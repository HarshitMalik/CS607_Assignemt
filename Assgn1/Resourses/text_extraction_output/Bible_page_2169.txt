  2170    Luke 6 
6 
The Disciples Pluck Grain on the Sabbath 
1  And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he 
went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of 
 
corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. 
2  And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which 
is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 
 
3  And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, 
what David did, when himself was ahungered, and they which 
were with him; 
 
4  how he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the 
showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is 
 
not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? 
 
5  And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the 
sabbath. 
The Man with a Withered Hand 
6  Â¶ And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into 
the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand 
 
was withered. 
7  And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal 
on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. 
 
8  But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the 
withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose 
and stood forth. 
9  Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on 
 
the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy 
 
it? 
 
10  And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, 
Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored 
 
whole as the other.
