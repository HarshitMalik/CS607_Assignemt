  1534    Isaiah 26 
7  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast 
over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. 
8  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe 
 
away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he 
 
take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. 
 
9  ¶ And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited 
 
for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for 
   
him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 
10  ¶ For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab 
shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down 
for the dunghill. 
11  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that 
swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring 
 
down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. 
12  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, 
lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

A Song of Trust in the Lord’s Protection 
1  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; 
 
We have a strong city; 
 
salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. 
2  Open ye the gates, 
that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. 
3  Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, 
whose mind is stayed on thee: 
 
because he trusteth in thee. 
4  Trust ye in the Lord for ever: 
 
for in the Lord Jehovah 
is everlasting strength. 
5  For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; 
 
the lofty city, he layeth it low; 
 
he layeth it low, even to the ground;
