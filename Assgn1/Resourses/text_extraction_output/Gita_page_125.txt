THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION OF THE THREE GUNAS
Sarvadwaareshu dehe’smin prakaasha upajaayate;
Jnaanam yadaa tadaa vidyaa dvivriddham sattwamityuta.
11. When, through every gate (sense) in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be
known that Sattwa is predominant.
Lobhah pravrittir aarambhah karmanaam ashamah sprihaa;
Rajasyetaani jaayante vivriddhe bharatarshabha.
12. Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing—these arise when
Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna!
Aprakaasho’pravrittishcha pramaado moha eva cha;
Tamasyetaani jaayante vivriddhe kurunandana.
13. Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion—these arise when Tamas is
predominant, O Arjuna!
Yadaa sattwe pravriddhe tu pralayam yaati dehabhrit;
Tadottamavidaam lokaan amalaan pratipadyate.
14. If the embodied one meets with death when Sattwa has become predominant, then he
attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.
Rajasi pralayam gatwaa karmasangishu jaayate;
Tathaa praleenastamasi moodhayonishu jaayate.
15. Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in
Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless.
Karmanah sukritasyaahuh saattwikam nirmalam phalam;
Rajasastu phalam duhkham ajnaanam tamasah phalam.
16. The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattwic and pure; the fruit of Rajas is pain, and
ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.
Sattwaat sanjaayate jnaanam rajaso lobha eva cha;
Pramaadamohau tamaso bhavato’jnaanameva cha.
17. From Sattwa arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise
from Tamas, and ignorance also.
Oordhwam gacchanti sattwasthaa madhye tishthanti raajasaah;
Jaghanyagunavrittisthaa adho gacchanti taamasaah.
