13  and he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an 
everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and

14  ¶ Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain 
with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of 
a chief house among the Simeonites. 
15  And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, 
the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house 
 
in Midian. 
16  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
17  Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 
 
18  for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled 
you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter 
of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the 
plague for Peor’s sake.

Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 
2  Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from 
twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers’ house, all 
that are able to go to war in Israel. 
3  And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of 
Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 
4  Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the 
 
Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went 
forth out of the land of Egypt. 
5  ¶ Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, 
   
of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of 
 
the Palluites: 
 
6  of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi, the family of 
 
the Carmites.
