  2434    1 Corinthians 7 
4  The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and 
 
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the 
wife. 
5  Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, 
that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come 
 
together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 
6  But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. 
7  For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath 
his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after 
that. 
8  ¶ I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them 
if they abide even as I. 
9  But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry 
 
than to burn. 
10  ¶ And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not 
the wife depart from her husband: 
 
11  but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to 
her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  
 
12  ¶ But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife 
 
that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him 
not put her away. 
13  And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and if he 
be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the 
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your 
 
children unclean; but now are they holy. 
 
15  But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is 
not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. 
 
16  For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy 
husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save 
 
thy wife? 
 
17  ¶ But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called 
every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
