  2140    Mark 14 
Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus 
10  ¶ And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, 
to betray him unto them. 
11  And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him 
money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. 
Jesus Eats the Passover with His Disciples 
12  ¶ And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the 
passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go 
and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? 
 
13  And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go 
ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of 
water: follow him. 
 
14  And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the 
house, The Master saith, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall 
eat the passover with my disciples? 
 
15  And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: 
 
there make ready for us. 
16  And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as 
he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
 
17  ¶ And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 
18  And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of 
you which eateth with me shall betray me. 
19  And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is 
it I? and another said, Is it I? 
   
20  And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that 
dippeth with me in the dish. 
21  The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to 
 
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for 
 
that man if he had never been born. 
22  ¶ And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, 
and gave to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
