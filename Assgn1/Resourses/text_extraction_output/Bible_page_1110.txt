  1111    Nehemiah 13 
27  Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to 
transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? 
 
28  ¶ And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, 
was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him 
 
from me. 
29  Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the 
priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. 
30  ¶ Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards 
of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 
 
31  and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the 
firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
