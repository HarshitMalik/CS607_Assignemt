  346    Numbers 15 
14  And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in 
your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savor unto the Lord; as ye do, so he shall do. 
 
15  One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for 
the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your 
generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. 
 
16  One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that 
sojourneth with you.  
17  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
18  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye 
come into the land whither I bring you, 
19  then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall 
offer up a heave offering unto the Lord. 
20  Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for a heave 
offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall 
 
ye heave it. 
21  Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord a heave 
offering in your generations. 
22  ¶ And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, 
which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses, 
23  even all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, 
from the day that the Lord commanded Moses, and henceforward 
among your generations; 
 
24  then it shall be, if aught be committed by ignorance without the 
knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer 
one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor unto the 
Lord, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to 
the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. 
25  And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of 
the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is 
 
ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by 
 
fire unto the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord, for 
their ignorance:
