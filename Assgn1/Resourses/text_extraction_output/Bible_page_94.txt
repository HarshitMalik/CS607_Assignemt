  95    Genesis 39 
12  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he 
 
left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
13  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in 
her hand, and was fled forth, 
14  that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, 
saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he 
 
came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
 
15  and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and 
cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
16  And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
17  And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The 
Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto 
me to mock me: 
 
18  and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his 
garment with me, and fled out. 
19  ¶ And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, 
which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy 
servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
 
20  And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place 
where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the 
 
prison. 
21  But the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave 
him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 
22  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the 
prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he 
 
was the doer of it. 
23  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his 
hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the 
 
Lord made it to prosper.
