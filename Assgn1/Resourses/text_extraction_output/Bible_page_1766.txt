porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their 
backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the 
east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his 
hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a 
 
writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the 
 
brazen altar.
