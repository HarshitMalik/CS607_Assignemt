28  ¶ And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, 
the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated 
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their 
wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having 
knowledge, and having understanding; 
 
29  they clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, 
and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses 
the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments 
of the Lord our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes; 
 
30  and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the 
land, nor take their daughters for our sons:  
 
31  and if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the 
sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the 
sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh 
 
year, and the exaction of every debt.  
32  ¶ Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with 
the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;  
 
33  for the showbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the 
continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the 
set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make 
an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our 
God. 
34  And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, 
for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after 
the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn 
upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law:
