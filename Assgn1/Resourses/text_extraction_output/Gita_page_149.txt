THE YOGA OF LIBERATION BY RENUNCIATION
Sahajam karma kaunteya sadoshamapi na tyajet;
Sarvaarambhaa hi doshena dhoomenaagnirivaavritaah.
48. One should not abandon, O Arjuna, the duty to which one is born, though faulty; for, all
undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke!
Asaktabuddhih sarvatra jitaatmaa vigatasprihah;
Naishkarmyasiddhim paramaam sannyaasenaadhigacchati.
49. He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom
desire has fled,—he by renunciation attains the supreme state of freedom from action.
Siddhim praapto yathaa brahma tathaapnoti nibodha me;
Samaasenaiva kaunteya nishthaa jnaanasya yaa paraa.
50. Learn from Me in brief, O Arjuna, how he who has attained perfection reaches
Brahman, that supreme state of knowledge.
Buddhyaa vishuddhayaa yukto dhrityaatmaanam niyamya cha;
Shabdaadeen vishayaanstyaktwaa raagadweshau vyudasya cha.
51. Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self by firmness, relinquishing sound and
other objects and abandoning both hatred and attraction,
Viviktasevee laghwaashee yatavaakkaayamaanasah;
Dhyaanayogaparo nityam vairaagyam samupaashritah.
52. Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, with speech, body and mind subdued, always
engaged in concentration and meditation, taking refuge in dispassion,
Ahankaaram balam darpam kaamam krodham parigraham;
Vimuchya nirmamah shaanto brahmabhooyaaya kalpate.
53. Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, anger, desire, and covetousness, free
from the notion of “mine” and peaceful,—he is fit for becoming Brahman.
Brahmabhootah prasannaatmaa na shochati na kaangkshati;
Samah sarveshu bhooteshu madbhaktim labhate paraam.
54. Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, he neither grieves nor desires; the same to all
beings, he attains supreme devotion unto Me.
Bhaktyaa maamabhijaanaati yaavaanyashchaasmi tattwatah;
Tato maam tattwato jnaatwaa vishate tadanantaram.
