  723    2 Samuel 13 
18  And she had a garment of divers colors upon her: for with such 
 
robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins appareled. Then 
his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 
19  And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers 
colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on 
crying. 
Absalom’s Revenge and Flight 
20  ¶ And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy 
brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy 
   
brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her 
 
brother Absalom’s house. 
21  But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 
22  And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: 
 
for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 
23  ¶ And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had 
sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and 
 
Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 
24  And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant 
hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go 
 
with thy servant. 
25  And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, 
lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he 
 
would not go, but blessed him. 
26  Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go 
with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
 
27  But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons 
go with him. 
28  Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now 
when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, 
Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? 
     
be courageous, and be valiant.
