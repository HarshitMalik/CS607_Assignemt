The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad has come to dwell within my heart.  || 3 ||   The Guru 
is  All-powerful  and  Merciful  forever.  Chanting  and  meditating  on  the  Lord,  Nanak  is 
exalted and enraptured.  || 4 || 11 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  Chanting Guru, 
Guru, I have found eternal  peace. God, Merciful to the meek, has become kind and 
compassionate; He has inspired me to chant His Name.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Joining the 
Society of the Saints, I am illumined and enlightened. Chanting the Name of the Lord, 
Har, Har, my hopes have been fulfilled.  || 1 ||   I am blessed with total salvation, and 
my mind is filled with peace. I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; O Nanak, the Guru 
has been gracious to me.  || 2 || 12 ||    
PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE,  BIBHAAS:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
There is no other place of rest, none at all, without the Lord‟s Name. There is total 
success and salvation, and all affairs are perfectly resolved.  || 1 ||   Constantly chant 
the Name of the Lord. Sexuality, anger and egotism are wiped away; let yourself fall in 
love with the One Lord.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Attached to the Naam, the Name of the 
Lord, pain  runs away. In His Sanctuary, He cherishes and sustains us. Whoever has 
such pre-ordained destiny meets with the True Guru; the Messenger of Death cannot 
grab him.  || 2 ||   Night and day, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; abandon the doubts 
of your mind. One who has perfect karma joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the 
Holy, and meets the Lord.  || 3 ||   The sinful residues of countless lifetimes are erased, 
and one is protected by the Lord Himself. He is our Mother, Father, Friend and Sibling; 
O servant Nanak, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 4 || 1 || 13 ||

Chant  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Raam,  Raam,  Raam.  Conflict,  suffering,  greed  and 
emotional attachment shall be dispelled, and the fever of egotism shall be relieved.  || 1 
||  Pause  ||   Renounce your selfishness, and grasp the feet of the Saints; your mind 
shall be sanctified, and your sins shall be taken away.  || 1 ||   Nanak, the child, does 
not know anything at all. O God, please protect me; You are my Mother and Father.  || 
2 || 1 || 14 ||   PRABHAATEE,  FIFTH MEHL:  I have taken the Shelter and Support of 
the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. You are Lofty and Exalted, Grand and Infinite, O my Lord and 
Master; You alone are above all.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   He is the Support of the breath of 
life, the Destroyer of pain, the Giver of discriminating understanding.  || 1 ||   So bow 
down in respect to the Savior Lord; worship and adore the One God. Bathing in the dust 
of the feet of the Saints, Nanak is blessed with countless comforts.  || 2 || 2 || 15 ||
