  2445    1 Corinthians 12 
11  but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to 
every man severally as he will.  
12  ¶ For as the body is one, and hath many members and all the 
members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is 
 
Christ.  
13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be 
Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all 
 
made to drink into one Spirit. 
14  ¶ For the body is not one member, but many. 
15  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the 
body; is it therefore not of the body? 
   
16  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the 
body; is it therefore not of the body? 
   
17  If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole 
 
were hearing, where were the smelling? 
 
18  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, 
as it hath pleased him. 
19  And if they were all one member, where were the body? 
 
20  But now are they many members, yet but one body. 
21  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor 
 
again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
22  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be 
more feeble, are necessary: 
 
23  and those members of the body, which we think to be less 
honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our 
 
uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. 
24  For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the 
 
body together, having given more abundant honor to that part 
which lacked: 
 
25  that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members 
 
should have the same care one for another. 
26  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or 
 
one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it. 
27  ¶ Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
