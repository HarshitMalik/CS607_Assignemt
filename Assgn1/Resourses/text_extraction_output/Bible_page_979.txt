  980    2 Chronicles 5 
16  The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their 
instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the 
house of the Lord, of bright brass. 
17  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground 
between Succoth and Zeredathah. 
18  Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the 
 
weight of the brass could not be found out. 
19  ¶ And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, 
the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the showbread was set; 
 
20  moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn 
after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 
 
21  and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and 
that perfect gold; 
 
22  and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of 
pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for 
 
the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were 
of gold.

1  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord 
was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his 
 
father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the 
 
instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. 
Solomon Brings the Ark into the Temple 
2  ¶ Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of 
the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto 
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of 
the city of David, which is Zion. 
3  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the 
king in the feast which was in the seventh month. 
4  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
