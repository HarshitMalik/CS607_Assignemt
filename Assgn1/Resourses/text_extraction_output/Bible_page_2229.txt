  2230    Luke 22 
15  And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this 
passover with you before I suffer: 
 
16  for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be 
fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
17  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and 
divide it among yourselves: 
 
18  for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the 
kingdom of God shall come. 
19  And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto 
them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in 
 
remembrance of me. 
20  Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new 
testament in my blood, which is shed for you. 
21  But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the 
table. 
22  And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe 
 
unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 
 
23  And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was 
that should do this thing. 
The Dispute about Greatness 
24  ¶ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be 
accounted the greatest.  
25  And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship 
over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called 
 
benefactors. 
26  But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be 
 
as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.  
 
27  For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is 
 
not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.  
 
28  ¶ Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. 
29  And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed 
unto me;
