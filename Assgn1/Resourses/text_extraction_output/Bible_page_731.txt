  732    2 Samuel 16 
delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, 
 
behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody 
man. 
9  ¶ Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should 
this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, 
 
and take off his head. 
10  And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? 
 
so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse 
David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
 
11  And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, 
which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more 
 
now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for 
   
the Lord hath bidden him. 
12  It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the 
Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day. 
13  And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on 
the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw 
stones at him, and cast dust. 
14  And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, 
and refreshed themselves there. 
15  ¶ And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to 
Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
16  And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was 
come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the 
king, God save the king. 
17  And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? 
 
why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
 
18  And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the Lord, and 
 
this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with 
him will I abide. 
19  And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence 
 
of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in 
 
thy presence. 
20  ¶ Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what 
we shall do.
