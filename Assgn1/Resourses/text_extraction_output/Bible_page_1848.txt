  1849    Ezekiel 41 
41 
1  Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, 
six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other 
side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. 
2  And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the 
 
door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other 
side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the 
 
breadth, twenty cubits. 
3  Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two 
cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven 
   
cubits. 
4  So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, 
 
twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the 
 
most holy place. 
5  Â¶ After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the 
 
breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house 
on every side. 
6  And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in 
order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for 
 
the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they 
had not hold in the wall of the house. 
7  And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the 
side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still 
 
upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house 
 
was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the 
highest by the midst. 
8  I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of 
 
the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. 
9  The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, 
was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side 
 
chambers that were within. 
10  And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits 
round about the house on every side.
