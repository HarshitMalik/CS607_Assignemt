  1298    Psalms 74 
I have put my trust in the Lord God, 
that I may declare all thy works. 
74 
An Appeal to God against the Enemy 
Maschil of Asaph. 
1  O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? 
 
Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 
 
2  Remember thy congregation, 
which thou hast purchased of old; 
 
the rod of thine inheritance, 
which thou hast redeemed; 
 
this mount Zion, 
wherein thou hast dwelt. 
3  Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; 
 
even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 
4  Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; 
 
they set up their ensigns for signs. 
5  A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick 
trees. 
6  But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with 
axes and hammers. 
7  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, 
they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to 
the ground. 
8  They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: 
 
they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 
9  We see not our signs: 
 
there is no more any prophet: 
 
neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 
10  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? 
 
Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
