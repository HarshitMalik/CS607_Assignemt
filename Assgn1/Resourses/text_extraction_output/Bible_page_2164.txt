  2165    Luke 4 
25  But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of 
Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, 
when great famine was throughout all the land;  
 
26  but unto none of them was Elijah sent, save unto Zarephath, a city 
of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.  
27  And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; 
 
and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.  
28  And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were 
filled with wrath, 
29  and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the 
brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast 
him down headlong. 
30  But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way, 
31  and came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them 
on the sabbath days. 
32  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with 
 
power.  
A Man with an Unclean Spirit 
33  Â¶ And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an 
unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 
34  saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of 
 
Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; 
     
the Holy One of God. 
35  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of 
him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came 
out of him, and hurt him not. 
36  And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, 
What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth 
 
the unclean spirits, and they come out. 
37  And the fame of him went out into every place of the country 
round about.
