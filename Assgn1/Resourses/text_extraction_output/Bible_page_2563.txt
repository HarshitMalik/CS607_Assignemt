  2564    Hebrews 10 
Sin Put Away by Christ’s Sacrifice 
23  ¶ It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the 
heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things 
 
themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
24  For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, 
which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to 
 
appear in the presence of God for us: 
 
25  nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest 
entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 
 
26  for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the 
world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to 
 
put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the 
judgment: 
 
28  so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them 
 
that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto 
salvation.

1  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the 
very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which 
they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto 
perfect. 
2  For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the 
 
worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of 
sins. 
3  But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins 
every year. 
4  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take 
away sins. 
5  ¶ Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, 
Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, 
but a body hast thou prepared me:
