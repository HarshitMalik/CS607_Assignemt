  2128    Mark 10 
Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time 
32  ¶ And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went 
 
before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they 
   
were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them 
what things should happen unto him, 
33  saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be 
 
delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall 
 
condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: 
 
34  and they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit 
upon him, and shall kill him; and the third day he shall rise again. 
 
The Request of James and John 
35  ¶ And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, 
saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever 
we shall desire. 
36  And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
 
37  They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy 
right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 
38  But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of 
 
the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am 
 
baptized with? 
 
39  And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall 
indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I 
 
am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 
 
40  but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; 
 
but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. 
41  And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with 
James and John. 
42  But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that 
they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship 
over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 
 
43  But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great 
 
among you, shall be your minister:
