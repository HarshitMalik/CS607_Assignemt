  1073    Ezra 9 
that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening 
 
sacrifice. 
5  And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and 
 
having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and 
spread out my hands unto the Lord my God, 
6  and said, 
¶ O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my 
God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass 
 
is grown up unto the heavens. 
7  Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto 
this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, 
 
been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, 
to captivity, and to a spoil and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
8  And now for a little space grace hath been showed from the Lord 
our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his 
holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little 
reviving in our bondage. 
9  For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our 
 
bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings 
of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and 
to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and 
in Jerusalem. 
10  ¶ And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have 
 
forsaken thy commandments, 
11  which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, 
The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with 
the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, 
which have filled it from one end to another with their 
uncleanness. 
12  Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither 
take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their 
wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, 
 
and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
