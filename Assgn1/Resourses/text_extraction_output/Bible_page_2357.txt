34  Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the 
 
which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named 
Damaris, and others with them.

Paul at Corinth 
1  After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to 
Corinth; 
 
2  and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come 
from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because that Claudius had 
commanded all Jews to depart from Rome,) and came unto them. 
3  And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and 
wrought: (for by their occupation they were tentmakers.) 
 
4  And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded 
the Jews and the Greeks. 
5  ¶ And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul 
was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was 
Christ. 
6  And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his 
raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I 
 
am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 
 
7  And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, 
named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard 
to the synagogue. 
8  And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord 
with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, 
 
and were baptized. 
9  Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, 
but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
 
10  for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I 
 
have much people in this city. 
11  And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of 
God among them.
