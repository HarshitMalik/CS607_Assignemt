  1622    Jeremiah 5 
12  They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil 
 
come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 
   
13  and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: 
 
thus shall it be done unto them. 
14  ¶ Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak 
this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this 
people wood, and it shall devour them. 
15  Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith 
the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation 
 
whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what 
they say. 
16  Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. 
17  And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread, which thy sons 
and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine 
 
herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall 
   
impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the 
sword. 
18  ¶ Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full 
end with you. 
19  And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the 
Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer 
 
them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your 
land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. 
20  ¶ Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
21  Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; 
 
which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:  
   
22  Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my 
   
presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a 
perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves 
 
thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, 
 
yet can they not pass over it? 
 
23  But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are 
 
revolted and gone.
