  1563    Isaiah 40 
21  ¶ Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you 
   
from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations 
 
of the earth? 
 
22  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants 
thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a 
 
curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 
 
23  that bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the 
 
earth as vanity. 
24  Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown; yea, 
   
their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow 
 
upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take 
them away as stubble. 
25  ¶ To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the 
 
Holy One. 
26  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, 
that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by 
 
names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; 
 
not one faileth. 
27  ¶ Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid 
from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God? 
 
28  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting 
 
God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, 
neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. 
 
29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he 
 
increaseth strength. 
30  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall 
utterly fall: 
 
31  but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they 
 
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be 
 
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.
