  469    Deuteronomy 26 
10  And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which 
thou, O Lord, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the 
Lord thy God, and worship before the Lord thy God: 
 
11  and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God 
hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, 
and the stranger that is among you. 
12  ¶ When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine 
increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it 
unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that 
they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;  
 
13  then thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have brought away 
the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them 
unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the 
widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast 
commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, 
 
neither have I forgotten them: 
 
14  I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken 
away aught thereof for any unclean use, nor given aught thereof for 
the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, 
 
and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. 
15  Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy 
people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou 
swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
16  ¶ This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these 
statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them 
 
with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
17  Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk 
in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and 
his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: 
 
18  and the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar 
people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all 
his commandments; 
 
19  and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in 
praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy 
 
people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.
