make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the 
 
sword. 
14  And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people 
Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and 
 
according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the 
 
Lord God. 
The Prophecy against the Philistines 
15  Â¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because the Philistines have dealt by 
 
revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to 
destroy it for the old hatred; 
 
16  therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will stretch out mine 
 
hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethim, and 
destroy the remnant of the seacoast. 
17  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious 
rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay 
 
my vengeance upon them.

Prophecies against Tyrus 
1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the 
month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, 
she is broken that was the gates of the people; she is turned unto 
 
me; I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste: 
   
3  therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O 
 
Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the 
sea causeth his waves to come up. 
4  And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her 
towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the 
 
top of a rock.
