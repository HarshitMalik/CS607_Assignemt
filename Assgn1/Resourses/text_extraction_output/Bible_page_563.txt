  564    Judges 5 
5 
The Song of Deborah and Barak 
1  Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, 
saying, 
2  Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, 
when the people willingly offered themselves. 
3  Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; 
   
I, even I, will sing unto the Lord; 
 
I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel. 
4  Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, 
when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, 
the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, 
the clouds also dropped water. 
5  The mountains melted from before the Lord, 
even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.  
6  In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, 
in the days of Jael, 
the highways were unoccupied, 
and the travelers walked through byways. 
7  The inhabitants of the villages ceased, 
they ceased in Israel, 
until that I Deborah arose, 
that I arose a mother in Israel. 
8  They chose new gods; 
 
then was war in the gates: 
 
was there a shield or spear seen 
among forty thousand in Israel? 
 
9  My heart is toward the governors of Israel, 
that offered themselves willingly among the people. 
Bless ye the Lord. 
10  Speak, ye that ride on white asses, 
ye that sit in judgment, 
and walk by the way.
