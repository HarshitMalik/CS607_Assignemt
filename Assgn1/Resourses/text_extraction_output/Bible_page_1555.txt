  1556    Isaiah 37 
10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy 
God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall 
not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all 
lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? 
   
12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have 
destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of 
Eden which were in Telassar? 
 
13  Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king 
of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? 
 
14  ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the 
messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of 
 
the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. 
15  And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord, saying, 
16  O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubim, 
thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: 
 
thou hast made heaven and earth. 
17  Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and 
 
see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to 
 
reproach the living God. 
18  Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the 
nations, and their countries, 
19  and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the 
 
work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have 
 
destroyed them. 
20  Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all 
the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, even 
thou only. 
21  ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus 
saith the Lord God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me 
against Sennacherib king of Assyria: 
 
22  this is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The 
 
virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee 
to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
