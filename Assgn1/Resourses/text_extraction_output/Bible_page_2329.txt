  2330    Acts 9 
38  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down 
 
both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized 
 
him. 
39  And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the 
Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he 
 
went on his way rejoicing. 
40  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached 
 
in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

The Conversion of Saul 
1  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the 
disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
2  and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he 
found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might 
bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 
3  And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there 
 
shined round about him a light from heaven: 
 
4  and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, 
Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
 
5  And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus 
 
whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
 
6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have 
me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, 
 
and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 
7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing 
a voice, but seeing no man. 
8  And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he 
 
saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into 
 
Damascus. 
9  And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
