  37    Genesis 18 
24  And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
25  And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
26  In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
27  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with 
money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

The Birth of Isaac Promised 
1  And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he 
 
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 
 
2  and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by 
him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent 
 
door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
3  and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not 
away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
 
4  let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest 
yourselves under the tree: 
 
5  and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after 
 
that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your sevant. And 
 
they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
6  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make 
ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes 
upon the hearth. 
7  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and 
good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 
 
8  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, 
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and 
 
they did eat. 
9  Â¶ And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, 
 
Behold, in the tent.
