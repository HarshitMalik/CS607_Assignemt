The Book of Ruth 
[Ruth] 
1 
Ruth and Naomi 
1  Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there 
was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah 
went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his 
two sons. 
2  And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife 
Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, 
Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country 
of Moab, and continued there. 
3  And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her 
 
two sons. 
4  And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the 
 
one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt 
 
there about ten years. 
5  And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman 
 
was left of her two sons and her husband. 
6  ¶ Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return 
from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of 
 
Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them 
bread. 
7  Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her 
two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return 
 
unto the land of Judah. 
8  And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to 
her mother’s house: the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have 
 
dealt with the dead, and with me. 
9  The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house 
of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their 
 
voice, and wept.
