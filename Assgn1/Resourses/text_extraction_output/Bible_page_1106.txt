  1107    Nehemiah 12 
31  ¶ Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and 
appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one 
went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 
 
32  and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
33  and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
34  Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
35  and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah 
 
the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, 
the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: 
 
36  and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, 
Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of 
David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
37  And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went 
up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, 
above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
38  ¶ And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against 
them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, 
from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 
 
39  and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and 
above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of 
Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison 
 
gate. 
40  So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of 
God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
 
41  and the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, 
 
Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
 
42  and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and 
Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers 
sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. 
43  Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had 
 
made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children 
 
rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
