  2179    Luke 8 
8  And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit a 
hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that 
hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
9  ¶ And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 
 
10  And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the 
kingdom of God: but to others in parables; 
   
that seeing they might not see, 
and hearing they might not understand.  
11  Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
 
12  Those by the wayside are they that hear; then cometh the devil, 
 
and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should 
believe and be saved. 
13  They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word 
with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in 
 
time of temptation fall away. 
14  And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have 
heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures 
of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
15  But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good 
heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with 
patience. 
A Light under a Vessel 
16  ¶ No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, 
or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they 
 
which enter in may see the light. 
17  For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any 
 
thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.  
18  Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall 
 
be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even 
 
that which he seemeth to have.
