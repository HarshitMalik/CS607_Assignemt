  106    Genesis 43 
15  And the men took that present, and they took double money in 
their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, 
 
and stood before Joseph. 
16  ¶ And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler 
of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for 
 
these men shall dine with me at noon. 
17  And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men 
 
into Joseph’s house. 
18  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s 
house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in 
 
our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek 
 
occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and 
our asses. 
19  And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they 
communed with him at the door of the house, 
20  and said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
 
21  and it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our 
sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, 
our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our 
 
hand. 
22  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: 
 
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
23  And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of 
 
your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your 
 
money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
24  And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them 
water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses 
 
provender. 
25  And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for 
 
they heard that they should eat bread there. 
26  ¶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present 
which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to 
him to the earth. 
27  And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the 
old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
