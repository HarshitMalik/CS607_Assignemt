When the Guru is totally satisfied and pleased, He colors us with the Lord‟s Love; this 
color shall never fade away.  || 1 ||   O my mind, enshrine love for the Name of the 
Lord. The Guru, satisfied and pleased, taught me about the Lord, and my Sovereign 
Lord King met with me at once.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukh is like the 
ignorant bride, who comes and goes again and again in reincarnation. The Lord God 
does not come into her consciousness, and her mind is stuck in the love of duality.  || 2 
||   I am full of filth, and I practice evil deeds; O Lord, save me, be with me, merge me 
into Your Being! The Guru has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar, and the dirty 
residues of all my sins and mistakes have been washed away.  || 3 ||   O Lord God, 
Merciful  to  the  meek  and  the  poor,  please  unite  me  with  the  Sat  Sangat,  the  True 
Congregation.  Joining  the  Sangat,  servant  Nanak  has  obtained  the  Lord‟s  Love;  my 
mind and body are drenched in it.  || 4 || 3 ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  One who 
chants  the  Name  of  the  Lord,  Har,  Har,  while  constantly  practicing  deception,  shall 
never become pure of heart. He may perform all sorts of rituals, night and day, but he 
shall not find peace, even in dreams.  || 1 ||   O wise ones, without the Guru, there is 
no devotional worship.The untreated cloth does not take up the dye, no matter how 
much everyone may wish it.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   The self-willed manmukh may perform 
chants,  meditations,  austere  self-discipline,  fasts  and  devotional  worship,  but  his 
sickness does not go away. Deep within him is the sickness of excessive egotism; in the 
love of duality he is ruined.  || 2 ||   Outwardly, he wears religious robes and he is very 
clever,  but  his  mind  wanders  in  the  ten  directions.  Engrossed  in  ego,  he  does  not 
remember the Word of the Shabad; over and over again, he is reincarnated.  || 3 ||   O 
Nanak, that mortal who is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace, understands Him; 
that humble servant meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, he 
understands the One Lord, and is absorbed into the One Lord.  || 4 || 4 || 13 ||    
RAAG SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL,  SECOND HOUSE:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I searched and searched the body-village; I found the 
wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.  || 1 ||   The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined 
peace within my mind. The fire of desire was extinguished in an instant, when I met the 
Guru; all my hunger has been satisfied.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Singing the Glorious Praises 
of the Lord, I live, O my mother. The Merciful True Guru implanted the Glorious Praises 
of the Naam within me.  || 2 ||   I search for and seek out my Beloved Lord God, Har, 
Har. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the subtle essence 
of the Lord.  || 3 ||   By the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead, I have 
found  the  Lord.  Guru  Nanak,  pleased  and satisfied, has united me with  the Lord, O 
Siblings of Destiny.  || 4 || 1 || 5 ||   SOOHEE,  FOURTH MEHL:  Showering His Mercy, 
the Lord imbues the mind with His Love. The Gurmukh merges in the Name of the Lord, 
Har, Har.  || 1 ||   Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, the mortal enjoys the pleasure of His 
Love. He remains always blissful, day and night, and he merges into the Shabad, the 
Word of the Perfect Guru.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Everyone longs for the Lord‟s Love; the 
Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of His Love.  || 2 ||   The foolish, self-willed 
manmukh is left pale and uncolored.
