The Invasion of Sennacherib 
1  After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib 
king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped 
against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 
2  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he 
was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 
3  he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the 
waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did 
 
help him. 
4  So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the 
fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, 
saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much 
water? 
 
5  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was 
broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, 
and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields 
in abundance. 
6  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them 
together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake 
comfortably to them, saying, 
7  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king 
of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be 
 
more with us than with him. 
8  With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to 
 
help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves 
upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. 
9  Â¶ After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to 
Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his 
power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah 
that were at Jerusalem, saying, 
10  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that 
ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
