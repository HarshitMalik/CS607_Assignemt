  664    1 Samuel 19 
24  And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake 
David. 
25  And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any 
dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of 
the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the 
hand of the Philistines. 
26  And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David 
well to be the king’s son-in-law: and the days were not expired. 
 
27  Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the 
Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, 
 
and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the 
king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
28  And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and that 
Michal Saul’s daughter loved him. 
29  And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became 
 
David’s enemy continually. 
30  ¶ Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to 
 
pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely 
than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

Saul Seeks to Kill David 
1  And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that 
they should kill David. 
2  But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan 
 
told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now 
 
therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and 
abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
 
3  and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou 
art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, 
 
that I will tell thee. 
4  And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said 
unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;
