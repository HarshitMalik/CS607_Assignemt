  2588    1 Peter 3 
21  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for 
 
us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
 
22  who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  
 
23  who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he 
 
threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth 
 
righteously: 
 
24  who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, 
being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes 
 
ye were healed.  
25  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the 
 
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

The Behavior of Wives and Husbands 
1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if 
 
any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by 
the conversation of the wives; 
 
2  while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. 
3  Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the 
hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;  
 
4  but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not 
corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in 
the sight of God of great price. 
5  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who 
trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their 
own husbands: 
 
6  even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters 
 
ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any 
amazement. 
7  Â¶ Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, 
giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being 
heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not 
 
hindered.
