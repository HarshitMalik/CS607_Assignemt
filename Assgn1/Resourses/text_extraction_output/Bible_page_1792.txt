  1793    Ezekiel 20 
6  in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them 
forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, 
flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:  
 
7  then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of 
his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the 
 
Lord your God. 
8  But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: 
 
they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, 
neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. 
¶ Then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my 
anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
9  But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted 
before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made 
myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of 
Egypt. 
10  Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and 
brought them into the wilderness. 
11  And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, 
which if a man do, he shall even live in them.  
12  Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me 
and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify 
them. 
13  But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they 
 
walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which 
if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they 
 
greatly polluted. 
¶ Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the 
wilderness, to consume them. 
14  But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted 
before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. 
15  Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I 
would not bring them into the land which I had given them, 
flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
