  2032    Matthew 9 
10  ¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, 
many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his 
disciples. 
11  And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why 
eateth your master with publicans and sinners?  
 
12  But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole 
need not a physician, but they that are sick. 
13  But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not 
sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to 
 
repentance. 
The Question about Fasting 
14  ¶ Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and 
the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
 
15  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber 
mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will 
 
come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then 
shall they fast. 
16  No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment; for that 
 
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is 
made worse. 
17  Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles 
 
break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they 
 
put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. 
The Ruler’s Daughter and the Woman Who Touched Jesus’ 
Garment 
18  ¶ While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a 
certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even 
now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. 
 
19  And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
