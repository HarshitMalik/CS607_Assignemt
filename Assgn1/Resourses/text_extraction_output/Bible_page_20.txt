  21    Genesis 9 
5  And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of 
 
every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of 
 
every man’s brother will I require the life of man. 
6  Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for 
 
in the image of God made he man.  
7  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in 
 
the earth, and multiply therein. 
8  ¶ And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
9  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your 
seed after you; 
 
10  and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the 
cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out 
 
of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
11  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be 
 
cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any 
 
more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
12  And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make 
between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for 
perpetual generations: 
 
13  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a 
covenant between me and the earth. 
14  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that 
the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
 
15  and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you 
and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more 
 
become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
16  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I 
 
may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every 
living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 
17  And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I 
have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
