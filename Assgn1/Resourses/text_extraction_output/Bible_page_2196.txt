  2197    Luke 12 
Whom to Fear 
4  ¶ And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the 
body, and after that have no more that they can do. 
5  But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after 
 
he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear 
 
him. 
6  Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is 
forgotten before God? 
 
7  But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not 
therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
 
Confessing Christ before Men 
8  ¶ Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him 
shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 
 
9  but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels 
of God. 
10  And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall 
be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy 
 
Ghost it shall not be forgiven.  
11  And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto 
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye 
shall answer, or what ye shall say: 
 
12  for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought 
to say.  
The Parable of the Rich Fool 
13  ¶ And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my 
brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 
14  And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over 
you?
