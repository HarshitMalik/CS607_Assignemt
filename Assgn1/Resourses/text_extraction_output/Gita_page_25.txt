GITA DHYANAM
6. With Kesava as the helmsman, verily was crossed by the Pandavas the battle-river, whose
banks were Bhishma and Drona, whose water was Jayadratha, whose blue lotus was the king of
Gandhara, whose crocodile was Salya, whose current was Kripa, whose billow was Karna, whose
terrible alligators were Vikarna and Asvatthama, whose whirlpool was Duryodhana.
Paaraasharya vachah sarojamamalam geetaarthagandhotkatam;
Naanaakhyaanakakesaram harikathaa sambodhanaabodhitam;
Loke sajjana shatpadairaharahah pepeeyamaanam mudaa;
Bhooyaadbhaaratapankajam kalimala pradhwamsinah shreyase.
7. May this lotus of the Mahabharata, born in the lake of the words of Vyasa, sweet with the
fragrance of the meaning of the Gita, with many stories as its stamens, fully opened by the
discourses of Hari, the destroyer of the sins of Kali, and drunk joyously by the bees of good men in
the world, become day by day the bestower of good to us!
Mookam karoti vaachaalam pangum langhayate girim;
Yatkripaa tamaham vande paramaanandamaadhavam.
8. I salute that Madhava, the source of supreme bliss, whose Grace makes the dumb
eloquent and the cripple cross mountains!
Yam brahmaa varunendrarudramarutah stunwanti divyaih stavaih,
Vedaih saangapadakramopanishadair gaayanti yam saamagaah,
Dhyaanaavasthitatadgatena manasaa pashyanti yam yogino,
Yasyaantam na viduh suraasuraganaa devaaya tasmai namah.
9. Salutations to that God whom Brahma, Indra, Varuna, Rudra and the Maruts praise with
divine hymns, of whom the Sama-chanters sing by the Vedas and their Angas (in the Pada and
Krama methods), and by the Upanishads; whom the Yogis see with their minds absorbed in Him
through meditation, and whose ends the hosts of Devas and Asuras know not!
