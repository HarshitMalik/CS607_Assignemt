allowing  dullness.  You  can  see  the  results  in  one  or  two
days.”
The compass and the ruler are models of the round and
the square. The level and the plumb line are models of the
even and the straight. People who have compass and ruler
on  their  left  and  level  and  plumb  line  on  their  right  are
models of humanity.
The ruler and compass, level and plumb line, are order;
order is based on respect. If a country has no order, rebels
and robbers rise and ruin the nation. If one’s body has no
order,  then  emotions  and  desires  overcome  and  ruin  the
body.
SELF-GOVERNMENT
A sage said, “In learning, you increase daily; for the Way,
you  decrease  daily.”  This  “decrease”  means  decreasing
excess to attain centered balance, decreasing trivialities to
return  to  basics,  and  reducing  human  desires  to  return  to
celestial design.
There  may  be  a  hundred  human  desires,  but  it  is
imperative  to  master  oneself  first.  Mastering  your  self  is
like overcoming an enemy; first you must know where the
enemy is before you can send in your troops.
Self-government should be strict, like a farmer weeding,
who must remove weeds by the roots before he can be free
of concern that they will grow back.
