  1229    Psalms 25 
25 
A Prayer for Guidance, Pardon and Protection 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
2  O my God, I trust in thee: 
 
let me not be ashamed, 
let not mine enemies triumph over me. 
3  Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: 
 
let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. 
4  Show me thy ways, O Lord; 
 
teach me thy paths. 
5  Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: 
 
for thou art the God of my salvation; 
 
on thee do I wait all the day. 
6  Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving-
kindnesses; 
 
for they have been ever of old. 
7  Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: 
 
according to thy mercy remember thou me 
for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord. 
8  Good and upright is the Lord: 
 
therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 
9  The meek will he guide in judgment: 
 
and the meek will he teach his way. 
10  All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth 
unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
11  For thy name’s sake, O Lord, 
pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. 
 
12  What man is he that feareth the Lord? 
 
Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. 
13  His soul shall dwell at ease; 
 
and his seed shall inherit the earth.
