  617    Ruth 4 
11  And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou 
 
requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a 
 
virtuous woman. 
12  And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a 
 
kinsman nearer than I. 
13  Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will 
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the 
 
kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, 
 
then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth: lie 
 
down until the morning. 
14  ¶ And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before 
 
one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a 
woman came into the floor. 
15  Also he said, Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. 
And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it 
on her: and she went into the city. 
 
16  And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, 
my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. 
 
17  And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to 
 
me, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law. 
18  Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the 
matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have 
 
finished the thing this day.

Boaz Marries Ruth 
1  Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, 
 
behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he 
 
said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned 
 
aside, and sat down. 
2  And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down 
here. And they sat down.
