THE YOGA OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD & THE KNOWER OF THE FIELD
even in the midst of life. When we perceive this supreme Presence dwelling in all beings we cannot
injure anyone. Krishna asks us to see and know the difference between the Field (body or Prakriti)
and the Knower of the Field (Spirit or Purusha), and thus reach the Self. This is the teaching and the
message of this illuminating discourse.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Prakritim purusham chaiva kshetram kshetrajnameva cha;
Etadveditumicchaami jnaanam jneyam cha keshava.
Arjuna said:
1. I wish to learn about Nature (matter) and the Spirit (soul), the Field and the Knower of the
Field, knowledge and that which ought to be known.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Idam shareeram kaunteya kshetramityabhidheeyate;
Etadyo vetti tam praahuh kshetrajna iti tadvidah.
The Blessed Lord said:
2. This body, O Arjuna, is called the Field; he who knows it is called the Knower of the Field
by those who know of them, that is, by the sages.
Kshetrajnam chaapi maam viddhi sarvakshetreshu bhaarata;
Kshetrakshetrajnayor jnaanam yattat jnaanam matam mama.
3. Do thou also know Me as the Knower of the Field in all fields, O Arjuna! Knowledge of
both the Field and the Knower of the Field is considered by Me to be the knowledge.
Tat kshetram yaccha yaadrik cha yadvikaari yatashcha yat;
Sa cha yo yatprabhaavashcha tatsamaasena me shrinu.
4. What the Field is and of what nature, what its modifications are and whence it is, and also
who He is and what His powers areâ€”hear all that from Me in brief.
Rishibhirbahudhaa geetam cchandobhirvividhaih prithak;
Brahmasootrapadaishchaiva hetumadbhirvinishchitaih.
5. Sages have sung in many ways, in various distinctive chants and also in the suggestive
words indicative of the Absolute, full of reasoning and decisive.
Mahaabhootaanyahankaaro buddhiravyaktameva cha;
Indriyaani dashaikam cha pancha chendriyagocharaah.
