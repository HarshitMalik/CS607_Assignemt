  2648    Revelation 20 
6  Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on 
 
such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of 
God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 
7  ¶ And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed 
out of his prison, 
8  and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four 
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to 
battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 
 
9  And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the 
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down 
 
from God out of heaven, and devoured them. 
10  And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and 
brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be 
tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
The Judgment at the Great White Throne 
11  ¶ And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from 
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was 
 
found no place for them. 
12  And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the 
 
books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the 
 
book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which 
 
were written in the books, according to their works.  
13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell 
 
delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged 
 
every man according to their works. 
14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second 
death. 
15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast 
into the lake of fire.
