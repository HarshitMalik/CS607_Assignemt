  509    Joshua 8 
19  And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the 
Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me 
 
now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. 
 
20  And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned 
against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 
 
21  When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and 
two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels 
weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are 
 
hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. 
22  Â¶ So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, 
 
behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 
23  And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them 
unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out 
before the Lord. 
24  And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, 
and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his 
sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, 
and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the 
 
valley of Achor. 
25  And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall 
 
trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and 
burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
26  And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So 
the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the 
name of that place was called, The valley of Achor [trouble], unto 
this day.

The Capture and Destruction of Ai 
1  And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou 
dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to 
 
Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, 
 
and his city, and his land:
