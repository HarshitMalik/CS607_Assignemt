  1779    Ezekiel 15 
15  If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, 
so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the 
beasts: 
 
16  though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, they 
shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be 
 
delivered, but the land shall be desolate. 
17  Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the 
land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 
   
18  though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, 
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be 
delivered themselves. 
19  Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon 
it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 
 
20  though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord 
God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but 
 
deliver their own souls by their righteousness. 
21  Â¶ For thus saith the Lord God; How much more when I send my 
 
four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, 
and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man 
and beast? 
 
22  Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought 
forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto 
 
you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be 
 
comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, 
even concerning all that I have brought upon it. 
23  And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their 
doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all 
 
that I have done in it, saith the Lord God.

Jerusalem like a Useless Vine
