  86    Genesis 36 
The Death of Isaac 
27  ¶ And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city 
of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.  
28  And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. 
29  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his 
people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob 
 
buried him. 
36 
The Descendants of Esau 
1  Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 
2  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter 
 
of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the 
daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
 
3  and Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.  
4  And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz, and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
 
5  and Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the 
 
sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 
6  ¶ And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all 
the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his 
substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into 
 
the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
7  For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; 
 
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them 
because of their cattle. 
8  Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 
 
9  ¶ And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites 
in mount Seir: 
 
10  these are the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife 
 
of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 
11  And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, 
and Kenaz.
