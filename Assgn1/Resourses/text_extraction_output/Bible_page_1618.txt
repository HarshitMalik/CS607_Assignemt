  1619    Jeremiah 4 
9  ¶ And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the Lord, that the 
heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the 
 
priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. 
10  Then said I, Ah, Lord God! surely thou hast greatly deceived this 
 
people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the 
 
sword reacheth unto the soul. 
11  ¶ At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry 
wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of 
my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, 
12  even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will 
 
I give sentence against them. 
13  Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a 
whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we 
   
are spoiled. 
14  O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest 
be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? 
 
15  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from 
mount Ephraim. 
16  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against 
 
Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out 
their voice against the cities of Judah. 
17  As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she 
 
hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord. 
18  Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is 
 
thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine 
heart. 
19  ¶ My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart 
   
maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast 
 
heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
20  Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is 
 
spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a 
 
moment. 
21  How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the 
trumpet?
