  902    2 Kings 25 
26  And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the 
armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the 
 
Chaldees. 
Jehoiachin Released and Honored in Babylon 
27  Â¶ And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity 
of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven 
and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of 
Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of 
Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 
 
28  and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of 
the kings that were with him in Babylon; 
 
29  and changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually 
 
before him all the days of his life. 
30  And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, 
a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.
