but especially among my neighbors, 
and a fear to mine acquaintance: 
 
they that did see me without fled from me. 
12  I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: 
 
I am like a broken vessel.

and let them be silent in the grave. 
18  Let the lying lips be put to silence; 
 
which speak grievous things 
proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; 
 
which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee 
before the sons of men!

from the pride of man: 
 
thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion 
from the strife of tongues. 
21  Blessed be the Lord: 
 
for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong city. 
22  For I said in my haste, 
I am cut off from before thine eyes:
