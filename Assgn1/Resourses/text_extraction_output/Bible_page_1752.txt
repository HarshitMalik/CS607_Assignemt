[Ezekiel] 
1 
The Prophet’s Vision of the Divine Glory 
1  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the 
fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of 
Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 
2  In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king 
Jehoiachin’s captivity,  
3  the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the 
son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and 
 
the hand of the Lord was there upon him. 
4  ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a 
great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, 
and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst 
of the fire. 
5  Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living 
creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a 
 
man. 
6  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 
7  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like 
 
the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the color of 
 
burnished brass. 
8  And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four 
sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 
 
9  Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they 
 
went; they went every one straight forward. 
 
10  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, 
and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face 
 
of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
