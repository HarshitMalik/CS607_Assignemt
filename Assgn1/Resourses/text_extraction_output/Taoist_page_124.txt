Unconcern  is  true  stability,  concern  is  response  to
events.  It  is  like  a  mirror,  which  reflects  the  forms  of
anyone or anything that happens to be there.
With  skillful  application  of  expedient  techniques,  as
long  as  you  are  able  to  gain  access  to  stabilization  and
unleash insight, whether it comes sooner or later is not up
to  the  person.  Do  not  hastily  seek  insight  within
stabilization, for if you seek insight that will damage your
stability,  and  if  you  damage  stability  you  will  have  no
insight.
If insight occurs spontaneously without your seeking for
insight,  then  that  is  true  insight.  To  be  insightful  without
exploiting it is true wisdom appearing ignorant, enhancing
the twin beauties of stability and insight without end.
If you think when in a stabilized state, you will be very
sensitive and all sorts of devils and sprites will follow your
mind  and  appear  accordingly.  The  wondrous  and  weird
phenomena encountered by the realized people and the old
masters are evidence of this.
Just  let  there  be  uncovered  openness  above  the
stabilized  mind  and  groundless  vastness  below  the
stabilized  mind.  Old  habits  dissolve,  new  habits  are  not
created; not bound or obstructed by anything, you get out
of the net of the world.
Practice this for a long time and you will naturally attain
the Way.
In people who attain the Way there are five mental times
and seven physical phases.
