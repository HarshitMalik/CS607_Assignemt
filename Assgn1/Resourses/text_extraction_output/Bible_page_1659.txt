  1660    Jeremiah 23 
27  But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they 
not return. 
28  Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is 
 
no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are 
 
cast into a land which they know not? 
 
29  O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord. 
30  Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall 
not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting 
 
upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. 
23 
The Return of the Remnant 
1  Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my 
pasture! saith the Lord. 
 
2  Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that 
feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, 
 
and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of 
 
your doings, saith the Lord. 
3  And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries 
whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their 
folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. 
 
4  And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and 
 
they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be 
lacking, saith the Lord. 
5  ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto 
David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and 
shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. 
6  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and 
 
this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our 
Righteousness.  
7  ¶ Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall 
no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought up the children of 
Israel out of the land of Egypt;
