  1806    Ezekiel 24 
45  And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of 
adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; 
 
because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
46  ¶ For thus saith the Lord God; I will bring up a company upon 
 
them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled. 
47  And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them 
with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, 
 
and burn up their houses with fire. 
48  Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women 
may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 
49  And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall 
bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord 
 
God.

The Parable of the Boiling Pot 
1  Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the 
month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: 
 
the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. 
3  And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, 
Thus saith the Lord God; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour 
 
water into it: 
 
4  gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, 
and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. 
 
5  Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and 
make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. 
6  ¶ Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the bloody city, to 
 
the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of 
it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. 
   
7  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a 
 
rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
