  1600    Isaiah 61 
19  ¶ The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness 
 
shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto 
 
thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.  
20  Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw 
 
itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of 
 
thy mourning shall be ended. 
21  Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for 
 
ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may 
be glorified. 
22  A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong 
nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.

Good Tidings of Salvation to Zion 
1  The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath 
 
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent 
 
me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the 
captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 
 
2  to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of 
vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;  
   
3  to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them 
beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise 
for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called Trees of 
 
righteousness, The planting of the Lord, that he might be 
glorified. 
4  And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former 
desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of 
many generations. 
5  ¶ And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the 
alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
6  But ye shall be named The priests of the Lord: men shall call you 
 
The ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, 
 
and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
