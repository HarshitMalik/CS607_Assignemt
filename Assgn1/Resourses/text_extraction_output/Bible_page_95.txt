Joseph Interprets the Prisoners’ Dreams 
1  And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of 
Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 
2  And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief 
of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 
3  And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, 
into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
4  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he 
served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
 
5  And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in

his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly today? 
 
8  And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no 
interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations 
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. 
 
9  ¶ And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In

10  and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, 
 
and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth 
 
ripe grapes: 
 
11  and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and 
 
pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s 
hand. 
12  And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three 
 
branches are three days:
