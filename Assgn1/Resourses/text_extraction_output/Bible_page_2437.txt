  2438    1 Corinthians 9 
7  Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a 
 
vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a 
 
flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
 
8  ¶ Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
   
9  For it is written in the law of Moses, 
Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox 
that treadeth out the corn.  
Doth God take care for oxen? 
 
10  or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this 
 
is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he 
   
that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
11  If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we 
shall reap your carnal things?  
 
12  If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? 
 
¶ Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, 
 
lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
13  Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of 
the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are 
 
partakers with the altar? 
 
14  Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel 
should live of the gospel.  
15  ¶ But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these 
 
things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me 
 
to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 
16  For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for 
 
necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the 
 
gospel! 
 
17  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my 
 
will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. 
18  What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I 
 
may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my 
power in the gospel. 
19  ¶ For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant 
unto all, that I might gain the more.
