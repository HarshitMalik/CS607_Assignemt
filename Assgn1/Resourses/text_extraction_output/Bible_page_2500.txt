  2501    Philippians 1 
To Me to Live Is Christ 
12  ¶ But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which 
happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the 
gospel; 
 
13  so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all 
other places; 
 
14  and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my 
bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
15  ¶ Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also 
 
of good will: 
 
16  the one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to 
add affliction to my bonds: 
 
17  but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the 
gospel. 
18  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or 
 
in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will 
 
rejoice. 
19  ¶ For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your 
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
20  according to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I 
shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also 
Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by 
death. 
21  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
22  But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall 
 
choose I wot not. 
23  For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be 
with Christ; which is far better: 
   
24  nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. 
25  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue 
with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
 
26  that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by 
my coming to you again.
