eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe 
 
themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their 
abominations. 
10  And they shall know that I am the Lord, and that I have not said in 
vain that I would do this evil unto them. 
11  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with 
 
thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of 
Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the 
 
pestilence. 
12  He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall 
 
fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by 
 
the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. 
 
13  Then shall ye know that I am the Lord, when their slain men shall 
be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, 
in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and 
under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savor to 
all their idols. 
14  So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land 
desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in 
all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

The End Is Come 
1  Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God unto the land of 
Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 
 
3  Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon 
thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will 
recompense upon thee all thine abominations. 
4  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I 
 
will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall 
be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
 
5  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
