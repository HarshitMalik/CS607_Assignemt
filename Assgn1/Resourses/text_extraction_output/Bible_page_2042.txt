  2043    Matthew 12 
40  for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so 
 
shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of 
the earth. 
41  The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, 
and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of 
 
Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here. 
 
42  The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this 
generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost 
 
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a 
 
greater than Solomon is here. 
The Return of the Unclean Spirit 
43  ¶ When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh 
through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 
44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; 
 
and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 
45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the 
 
last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also 
unto this wicked generation. 
Jesus’ Mother and Brethren 
46  ¶ While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his 
brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. 
47  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren 
stand without, desiring to speak with thee. 
48  But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my 
mother? and who are my brethren? 
   
49  And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, 
Behold my mother and my brethren! 
 
50  For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, 
the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
