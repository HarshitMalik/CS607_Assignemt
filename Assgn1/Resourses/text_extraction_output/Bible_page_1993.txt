oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen 
 
with mine eyes. 
Zion’s Future King 
9  ¶ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of 
 
Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and 
   
having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the 
 
foal of an ass.  
10  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from 
Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak 
 
peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to 
 
sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.  
11  ¶ As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy 
prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. 
12  Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I 
 
declare that I will render double unto thee; 
 
13  when I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and 
raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made 
thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
14  ¶ And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go 
forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, 
 
and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. 
15  The Lord of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and 
 
subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as 
 
through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners 
 
of the altar. 
16  ¶ And the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock 
of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as 
 
an ensign upon his land. 
17  For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn 
 
shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
