  1577    Isaiah 47 
13  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my 
 
salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel 
 
my glory.

Judgment on Babylon 
1  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit 
on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for 
   
thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. 
2  Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare 
 
the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. 
3  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I 
 
will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man. 
4  As for our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One 
of Israel. 
5  ¶ Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the 
Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. 
 
6  I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and 
given them into thine hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon 
   
the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. 
7  And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay 
 
these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of 
it. 
8  ¶ Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that 
dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else 
besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss 
 
of children: 
 
9  but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the 
loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in 
 
their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great 
abundance of thine enchantments.
