  1958    Micah 6 
8  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst 
of many people, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young 
lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both 
 
treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 
9  Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine 
enemies shall be cut off. 
10  ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will 
cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy 
chariots: 
 
11  and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy 
strongholds: 
 
12  and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have 
 
no more soothsayers: 
 
13  thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of 
the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of 
 
thine hands. 
14  And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I 
 
destroy thy cities. 
15  And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, 
such as they have not heard.

The Lord’s Controversy with Israel 
1  Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the 
 
mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 
2  Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord’s controversy, and ye strong 
foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his 
 
people, and he will plead with Israel. 
3  ¶ O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I 
 
wearied thee? testify against me. 
 
4  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee 
out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, 
 
and Miriam.
