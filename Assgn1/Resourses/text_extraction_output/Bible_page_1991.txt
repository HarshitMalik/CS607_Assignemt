were in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of 
hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. 
10  For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for 
beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in 
 
because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his 
 
neighbor. 
11  But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the 
former days, saith the Lord of hosts. 
12  For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and 
 
the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their 
dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these 
 
things. 
13  And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the 
heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, 
 
and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. 
 
14  ¶ For thus saith the Lord of hosts; As I thought to punish you, 
 
when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord of hosts, 
and I repented not: 
 
15  so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and 
to the house of Judah: fear ye not. 
 
16  These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth 
 
to his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your 
 
gates: 
 
17  and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his 
neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, 
   
saith the Lord. 
18  ¶ And the word of the Lord of hosts came unto me, saying, 
19  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the 
 
fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the 
tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful 
feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 
 
20  ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there 
 
shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:
