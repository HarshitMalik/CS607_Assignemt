The Oracle concerning Tyre 
1  The burden of Tyre.  
¶ Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no 
 
house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to 
 
them. 
2  Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of 
 
Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth. 
10  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no 
 
more strength. 
11  He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the 
 
Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to 
destroy the strongholds thereof. 
12  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, 
daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou 
   
have no rest. 
13  ¶ Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the 
 
Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set
