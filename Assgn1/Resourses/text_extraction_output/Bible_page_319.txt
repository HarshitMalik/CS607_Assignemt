The Priestly Benediction 
22  Â¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
23  Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall 
bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
24  The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: 
 
25  the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto 
thee: 
 
26  the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. 
27  And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will 
bless them.

Offerings for the Dedication of the Altar 
1  And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the 
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the 
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and 
had anointed them, and sanctified them; 
 
2  that the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who 
were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were 
numbered, offered: 
 
3  and they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered 
wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for 
 
each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 
 
4  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
5  Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle 
of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to 
 
every man according to his service. 
6  And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the 
Levites.
