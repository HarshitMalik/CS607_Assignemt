  2066    Matthew 20 
18  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be 
 
betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall 
condemn him to death, 
19  and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and 
to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. 
 
The Request of James and John 
20  ¶ Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her 
sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. 
21  And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant 
 
that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the 
other on the left, in thy kingdom. 
22  But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able 
to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the 
baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. 
 
23  And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be 
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my 
 
right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to 
them for whom it is prepared of my Father. 
24  And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation 
against the two brethren. 
25  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes 
of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are 
great exercise authority upon them. 
26  But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great 
 
among you, let him be your minister; 
 
27  and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:  
 
28  even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to 
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

29  ¶ And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed 
him.
