  1529    Isaiah 22 
Shebna to Be Replaced by Eliakim 
15  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Go, get thee unto this 
treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say, 
16  What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast 
hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a 
sepulchre on high, and that graveth a habitation for himself in a 
rock? 
 
17  Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and 
will surely cover thee. 
18  He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large 
country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory 
 
shall be the shame of thy lord’s house. 
19  And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he 
pull thee down. 
20  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant 
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
 
21  and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy 
girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he 
 
shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of 
Judah. 
22  And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so 
 
he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none 
 
shall open.  
23  And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a 
 
glorious throne to his father’s house. 
24  And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, 
the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the 
vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. 
25  In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in 
the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the 
 
burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the Lord hath spoken 
 
it.
