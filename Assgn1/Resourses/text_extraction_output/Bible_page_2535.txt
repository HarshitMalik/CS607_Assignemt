  2536    1 Timothy 6 
12  Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto 
thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before 
many witnesses. 
13  I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, 
and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good 
confession;  
 
14  that thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, 
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
 
15  which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only 
Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 
 
16  who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man 
can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom 
   
be honor and power everlasting. Amen. 
17  ¶ Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-
minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who 
giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 
 
18  that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to 
distribute, willing to communicate; 
 
19  laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the 
time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 
20  ¶ O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding 
profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so 
called: 
 
21  which some professing have erred concerning the faith. 
¶ Grace be with thee. Amen.
