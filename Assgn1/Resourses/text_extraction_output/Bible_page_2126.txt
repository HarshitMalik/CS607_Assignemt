  2127    Mark 10 
18  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none 
 
good but one, that is, God. 
19  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do 
not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, 
Honor thy father and mother.  
20  And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I 
observed from my youth. 
21  Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing 
thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the 
 
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the 
 
cross, and follow me. 
22  And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had 
 
great possessions. 
23  ¶ And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How 
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
 
24  And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth 
again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that 
trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
 
25  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a 
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
26  And they were astonished out of measure, saying among 
themselves, Who then can be saved? 
 
27  And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but 
not with God: for with God all things are possible. 
 
28  Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have 
followed thee. 
29  And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no 
man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or 
mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s, 
30  but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and 
brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with 
persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. 
 
31  But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
