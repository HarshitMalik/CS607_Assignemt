  1236    Psalms 31 
31 
A Profession of Trust 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; 
 
let me never be ashamed: 
 
deliver me in thy righteousness. 
2  Bow down thine ear to me; 
 
deliver me speedily: 
 
be thou my strong rock, 
for a house of defense to save me. 
3  For thou art my rock and my fortress; 
 
therefore for thy nameâ€™s sake lead me, and guide me. 
4  Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: 
 
for thou art my strength. 
5  Into thine hand I commit my spirit:  
 
thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. 
6  I have hated them that regard lying vanities: 
 
but I trust in the Lord. 
7  I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: 
 
for thou hast considered my trouble; 
 
thou hast known my soul in adversities; 
 
8  and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: 
 
thou hast set my feet in a large room. 
9  Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: 
 
mine eye is consumed with grief, 
yea, my soul and my belly. 
10  For my life is spent with grief, 
and my years with sighing: 
 
my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, 
and my bones are consumed. 
11  I was a reproach among all mine enemies,
