  1616    Jeremiah 3 
in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy 
 
whoredoms and with thy wickedness. 
3  Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been

thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine 
 
anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will 
 
not keep anger for ever. 
13  Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
