The Land Yet to Be Possessed 
1  Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the Lord said unto 
 
him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet 
very much land to be possessed. 
2  This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the 
 
Philistines, and all Geshuri, 
3  from Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron 
northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the 
 
Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, 
 
the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: 
   
4  from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is 
beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites: 
 
5  and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon toward the sunrising, 
from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into 
Hamath. 
6  All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto 
Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out 
from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto 
 
the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. 
7  Â¶ Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine 
tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 
8  with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their 
inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even 
as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them;
