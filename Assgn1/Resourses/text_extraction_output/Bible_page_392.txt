  393    Numbers 32 
5  wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this 
land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not 
over Jordan. 
6  ¶ And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of 
Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 
 
7  And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel 
from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them? 
 
8  Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see 
the land. 
9  For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, 
they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they 
should not go into the land which the Lord had given them.  
10  And the Lord’s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, 
saying, 
11  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty 
years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto 
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not 
 
wholly followed me: 
 
12  save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son 
of Nun; for they have wholly followed the Lord. 
 
13  And the Lord’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made 
them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, 
that had done evil in the sight of the Lord, was consumed.  
14  And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of 
sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward 
Israel. 
15  For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in 
the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. 
 
16  ¶ And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds 
here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 
 
17  but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, 
until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones 
 
shall dwell in the fenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the 
land.
