  2237    Luke 23 
41  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: 
   
but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
42  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into 
thy kingdom. 
43  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be 
with me in paradise. 
44  ¶ And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all 
the earth until the ninth hour. 
45  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in 
the midst. 
46  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into 
thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up 
 
the ghost. 
47  Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, 
saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
48  And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the 
things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
49  And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from 
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. 
The Burial of Jesus 
50  ¶ And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he 
 
was a good man, and a just: 
 
51  (the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them:) he 
 
was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews; who also himself waited for 
 
the kingdom of God. 
52  This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
53  And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a 
sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was 
laid. 
54  And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
55  And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed 
after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
