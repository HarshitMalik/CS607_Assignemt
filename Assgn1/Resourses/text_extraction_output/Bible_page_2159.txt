  2160    Luke 3 
make his paths straight. 
5  Every valley shall be filled, 
and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; 
 
and the crooked shall be made straight, 
and the rough ways shall be made smooth; 
 
6  and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.  
7  ¶ Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of 
him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the 
wrath to come? 
 
8  Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to 
say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say 
 
unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto 
Abraham. 
9  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree 
 
therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and 
cast into the fire.

11  He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him 
impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do 
 
likewise. 
12  Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, 
Master, what shall we do? 
 
13  And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is 
appointed you. 
14  And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall 
we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither 
 
accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. 
 
15  ¶ And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in 
their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 
 
16  John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with 
water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I 
 
am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy 
 
Ghost and with fire:
