  1294    Psalms 72 
18  Now also when I am old and grayheaded, 
O God, forsake me not; 
 
until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, 
and thy power to every one that is to come. 
19  Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, 
who hast done great things: 
 
O God, who is like unto thee! 
 
20  Thou, which hast showed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken 
me again, 
and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. 
21  Thou shalt increase my greatness, 
and comfort me on every side. 
22  I will also praise thee with the psaltery, 
even thy truth, O my God: 
 
unto thee will I sing with the harp, 
O thou Holy One of Israel. 
23  My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; 
 
and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. 
24  My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: 
 
for they are confounded, 
for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

The Reign of the Righteous King 
A Psalm for Solomon. 
1  Give the king thy judgments, O God, 
and thy righteousness unto the kingâ€™s son. 
2  He shall judge thy people with righteousness, 
and thy poor with judgment. 
3  The mountains shall bring peace to the people, 
and the little hills, by righteousness. 
4  He shall judge the poor of the people,
