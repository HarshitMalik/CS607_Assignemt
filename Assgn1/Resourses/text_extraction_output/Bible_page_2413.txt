  2414    Romans 12 
32  For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have 
mercy upon all. 
33  ¶ O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of 
God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past 
 
finding out! 
 
34  For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his 
 
counselor?  
 
35  or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto 
him again?  
 
36  For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom 
 
be glory for ever. Amen.

Exhortations for Christian Living 
1  I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye 
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, 
which is your reasonable service. 
2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the 
 
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and 
acceptable, and perfect will of God. 
3  ¶ For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is 
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to 
think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every 
 
man the measure of faith. 
4  For as we have many members in one body, and all members have 
not the same office: 
 
5  so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members 
one of another. 
6  Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, 
whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of 
faith; 
 
7  or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on 
 
teaching;
