  1432    Proverbs 17 
and leadeth him into the way that is not good. 
30  He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: 
 
moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. 
31  The hoary head is a crown of glory, 
if it be found in the way of righteousness. 
32  He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; 
 
and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 
33  The lot is cast into the lap; 
 
but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.

1  Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, 
than a house full of sacrifices with strife. 
2  A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, 
and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. 
3  The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: 
 
but the Lord trieth the hearts. 
4  A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; 
 
and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. 
5  Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: 
 
and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. 
6  Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; 
 
and the glory of children are their fathers. 
7  Excellent speech becometh not a fool: 
 
much less do lying lips a prince. 
8  A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: 
 
whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 
9  He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; 
 
but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. 
10  A reproof entereth more into a wise man 
than a hundred stripes into a fool. 
11  An evil man seeketh only rebellion: 
 
therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 
12  Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
