of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of 
the Jews. 
12  ¶ And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of 
Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many 
 
were gathered together praying. 
13  And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to 
hearken, named Rhoda. 
14  And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for 
gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. 
15  And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed 
that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. 
16  But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, 
 
and saw him, they were astonished. 
17  But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, 
declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the 
prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the 
brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

soldiers, what was become of Peter.

examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to 
death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and there abode.

but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus 
the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their 
 
country was nourished by the king’s country. 
21  And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his 
throne, and made an oration unto them. 
22  And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not 
of a man.
