  1819    Ezekiel 30 
16  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which 
bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after 
them: but they shall know that I am the Lord God. 
 
17  ¶ And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first 
month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came 
unto me, saying, 
18  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to 
serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and 
 
every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for 
 
Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 
 
19  therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will give the land of 
 
Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her 
 
multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the 
 
wages for his army. 
20  I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor wherewith he 
served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord God. 
21  ¶ In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud 
forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of 
them; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
 
30 
1  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye, 
 
Woe worth the day! 
 
3  For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is near, a cloudy day; 
 
it shall be the time of the heathen. 
4  And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in 
Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take 
away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. 
5  Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and 
Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them 
by the sword.
