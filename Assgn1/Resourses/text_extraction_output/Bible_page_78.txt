  79    Genesis 32 
Jacob Wrestles at Peniel 
22  ¶ And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two 
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford 
Jabbok. 
23  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over 
that he had. 
24  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until 
 
the breaking of the day. 
25  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the 
hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of 
 
joint, as he wrestled with him. 
26  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not 
let thee go, except thou bless me. 
27  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
 
28  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for 
 
as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast 
prevailed. 
29  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And 
he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he 
 
blessed him there. 
30  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel [the face of God]: for 
 
I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 
31  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted 
upon his thigh. 
32  Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, 
which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he 
 
touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.
