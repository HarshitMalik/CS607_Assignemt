  331    Numbers 10 
journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was 
 
taken up, they journeyed. 
22  Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud 
tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of 
Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was 
 
taken up, they journeyed. 
23  At the commandment of the Lord they rested in their tents, and at 
the commandment of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the 
 
charge of the Lord, at the commandment of the Lord by the hand 
of Moses. 
10 
The Silver Trumpets 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make 
 
them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, 
 
and for the journeying of the camps. 
3  And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall 
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
4  And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are 
heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. 
5  When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts 
shall go forward. 
6  When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on 
the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for 
 
their journeys. 
7  But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, 
but ye shall not sound an alarm. 
8  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; 
 
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your 
generations.
