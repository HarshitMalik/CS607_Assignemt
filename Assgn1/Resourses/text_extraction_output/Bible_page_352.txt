  353    Numbers 18 
7  And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of 
witness. 
8  ¶ And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the 
tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house 
 
of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed 
blossoms, and yielded almonds. 
9  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all 
the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. 
 
10  And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the 
testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt 
 
quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. 
11  And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he. 
 
12  ¶ And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we 
die, we perish, we all perish. 
13  Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the Lord 
shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

Provision for the Priests and Levites 
1  And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s 
house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou 
 
and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
2  And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, 
bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and 
minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister 
 
before the tabernacle of witness. 
3  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: 
 
only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the 
altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 
4  And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the 
tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: 
 
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
