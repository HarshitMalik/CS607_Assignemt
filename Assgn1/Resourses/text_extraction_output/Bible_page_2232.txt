  2233    Luke 22 
55  And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were 
set down together, Peter sat down among them. 
56  But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly 
looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
57  And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
58  And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of 
them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
59  And about the space of one hour after another confidently 
affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him; for he is a 
 
Galilean. 
60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And 
immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter 
remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, 
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
62  And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. 
Jesus Mocked and Beaten 
63  ¶ And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. 
64  And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, 
and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
 
65  And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. 
Jesus before the Council 
66  ¶ And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief 
priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their 
council, saying, 
67  Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye 
 
will not believe: 
 
68  and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. 
69  Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of 
God.
