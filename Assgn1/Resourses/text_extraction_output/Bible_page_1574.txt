  1575    Isaiah 45 
make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and 
 
there is none else, there is no God. 
15  Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the 
Saviour. 
16  They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall 
 
go to confusion together that are makers of idols. 
17  But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: 
 
ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 
18  ¶ For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself 
 
that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he 
 
created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, 
 
and there is none else. 
19  I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not 
 
unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the Lord speak 
 
righteousness, I declare things that are right.

20  ¶ Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are 
 
escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the 
 
wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save. 
21  Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: 
   
who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from 
 
that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me; 
     
a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. 
 
22  ¶ Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am 
 
God, and there is none else. 
23  I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in 
righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall 
bow, every tongue shall swear.  
24  Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength: 
 
even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him 
 
shall be ashamed. 
25  In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
