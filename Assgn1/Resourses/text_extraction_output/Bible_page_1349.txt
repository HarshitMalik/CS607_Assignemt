  1350    Psalms 108 
42  The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: 
 
and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
43  Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, 
even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.

A Prayer for Help against the Foe 
A Song or Psalm of David. 
1  O God, my heart is fixed; 
 
I will sing and give praise, 
even with my glory. 
2  Awake, psaltery and harp: 
 
I myself will awake early. 
3  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: 
 
and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
4  For thy mercy is great above the heavens: 
 
and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: 
 
and thy glory above all the earth; 
 
6  that thy beloved may be delivered: 
 
save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
7  God hath spoken in his holiness; 
 
I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, 
and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
8  Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; 
   
Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; 
 
Judah is my lawgiver; 
 
9  Moab is my washpot; 
 
over Edom will I cast out my shoe; 
 
over Philistia will I triumph. 
10  Who will bring me into the strong city? 
 
Who will lead me into Edom?
