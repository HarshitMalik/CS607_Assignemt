  126    Exodus 2 
14  and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and 
in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, 
 
wherein they made them serve, was with rigor. 
15  ¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which 
the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; 
 
16  and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew 
women, and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then ye shall kill 
him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 
 
17  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt 
commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 
18  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, 
Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children 
alive? 
 
19  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women 
are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are 
 
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 
20  Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people 
 
multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
21  And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he 
made them houses. 
22  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born 
ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

The Birth of Moses 
1  And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a 
daughter of Levi. 
2  And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him 
 
that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.  
3  And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark 
of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the 
child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. 
 
4  And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
