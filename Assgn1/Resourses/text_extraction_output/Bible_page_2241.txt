The Gospel according to 
St. John 
[John] 
1 
The Word Made Flesh 
1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and 
the Word was God. 
2  The same was in the beginning with God. 
3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing 
 
made that was made. 
4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
 
5  And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended 
 
it not. 
6  ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  
7  The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all 
men through him might believe. 
8  He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 
9  ¶ That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh 
into the world. 
10  He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the 
world knew him not. 
11  He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 
12  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the 
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 
 
13  which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of 
the will of man, but of God. 
14  ¶ And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we 
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) 
full of grace and truth. 
15  John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I 
spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for he was 
 
before me.
