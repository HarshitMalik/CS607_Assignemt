  1776    Ezekiel 13 
9  And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that 
divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither 
 
shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither 
shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am 
 
the Lord God. 
10  Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; 
 
and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others 
 
daubed it with untempered mortar: 
 
11  say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall 
fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great 
   
hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it. 
 
12  Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is 
the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? 
 
13  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; I will even rend it with a 
 
stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower 
 
in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it. 
14  So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered 
mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation 
thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be 
consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the 
 
Lord. 
15  Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them 
that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say unto you, 
The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; 
 
16  to wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, 
and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith 
the Lord God. 
17  Â¶ Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of 
thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy 
 
thou against them, 
18  and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the women that sew 
 
pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every 
stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will 
 
ye save the souls alive that come unto you?
