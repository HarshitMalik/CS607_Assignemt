  552    Joshua 24 
26  And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and 
took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the 
sanctuary of the Lord. 
27  And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a 
witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which 
 
he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye 
 
deny your God. 
28  So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. 
The Death of Joshua 
29  ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, 
the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old. 
30  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-
serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of 
Gaash. 
31  ¶ And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days 
of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the 
works of the Lord, that he had done for Israel. 
Joseph’s Bones Buried at Shechem 
32  ¶ And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up 
out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which 
Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a 
hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the 
 
children of Joseph. 
The Death of Eleazar 
33  ¶ And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill 
 
that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount 
Ephraim.
