  2524    2 Thessalonians 2 
10  when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired 
in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was 
believed) in that day. 
11  Â¶ Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count 
you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his 
goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
 
12  that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and 
ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus 
Christ.

The Revealing of the Man of Sin 
1  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,  
2  that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by 
spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of 
Christ is at hand. 
3  Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, 
 
except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be 
revealed, the son of perdition; 
 
4  who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or 
that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, 
 
showing himself that he is God. 
5  Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these 
things? 
 
6  And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in 
his time. 
7  For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now 
 
letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 
8  And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall 
consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the 
brightness of his coming:
