  2248    John 3 
6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of 
 
the Spirit is spirit. 
7  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 
8  The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound 
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: 
 
so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 
9  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
 
10  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and 
knowest not these things? 
 
11  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and 
testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 
 
12  If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye 
believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 
 
13  And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down 
from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 
14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must 
the Son of man be lifted up: 
 
15  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have 
eternal life. 
God So Loved the World 
16  Â¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have 
everlasting life. 
17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but 
 
that the world through him might be saved. 
18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth 
 
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the 
name of the only begotten Son of God. 
19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, 
and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were 
evil. 
20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to 
the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
