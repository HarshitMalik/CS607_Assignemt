  2489    Ephesians 1 
11  ¶ In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being 
predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all 
things after the counsel of his own will: 
 
12  that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in 
Christ. 
13  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the 
gospel of your salvation: in whom also, after that ye believed, ye 
 
were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, 
14  which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the 
purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. 
Prayer for Knowledge and Understanding 
15  ¶ Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and 
love unto all the saints, 
16  cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my 
prayers; 
 
17  that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give 
unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of 
him: 
 
18  the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may 
 
know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the 
glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
19  and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who 
believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 
20  which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, 
and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, 
21  far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, 
and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in 
that which is to come: 
 
22  and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head 
over all things to the church, 
23  which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
