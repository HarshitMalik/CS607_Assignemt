They are rid of emotional attachment, their sins are erased, and their association with 
the five passions is broken off. Says Nanak, I am every bit a sacrifice to those, within 
whose hearts my Lord God abides.  || 3 ||   SHALOK:  Those who long for the Lord, are 
said to be His servants. Nanak knows this Truth, that the Lord is not separate from His 
Saints.  || 1 ||   CHHANT:  As water mixes and blends with water, so does one‟s light 
mix and blend with the Light. Merging with the perfect, all-powerful Creator, one comes 
to know his own self. Then, one is intuitively absorbed in state of absolute Samaadhi, 
and one speaks of the One and Only Lord. He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is 
liberated; He Himself speaks of Himself. O Nanak, doubts, fears and the limitations of 
the three qualities are dispelled, as one merges, like water blending with water.  || 4 || 
2 ||   WADAHANS,  FIFTH MEHL:  God is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes. 
He preserves the whole world, reaching out with His hand. He is the all-powerful, safe 
Sanctuary, Lord and Master, Treasure of mercy, Giver of peace. I am a sacrifice to Your 
slaves,  who  recognize  only  the  One  Lord.  His  color  and  shape  cannot  be  seen;  His 
description  is  indescribable.  Prays  Nanak,  hear  my  prayer,  O  God,  Almighty  Creator, 
Cause of causes.  || 1 ||   These beings are Yours; You are their Creator. God is the 
Destroyer of pain, suffering and doubt. Eliminate my doubt, pain and suffering in an 
instant, and preserve me, O Lord, Merciful to the meek. You are mother, father and 
friend, O Lord and Master; the whole world is Your child, O Lord of the World. One who 
comes  seeking  Your  Sanctuary  obtains  the  treasure  of  virtue,  and  does  not  have  to 
enter the cycle of birth and death again. Prays Nanak, I am Your slave. All beings are 
Yours; You are their Creator.  || 2 ||   Meditate on the Lord, twenty-four hours a day; 
the  fruits  of  the  heart‟s  desires  are  obtained.  The  heart‟s  desires  are  obtained  by 
meditating on God, and the fear of death is dispelled. I sing of the Lord of the Universe 
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and my hopes are fulfilled. Renouncing 
possessiveness, emotional attachment and all corruption, we become pleasing to the 
Mind of God. Prays Nanak, day and night, meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har.  || 3 
||   At His Door, the unstruck melody resounds. In each and every heart, the Lord, the 
Lord of the Universe, sings. The Lord of the Universe sings, and abides forever; He is 
unfathomable, profoundly deep, lofty  and exalted. His virtues are infinite  —  none of 
them can  be  described. No one  can  reach  Him. He Himself creates, and He Himself 
nurtures; all  beings  and creatures are fashioned by Him. Prays Nanak, peace comes 
from devotional worship of the Naam; at His Door, the unstruck melody resounds.  || 4

Blessed is the Creator, the True King, who has linked the whole world to its tasks. When
