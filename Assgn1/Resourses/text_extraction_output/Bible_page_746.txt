  747    2 Samuel 21 
Abishai Rescues David from the Giant 
15  ¶ Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David 
 
went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the 
Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
 
16  And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of 
whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he 
being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. 
17  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the 
Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, 
saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou 
quench not the light of Israel. 
The Giants Slain by David’s Men 
18  ¶ And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with 
the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, 
 
which was of the sons of the giant. 
19  And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where 
Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of 
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s 
beam. 
20  And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great 
stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six 
toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 
 
21  And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the 
brother of David slew him. 
22  These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of 
David, and by the hand of his servants.
