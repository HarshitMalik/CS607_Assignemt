  1368    Psalms 119 
for I have sought thy precepts. 
95  The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: 
 
but I will consider thy testimonies. 
96  I have seen an end of all perfection: 
 
but thy commandment is exceeding broad.

97  O how love I thy law! 
 
It is my meditation all the day. 
98  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine 
enemies: 
 
for they are ever with me. 
99  I have more understanding than all my teachers: 
 
for thy testimonies are my meditation. 
100  I understand more than the ancients, 
because I keep thy precepts. 
101  I have refrained my feet from every evil way, 
that I might keep thy word. 
102  I have not departed from thy judgments: 
 
for thou hast taught me. 
103  How sweet are thy words unto my taste! 
 
yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth. 
104  Through thy precepts I get understanding: 
 
therefore I hate every false way. 
nun 
105  Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, 
and a light unto my path. 
106  I have sworn, and I will perform it, 
that I will keep thy righteous judgments. 
107  I am afflicted very much: 
 
quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word. 
108  Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O 
Lord, 
and teach me thy judgments. 
109  My soul is continually in my hand: 
 
yet do I not forget thy law.
