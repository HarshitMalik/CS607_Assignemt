  1127    Esther 9 
12  And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and 
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten 
sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s 
 
provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: 
     
or what is thy request further? and it shall be done. 
 
13  Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews 
which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day’s 
decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. 
14  And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was 
 
given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons. 
 
15  For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on 
the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred 
men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. 
 
The Feast of Purim 
16  ¶ But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered 
themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from 
their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but 
they laid not their hands on the prey, 
17  on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth 
 
day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and 
gladness. 
18  But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the 
thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the 
 
fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting 
and gladness. 
19  Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled 
towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of 
gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one 
to another. 
20  ¶ And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the 
Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh 
and far,
