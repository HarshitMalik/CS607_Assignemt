  405    Numbers 36 
9  Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another 
tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep 
 
himself to his own inheritance. 
10  ¶ Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of 
Zelophehad: 
 
11  for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the 
daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s 
brothers’ sons: 
 
12  and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the 
son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the 
family of their father. 
13  ¶ These are the commandments and the judgments, which the 
Lord commanded, by the hand of Moses, unto the children of 
Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
