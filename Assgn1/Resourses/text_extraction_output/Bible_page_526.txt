  527    Joshua 15 
10  And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these 
forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto 
Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and 
 
now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. 
11  As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: 
 
as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both 
to go out, and to come in. 
12  Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in 
that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, 
 
and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the Lord will be 
 
with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said. 
13  Â¶ And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. 
14  Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day; because that he wholly 
 
followed the Lord God of Israel. 
15  And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a 
 
great man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.

The Territory Allotted to Judah 
1  This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their 
families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin 
 
southward was the uttermost part of the south coast. 
2  And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the 
bay that looketh southward: 
 
3  and it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed 
along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-
barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and 
fetched a compass to Karkaa: 
 
4  from thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of 
Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be 
   
your south coast.
