the ground as water.

The Three Appointed Feasts 
1  Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the Lord 
thy God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee 
 
forth out of Egypt by night. 
2  Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord thy God, 
of the flock and the herd, in the place which the Lord shall choose 
to place his name there. 
3  Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat 
 
unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou 
 
camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest 
 
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt 
all the days of thy life. 
4  And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast 
seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou 
 
sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the 
morning. 
5  Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, 
which the Lord thy God giveth thee: 
 
6  but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his 
name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going 
down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 
7  And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy 
God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto 
 
thy tents. 
8  Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day 
 
shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no 
 
work therein.
