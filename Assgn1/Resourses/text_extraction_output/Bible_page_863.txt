  864    2 Kings 13 
14  but they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the 
house of the Lord. 
15  Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they 
delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt 
 
faithfully. 
16  The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house 
of the Lord: it was the priests’.  
 
17  ¶ Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and 
took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
 
18  And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that 
Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of 
Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold 
that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in 
the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went 
 
away from Jerusalem. 
19  ¶ And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
20  And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in 
the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. 
21  For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of 
Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him 
 
with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned 
 
in his stead.

The Reign of Jehoahaz 
1  In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of 
Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in 
Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. 
2  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and 
followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel 
to sin; he departed not therefrom.
