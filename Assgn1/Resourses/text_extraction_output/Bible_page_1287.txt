  1288    Psalms 68 
even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 
25  The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; 
 
among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. 
26  Bless ye God in the congregations, 
even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. 
27  There is little Benjamin with their ruler, 
the princes of Judah and their council, 
the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 
28  Thy God hath commanded thy strength: 
 
strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 
29  Because of thy temple at Jerusalem 
shall kings bring presents unto thee. 
30  Rebuke the company of spearmen, 
the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, 
till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: 
 
scatter thou the people that delight in war. 
31  Princes shall come out of Egypt; 
 
Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. 
32  Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; 
 
O sing praises unto the Lord. 
Selah. 
33  To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, 
which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, 
 
and that a mighty voice. 
34  Ascribe ye strength unto God: 
 
his excellency is over Israel, 
and his strength is in the clouds. 
35  O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: 
 
the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his 
people. 
Blessed be God.
