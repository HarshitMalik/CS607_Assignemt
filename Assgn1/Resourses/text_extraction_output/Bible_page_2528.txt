committed to my trust. 
Paul’s Thankfulness for Mercy 
12  ¶ And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that 
he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
 
13  who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I 
 
obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
14  And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and 
love which is in Christ Jesus. 
15  This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ 
Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
 
16  Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus 
Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them 
which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
17  Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, 
be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
18  ¶ This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the 
prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest 
war a good warfare; 
 
19  holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away, 
 
concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
 
20  of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto 
 
Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

Instructions concerning Prayer 
1  I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, 
intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 
 
2  for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet 
 
and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 
3  For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
