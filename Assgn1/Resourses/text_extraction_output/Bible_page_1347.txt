  1348    Psalms 107 
and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
 
9  For he satisfieth the longing soul, 
and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 
10  Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
being bound in affliction and iron; 
 
11  because they rebelled against the words of God, 
and contemned the counsel of the Most High: 
 
12  therefore he brought down their heart with labor; 
 
they fell down, and there was none to help. 
13  Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, 
and he saved them out of their distresses. 
14  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, 
and brake their bands in sunder. 
15  Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, 
and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
 
16  For he hath broken the gates of brass, 
and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
17  Fools, because of their transgression, 
and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
18  Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; 
 
and they draw near unto the gates of death. 
19  Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, 
and he saveth them out of their distresses. 
20  He sent his word, and healed them, 
and delivered them from their destructions. 
21  Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, 
and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
 
22  And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, 
and declare his works with rejoicing. 
23  They that go down to the sea in ships, 
that do business in great waters; 
 
24  these see the works of the Lord, 
and his wonders in the deep. 
25  For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, 
which lifteth up the waves thereof.
