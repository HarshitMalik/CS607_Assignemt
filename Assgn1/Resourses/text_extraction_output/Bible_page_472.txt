  473    Deuteronomy 28 
7  ¶ The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to 
be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one 
 
way, and flee before thee seven ways. 
8  The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy 
storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he 
 
shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 
9  The Lord shall establish thee a holy people unto himself, as he 
hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the 
Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. 
10  And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the 
name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee. 
 
11  And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of 
thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy 
ground, in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers to give 
thee. 
12  The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to 
give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of 
thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt 
 
not borrow. 
13  And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou 
 
shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou 
 
hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I 
command thee this day, to observe and to do them: 
 
14  and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I 
command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after 
other gods to serve them.  
The Consequences of Disobedience 
15  ¶ But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice 
of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and 
his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses 
 
shall come upon thee, and overtake thee: 
 
16  Cursed shalt thou be in the city, 
and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
