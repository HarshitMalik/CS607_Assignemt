The Numbering of Israel at Sinai 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 
tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second 
month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of 
Egypt, saying, 
2  Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, 
after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number 
of their names, every male by their polls; 
 
3  from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to 
war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. 
 
4  And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of 
 
the house of his fathers. 
5  And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the 
 
tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
 
6  Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
 
7  Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 
 
8  Of Issachar; Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 
 
9  Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon. 
 
10  Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of
