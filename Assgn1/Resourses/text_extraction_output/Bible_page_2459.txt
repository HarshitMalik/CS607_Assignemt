  2460    2 Corinthians 3 
5  not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of 
ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; 
   
6  who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of 
 
the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit 
 
giveth life. 
7  ¶ But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, 
was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly 
behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which 
 
glory was to be done away; 
 
8  how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
 
9  For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth 
the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
10  For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, 
by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
11  For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which 
remaineth is glorious. 
12  ¶ Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of 
speech: 
 
13  and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of 
Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is 
abolished: 
 
14  but their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same 
 
veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is 
 
done away in Christ. 
15  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their 
heart. 
16  Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken 
away. 
17  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
 
there is liberty. 
18  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the 
Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as 
by the Spirit of the Lord.
