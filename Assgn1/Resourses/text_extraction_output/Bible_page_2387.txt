  2388    Acts 28 
Paul Preaches in Rome 
17  ¶ And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of 
the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto 
 
them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against 
the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner 
from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: 
 
18  who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because 
there was no cause of death in me. 
19  But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal 
unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of. 
 
20  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to 
speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with 
 
this chain. 
21  And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judea 
concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came showed or 
spake any harm of thee. 
22  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning 
 
this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. 
23  ¶ And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to 
him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the 
 
kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of 
the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till 
evening. 
24  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some 
believed not. 
25  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after 
that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by 
Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers, 
26  saying, 
Go unto this people, and say, 
Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; 
 
and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: 
 
27  for the heart of this people is waxed gross, 
and their ears are dull of hearing,
