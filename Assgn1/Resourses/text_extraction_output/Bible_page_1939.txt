  1940    Amos 8 
12  Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into 
the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
 
13  but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king’s 
 
chapel, and it is the king’s court. 
14  ¶ Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, 
neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer 
 
of sycamore fruit: 
 
15  and the Lord took me as I followed the flock, and the Lord said 
unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. 
16  Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, 
 
Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the 
house of Isaac. 
17  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the 
 
city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy 
land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: 
   
and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

The Basket of Summer Fruit 
1  Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: and behold a basket of 
 
summer fruit. 
2  And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of 
 
summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The end is come upon 
my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more. 
 
3  And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the 
Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall 
   
cast them forth with silence. 
Israel’s Doom at Hand 
4  ¶ Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor 
of the land to fail,
