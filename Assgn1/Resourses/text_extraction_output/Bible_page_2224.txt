  2225    Luke 20 
35  but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and 
the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in 
marriage: 
 
36  neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; 
   
and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 
37  Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, 
when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of 
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  
38  For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto 
 
him. 
39  Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well 
said. 
40  And after that they durst not ask him any question at all. 
The Question about David’s Son 
41  ¶ And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son? 
 
42  And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, 
The Lord said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, 
43  till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  
44  David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? 
 
Jesus Denounces the Scribes 
45  ¶ Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
46  Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love 
greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, 
and the chief rooms at feasts; 
 
47  which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: 
 
the same shall receive greater damnation.
