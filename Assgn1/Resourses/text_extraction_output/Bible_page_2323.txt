  2324    Acts 7 
20  In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and 
nourished up in his father’s house three months:  
 
21  and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and 
nourished him for her own son.  
22  And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was 
mighty in words and in deeds. 
23  ¶ And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to 
visit his brethren the children of Israel. 
24  And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged 
him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: 
 
25  for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God 
by his hand would deliver them; but they understood not. 
 
26  And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and 
would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why 
 
do ye wrong one to another? 
 
27  But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who 
made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
 
28  Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? 
 
29  Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of 
Midian, where he begat two sons.  
30  ¶ And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the 
wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in 
a bush. 
31  When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near 
 
to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, 
32  saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham and the 
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and 
durst not behold. 
33  Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the 
 
place where thou standest is holy ground. 
34  I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in 
Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to 
deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
