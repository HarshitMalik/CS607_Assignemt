  1274    Psalms 58 
they have digged a pit before me, 
into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. 
Selah. 
7  My heart is fixed, O God, 
my heart is fixed: 
 
I will sing and give praise. 
8  Awake up, my glory; 
 
awake, psaltery and harp: 
 
I myself will awake early. 
9  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: 
 
I will sing unto thee among the nations. 
10  For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, 
and thy truth unto the clouds. 
11  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: 
 
let thy glory be above all the earth.

A Prayer for the Punishment of the Wicked 
To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David. 
1  Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? 
 
Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
 
2  Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; 
 
ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 
3  The wicked are estranged from the womb: 
 
they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 
4  Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: 
 
they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 
 
5  which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, 
charming never so wisely. 
6  Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: 
 
break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord. 
7  Let them melt away as waters which run continually:
