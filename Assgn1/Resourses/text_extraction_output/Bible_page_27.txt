  28    Genesis 13 
11  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, 
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a 
fair woman to look upon: 
 
12  therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, 
that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they 
 
will save thee alive. 
13  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for 
 
thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 
 
14  And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the 
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
15  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before 
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
 
16  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and 
 
oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she 
asses, and camels. 
17  ¶ And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, 
because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 
18  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast 
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 
   
19  Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me 
 
to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
 
20  And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent 
 
him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

Abram and Lot Separate 
1  And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he 
had, and Lot with him, into the south. 
2  ¶ And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
3  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto 
the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-
el and Hai;
