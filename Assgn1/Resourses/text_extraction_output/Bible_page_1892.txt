the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both 
the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
 
14  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; 
 
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. 
15  ¶ And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, 
and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as 
the appearance of a man. 
16  And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, 
and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
17  So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, 
 
and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of 
 
man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. 
 
18  ¶ Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face 
toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
 
19  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the 
last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall 
 
be. 
20  The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of 
Media and Persia. 
21  And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is 
 
between his eyes is the first king. 
22  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four 
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 
23  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are 
come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding 
dark sentences, shall stand up. 
24  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he 
 
shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall 
destroy the mighty and the holy people. 
25  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his 
hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall 
 
destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; 
   
but he shall be broken without hand.
