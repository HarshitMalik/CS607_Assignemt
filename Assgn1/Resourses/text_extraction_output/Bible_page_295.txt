  296    Leviticus 27 
39  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in 
your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall 
 
they pine away with them. 
40  ¶ If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their 
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and 
that also they have walked contrary unto me; 
 
41  and that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought 
them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised 
 
hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their 
iniquity: 
 
42  then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my 
covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I 
remember; and I will remember the land. 
 
43  The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, 
while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the 
 
punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised 
 
my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. 
44  And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I 
will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them 
utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord 
 
their God. 
45  But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, 
whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the 
heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord. 
 
46  ¶ These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord 
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the 
hand of Moses.
