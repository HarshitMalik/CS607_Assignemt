  40    Genesis 19 
19 
The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah 
1  And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the 
 
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he 
   
bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
 
2  and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your 
servantâ€™s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye 
shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we 
 
will abide in the street all night. 
3  And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, 
 
and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake 
 
unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
4  But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of 
Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the 
people from every quarter: 
 
5  and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men 
which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we 
 
may know them. 
6  And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after 
him, 
7  and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
8  Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let 
 
me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is 
good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore 
   
came they under the shadow of my roof. 
9  And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow 
came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal 
 
worse with thee than with them. And they pressed sore upon the 
man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 
10  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to 
them, and shut to the door.
