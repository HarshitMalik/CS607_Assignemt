adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his 
 
master? should it not be with the heads of these men? 
   
5  Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, 
saying, 
Saul slew his thousands, 
and David his ten thousands? 
 
6  ¶ Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the 
Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy 
coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not 
 
found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this 
day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not. 
 
7  Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the 
lords of the Philistines. 
8  And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast 
 
thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this 
day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the 
king? 
 
9  And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good 
in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding, the princes of the 
 
Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. 
10  Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s 
servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in 
 
the morning, and have light, depart. 
11  So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to 
return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up 
to Jezreel.

David Defeats the Amalekites 
1  And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag 
on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and 
Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
