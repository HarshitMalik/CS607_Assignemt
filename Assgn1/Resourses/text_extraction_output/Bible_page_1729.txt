  1730    Jeremiah 51 
51 
The Lord’s Judgment on Babylon 
1  Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and 
 
against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against 
me, a destroying wind; 
 
2  and will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall 
empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her 
 
round about. 
3  Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against 
him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her 
 
young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. 
 
4  Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that 
are thrust through in her streets. 
5  For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord 
of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One 
 
of Israel. 
6  ¶ Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: 
 
be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord’s 
 
vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense. 
 
7  Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord’s hand, that made all 
the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; 
   
therefore the nations are mad. 
8  Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm 
   
for her pain, if so be she may be healed. 
9  We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, 
 
and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment 
 
reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. 
10  The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us 
 
declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God. 
11  ¶ Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord hath raised 
   
up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against 
 
Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the 
 
vengeance of his temple.
