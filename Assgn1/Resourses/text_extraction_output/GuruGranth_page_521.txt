One unto whom You are Merciful, has his sufferings depart. O Merciful Lord, You bless 
Your devotees with Your Grace. Suffering, pain, terrible disease and Maya do not afflict 
them. This is the Support of the devotees, that they sing the Glorious Praises of the 
Lord of the Universe. Forever and ever, day and night, they meditate on the One and 
Only Lord. Drinking in  the Ambrosial  Amrit of the Naam, the Name of the  Lord, His 
humble servants remain satisfied with the Naam.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  
Millions of obstacles stand in the way of one who forgets the Name. O Nanak, night and 
day, he croaks like a raven in a deserted house.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Beauteous is 
that season, when I am united with my Beloved. I do not forget Him for a moment or 
an instant; O Nanak, I contemplate Him constantly.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Even brave and 
mighty  men  cannot  withstand  the  powerful  and  overwhelming  army  which  the  five 
passions have gathered. The ten organs of sensation attach even detached renunciates 
to sensory pleasures. They seek to conquer and overpower them, and so increase their 
following. The world of the three dispositions is under their influence; no one can stand 
against  them.  So  tell  me  —  how  can  the  fort  of  doubt  and  the  moat  of  Maya  be 
overcome?  Worshipping  the  Perfect  Guru,  this  awesome  force  is  subdued.  I  stand 
before Him, day and night, with my palms pressed together.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH 
MEHL:  All sins are washed away, by continually singing the Lord‟s Glories. Millions of 
afflictions are produced, O Nanak, when the Name is forgotten.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  
O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, one comes to know the Perfect Way. While laughing, 
playing, dressing and eating, he is liberated.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Blessed, blessed is the 
True Guru, who has demolished the fortress of doubt. Waaho! Waaho! — Hail! Hail! to 
the True Guru, who has united me with the Lord. The Guru has given me the medicine 
of  the  inexhaustible  treasure  of  the  Naam.  He  has  banished  the  great  and  terrible 
disease. I have obtained the great treasure of the wealth of the Naam. I have obtained 
eternal life, recognizing my own self. The Glory of the all-powerful Divine Guru cannot 
be  described.  The  Guru  is  the  Supreme  Lord  God,  the  Transcendent  Lord,  infinite, 
unseen and unknowable.  || 16 ||   SHALOK,  FIFTH MEHL:  Make the effort, and you 
shall live; practicing it, you shall enjoy peace. Meditating, you shall meet God, O Nanak, 
and your anxiety shall vanish.  || 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Bless me with sublime thoughts, 
O  Lord  of  the  Universe,  and  contemplation  in  the  immaculate  Saadh  Sangat,  the 
Company of the Holy. O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, 
for even an instant; be merciful to me, Lord God.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  Whatever happens 
is according to Your Will, so why should I be afraid? Meeting Him, I meditate on the 
Name  —  I  offer  my  soul  to  Him.  When  the  Infinite  Lord  comes  to  mind,  one  is 
enraptured. Who can touch one who has the Formless Lord on his side? Everything is 
under His control; no one is beyond Him. He, the True Lord, dwells in the minds of His 
devotees.
