  383    Numbers 28 
17  And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall 
 
unleavened bread be eaten.  
18  In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of 
 
servile work therein: 
 
19  but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto 
the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of 
 
the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish. 
 
20  And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three 
 
tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a 
ram; 
 
21  a several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the 
seven lambs: 
 
22  and one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you. 
23  Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which 
is for a continual burnt offering. 
24  After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, 
the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the 
Lord: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and 
 
his drink offering. 
25  And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall 
 
do no servile work. 
26  Â¶ Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat 
offering unto the Lord, after your weeks be out, ye shall have a 
holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: 
   
27  but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the 
Lord; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year; 
   
28  and their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals 
unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram, 
29  a several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 
 
30  and one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. 
31  Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat 
offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish,) and their drink 
offerings.
