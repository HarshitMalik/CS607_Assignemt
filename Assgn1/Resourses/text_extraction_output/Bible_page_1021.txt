  1022    2 Chronicles 25 
25 
The Reign of Amaziah 
1  Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and 
he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s 
name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not 
with a perfect heart. 
3  Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, 
that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. 
4  But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in 
the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The 
fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die 
for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.  
5  ¶ Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them 
captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to 
the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and 
 
he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found 
them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, 
that could handle spear and shield. 
6  He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel 
for a hundred talents of silver. 
7  But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the 
army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, 
 
with all the children of Ephraim. 
8  But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make 
 
thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast 
 
down. 
9  And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the 
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the 
 
man of God answered, The Lord is able to give thee much more 
than this. 
10  Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to 
him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was
