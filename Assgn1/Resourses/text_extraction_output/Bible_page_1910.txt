  1911    Hosea 6 
8  ¶ Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry 
 
aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. 
9  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of 
 
Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
10  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: 
 
therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
11  Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly 
walked after the commandment. 
12  Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of 
Judah as rottenness. 
13  ¶ When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then 
went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb [or, to the 
king that should plead]: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of 
 
your wound. 
14  For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the 
house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and 
   
none shall rescue him. 
The Insincerity of Israel’s Repentance 
15  ¶ I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their 
offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early. 
 
6 
1  Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he 
 
will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
 
2  After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, 
 
and we shall live in his sight. 
3  Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going 
 
forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the 
 
rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. 
4  ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do 
 
unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early 
 
dew it goeth away.
