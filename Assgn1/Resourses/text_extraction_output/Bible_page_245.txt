36  So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded 
by the hand of Moses.

Aaron Offers Sacrifices 
1  And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and 
his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
 
2  and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, 
and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them 
before the Lord. 
3  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a 
kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the 
 
first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
 
4  also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for today the Lord 
   
will appear unto you. 
5  And they brought that which Moses commanded before the 
tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near 
 
and stood before the Lord. 
6  And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that 
ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you. 
 
7  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin 
offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for 
thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and 
 
make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded. 
 
8  Â¶ Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin 
offering, which was for himself. 
9  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped 
 
his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and 
poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 
 
10  but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin 
offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
11  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
