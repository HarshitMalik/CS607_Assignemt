  483    Deuteronomy 31 
3  The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy 
these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and 
 
Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath said. 
4  And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, 
kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he 
destroyed.  
5  And the Lord shall give them up before your face, that ye may do 
unto them according unto all the commandments which I have 
commanded you. 
6  Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for 
 
the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail 
 
thee, nor forsake thee. 
7  ¶ And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of 
all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with 
 
this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their 
fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 
 
8  And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with 
 
thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be 
 
dismayed. 
9  ¶ And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the 
sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and 
unto all the elders of Israel. 
10  And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven 
years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of 
tabernacles,  
11  when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the 
place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all 
Israel in their hearing. 
12  Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and 
thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that 
they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all 
the words of this law: 
 
13  and that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, 
and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land 
whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
