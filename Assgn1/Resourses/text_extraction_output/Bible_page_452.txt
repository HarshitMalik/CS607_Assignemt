  453    Deuteronomy 19 
16  according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb 
in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice 
of the Lord my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, 
that I die not. 
17  And the Lord said unto me, They have well spoken that which they 
have spoken. 
18  I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto 
thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto 
 
them all that I shall command him. 
19  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my 
words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.  
20  But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, 
which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in 
the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. 
21  And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which 
the Lord hath not spoken? 
 
22  when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing 
follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath 
not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou 
 
shalt not be afraid of him. 
19 
The Cities of Refuge 
1  When the Lord thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the 
Lord thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest 
in their cities, and in their houses; 
 
2  thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, 
which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it. 
3  Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, 
which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, 
that every slayer may flee thither.
