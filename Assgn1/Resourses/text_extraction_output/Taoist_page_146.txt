inwardly agitated by roaming thoughts and miscellaneous
ideasâ€”all of this is false.
The  false  is  antagonistic  to  the  true,  so  if  it  is  not
eliminated  it  will  harm  the  true.  But  to  get  rid  of  it  you
have  to  find  the  appropriate  way.  If  you  do  not  find  the
way, it is like shutting the door to catch a robber; the false
cannot be eliminated and the true is sure to get hurt.
People  who  are  not  of  the  highest  wisdom  are
influenced and conditioned by false images every day, so
they  lose  sight  of  natural  realities.  They  are  so  used  to
untruth that it becomes truth for them.
Even  if  there  are  some  who  have  a  little  higher
consciousness and clearly know that worldly affairs are all
artificial,  when  taught  to  cultivate  the  real  they  still  find
the artificial hard to relinquish. If they are to be resolute,
they  first  have  to  refine  themselves  within  the  artificial
until  they  feel  they  have  no  more  interest  in  artificial
things;  if  they  set  them  aside  to  seek  the  real  after  that,
then they will be able to find the real.
If you happen to have been born in a rural area and are
basically uncomplicated and unaffected, and never having
experienced  the  bedazzlement  of  prosperity  you  do  not
know there is such a thing as artificiality, then you do not
know  there  is  reality  either.  That  is  because  the  real  is
hidden within the artificial and the artificial is not outside
the real. What is quintessential is to be able to find out the
real in the midst of the artificial and discern the artificial in
the midst of the real.
