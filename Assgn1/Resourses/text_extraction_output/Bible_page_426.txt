  427    Deuteronomy 7 
14  Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or 
 
female barren among you, or among your cattle. 
15  And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness, and will put 
none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; 
 
but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. 
16  And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God 
shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither 
   
shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.  
 
17  Â¶ If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; 
 
how can I dispossess them? 
 
18  Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the 
 
Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 
 
19  the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the 
wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby 
the Lord thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do 
 
unto all the people of whom thou art afraid. 
20  Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them, 
until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be 
destroyed. 
21  Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the Lord thy God is 
 
among you, a mighty God and terrible. 
22  And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by 
little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the 
 
beasts of the field increase upon thee. 
23  But the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall 
destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. 
24  And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt 
destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able 
 
to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 
25  The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt 
 
not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, 
lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord 
 
thy God.
