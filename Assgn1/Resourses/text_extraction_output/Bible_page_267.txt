of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into 
the wilderness: 
 
22  and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not 
inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 
 
23  ¶ And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, 
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he 
went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:  
 
24  and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on 
his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the 
burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, 
and for the people. 
25  And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
26  And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, 
and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 
27  And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin 
offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the 
holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall 
 
burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
28  And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his 
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. 
29  ¶ And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh 
 
month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, 
and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a 
stranger that sojourneth among you: 
 
30  for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to 
cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the 
Lord. 
31  It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, 
by a statute for ever. 
32  And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall 
consecrate to minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, 
shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even 
the holy garments: 
 
33  and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he 
shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation,
