  2289    John 15 
13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for 
his friends. 
14  Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 
15  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not 
 
what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that 
   
I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. 
16  Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, 
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should 
remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he 
 
may give it you. 
17  These things I command you, that ye love one another. 
The World’s Hatred 
18  ¶ If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated 
you. 
19  If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because 
 
ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, 
therefore the world hateth you. 
20  Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater 
than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute 
you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. 
 
21  But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, 
because they know not him that sent me. 
22  If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but 
 
now they have no cloak for their sin. 
23  He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
24  If I had not done among them the works which none other man 
did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated 
 
both me and my Father. 
25  But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is 
written in their law, They hated me without a cause.  
26  But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from 
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the 
Father, he shall testify of me:
