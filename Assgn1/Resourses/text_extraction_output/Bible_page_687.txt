  688    1 Samuel 29 
21  And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, 
and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, 
and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy 
words which thou spakest unto me. 
22  Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of 
thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and 
 
eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
23  But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together 
with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their 
 
voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
24  And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and 
 
killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened 
bread thereof: 
 
25  and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did 
 
eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

3  Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews 
here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this 
 
David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with 
me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him 
since he fell unto me unto this day? 
 
4  And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the 
 
princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, 
that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, 
and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an
