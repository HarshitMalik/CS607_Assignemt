  2293    John 17 
4  I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which 
 
thou gavest me to do. 
5  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the 
glory which I had with thee before the world was. 
6  Â¶ I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me 
out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and 
   
they have kept thy word. 
7  Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given 
me are of thee. 
8  For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and 
 
they have received them, and have known surely that I came out 
from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. 
9  I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou 
 
hast given me; for they are thine. 
 
10  And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in 
 
them. 
11  And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, 
and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name 
those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. 
12  While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: 
 
those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but 
the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.  
 
13  And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that 
 
they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 
14  I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, 
 
because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
15  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that 
thou shouldest keep them from the evil. 
16  They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 
 
18  As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them 
into the world. 
19  And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be 
sanctified through the truth.
