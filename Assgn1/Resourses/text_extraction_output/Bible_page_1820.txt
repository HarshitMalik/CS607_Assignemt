  1821    Ezekiel 31 
19  Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I 
 
am the Lord. 
20  ¶ And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the 
seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto 
me, saying, 
21  Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, 
 
lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to 
make it strong to hold the sword. 
22  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against Pharaoh 
 
king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which 
was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 
 
23  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will 
disperse them through the countries. 
24  And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my 
sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall 
 
groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. 
25  But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms 
of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the 
 
Lord, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of 
Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. 
26  And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse 
them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the 
 
Lord. 
31 
1  And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the 
first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, 
saying, 
2  Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his 
multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
   
3  Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, 
and with a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature; and his top 
 
was among the thick boughs.
