  67    Genesis 29 
21  so that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the 
 
Lord be my God: 
 
22  and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: 
 
and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto 
thee.

Jacob Serves Laban for Rachel and Leah 
1  Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the 
people of the east. 
2  And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were 
three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered

6  And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, 
   
behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. 
7  And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle 
should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed

sheep. 
9  ¶ And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s 
sheep: for she kept them. 
 
10  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban 
his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother,
