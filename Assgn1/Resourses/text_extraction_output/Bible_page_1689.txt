  1690    Jeremiah 34 
the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, 
and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
4  Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus 
 
saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword; 
 
5  but thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, 
 
the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odors 
for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have 
   
pronounced the word, saith the Lord. 
6  ¶ Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah 
king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
7  when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and 
against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and 
against Azekah: for these defensed cities remained of the cities of 
 
Judah. 
The Broken Covenant concerning Hebrew Servants 
8  ¶ This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after 
that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people 
which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 
 
9  that every man should let his manservant, and every man his 
maidservant, being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none 
 
should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. 
10  Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered 
into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, 
and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve 
themselves of them any more; then they obeyed, and let them go. 
 
11  But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the 
handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought 
them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
12  ¶ Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the 
Lord, saying, 
13  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with 
 
your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of 
Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
