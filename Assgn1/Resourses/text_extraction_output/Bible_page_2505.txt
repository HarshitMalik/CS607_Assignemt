4 
Rejoice in the Lord 
1  Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and 
crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. 
2  ¶ I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same 
mind in the Lord. 
3  And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which 
labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other 
my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life. 
4  ¶ Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. 
 
5  Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 
6  Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and 
 
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known 
unto God. 
7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep 
your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
Think on These Things 
8  ¶ Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, 
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; 
 
if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these 
things. 
9  Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, 
and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. 
 
Acknowledgment of the Philippians’ Gift 
10  ¶ But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of 
me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye 
 
lacked opportunity.
