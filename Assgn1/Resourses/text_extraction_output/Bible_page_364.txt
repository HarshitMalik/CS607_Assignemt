  365    Numbers 22 
6  come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are 
 
too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite 
 
them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he 
 
whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
7  ¶ And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with 
the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto 
 
Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
8  And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you 
word again, as the Lord shall speak unto me: and the princes of 
 
Moab abode with Balaam. 
9  And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with 
thee? 
 
10  And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, 
hath sent unto me, saying, 
11  Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face 
of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be 
   
able to overcome them, and drive them out. 
12  And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou 
 
shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. 
 
13  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of 
Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to give me 
 
leave to go with you. 
14  And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and 
said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 
15  ¶ And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than 
they. 
16  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the 
son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming 
unto me: 
 
17  for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do 
whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse 
 
me this people. 
18  And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak 
would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond 
the word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.
