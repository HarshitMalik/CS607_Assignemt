  2624    Revelation 6 
12  saying with a loud voice, 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and 
wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. 
13  And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under 
the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard 
I saying, 
Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth 
upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. 
14  And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell 
down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

The Seals 
1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it 
were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and 
see. 
2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a 
 
bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth 
   
conquering, and to conquer. 
3  ¶ And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second 
beast say, Come and see. 
4  And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given 
 
to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they 
should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great 
 
sword. 
5  ¶ And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast 
say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that 
 
sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 
6  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of 
wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see 
 
thou hurt not the oil and the wine. 
7  ¶ And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the 
fourth beast say, Come and see.
