  2346    Acts 14 
I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, 
that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.  
48  Â¶ And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified 
the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life 
 
believed. 
49  And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. 
50  But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the 
chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and 
Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. 
51  But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came 
unto Iconium. 
52  And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

Paul and Barnabas at Iconium 
1  And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into 
the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both 
of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 
2  But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their 
minds evil affected against the brethren. 
3  Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which 
gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and 
wonders to be done by their hands. 
4  But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the 
 
Jews, and part with the apostles. 
5  And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also 
of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone 
them, 
6  they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of 
Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 
 
7  and there they preached the gospel.
