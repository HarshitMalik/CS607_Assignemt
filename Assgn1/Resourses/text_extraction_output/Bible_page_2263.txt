  2264    John 7 
34  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye 
 
cannot come. 
35  Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we 
shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the 
 
Gentiles [Greeks], and teach the Gentiles [Greeks]? 
 
36  What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and 
shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? 
   
Rivers of Living Water 
37  ¶ In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, 
saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
38  He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly 
shall flow rivers of living water.  
39  (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him 
should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that 
   
Jesus was not yet glorified.) 
Division among the People 
40  ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, 
Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
41  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out 
of Galilee? 
 
42  Hath not the Scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of 
David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 
 
43  So there was a division among the people because of him. 
44  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands 
 
on him. 
The Unbelief of Those in Authority 
45  ¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they 
 
said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
 
46  The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
