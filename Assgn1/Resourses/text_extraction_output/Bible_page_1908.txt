  1909    Hosea 4 
3  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth 
therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the 
fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. 
 
4  ¶ Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as 
 
they that strive with the priest. 
5  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall 
with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. 
6  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast 
 
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no 
priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will 
 
also forget thy children. 
7  ¶ As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I 
 
change their glory into shame. 
8  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their 
iniquity. 
9  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them 
 
for their ways, and reward them their doings. 
10  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit 
 
whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take 
 
heed to the Lord. 
11  ¶ Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. 
12  My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto 
them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they 
 
have gone a whoring from under their God. 
13  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense 
upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the 
shadow thereof is good. 
¶ Therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your 
spouses shall commit adultery. 
14  I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, 
nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are 
 
separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore 
 
the people that doth not understand shall fall.
