  2201    Luke 13 
51  Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; 
   
but rather division: 
 
52  for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three 
against two, and two against three. 
53  The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the 
father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against 
 
the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and 
 
the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  
Discerning the Times 
54  ¶ And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the 
west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. 
 
55  And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; 
 
and it cometh to pass. 
56  Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but 
 
how is it that ye do not discern this time? 
 
Agree with Your Adversary 
57  ¶ Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? 
 
58  When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art 
in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; 
 
lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the 
officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. 
59  I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very 
last mite.
