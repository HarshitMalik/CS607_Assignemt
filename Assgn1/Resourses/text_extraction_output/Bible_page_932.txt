David’s Army 
1  Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept 
himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among 
 
the mighty men, helpers of the war. 
2  They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and 
the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of 
Saul’s brethren of Benjamin. 
3  The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the 
Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and 
   
Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite, 
4  and Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and 
over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and 
 
Josabad the Gederathite, 
5  Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah 
the Haruphite, 
6  Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the 
Korhites, 
7  and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
8  ¶ And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into 
the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the 
battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like 
the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 
 
9  Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
10  Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
11  Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
