  341    Numbers 14 
14 
The People Rebel against the Lord 
1  And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the 
 
people wept that night. 
2  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against 
Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God 
 
that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in 
 
this wilderness! 
 
3  And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by 
the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were 
 
it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
 
4  ¶ And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us 
return into Egypt. 
5  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of 
the congregation of the children of Israel. 
6  And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which 
were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 
 
7  and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, 
saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an 
exceeding good land. 
8  If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and 
give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 
 
9  Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of 
the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from 
   
them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not. 
 
10  But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. 
¶ And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the 
congregation before all the children of Israel. 
11  And the Lord said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke 
me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs 
 
which I have showed among them? 
 
12  I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will 
make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
