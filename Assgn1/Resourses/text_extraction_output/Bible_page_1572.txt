  1573    Isaiah 45 
22  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a 
cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 
   
23  Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower 
   
parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, 
 
and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and 
 
glorified himself in Israel. 
24  Â¶ Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee 
from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that 
 
stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth 
 
by myself; 
 
25  that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; 
 
that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge 
foolish;  
 
26  that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the 
counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be 
 
inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will 
 
raise up the decayed places thereof: 
 
27  that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 
 
28  that saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my 
pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the 
   
temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

The Commission to Cyrus 
1  Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I 
have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the 
 
loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates; and the 
 
gates shall not be shut; 
 
2  I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will 
 
break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
 
3  and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of 
secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call 
thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.
