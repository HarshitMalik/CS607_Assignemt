  2085    Matthew 26 
Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus 
14  ¶ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief 
priests, 
15  and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him 
unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 
 
16  And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 
Jesus Eats the Passover with His Disciples 
17  ¶ Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples 
came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare 
for thee to eat the passover? 
 
18  And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The 
Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy 
 
house with my disciples. 
19  And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made 
 
ready the passover. 
20  ¶ Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
21  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you 
shall betray me. 
22  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them 
to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
 
23  And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the 
dish, the same shall betray me. 
24  The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that 
 
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that 
 
man if he had not been born. 
25  Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? 
 
He said unto him, Thou hast said. 
26  ¶ And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and 
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my 
 
body. 
27  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 
Drink ye all of it;
