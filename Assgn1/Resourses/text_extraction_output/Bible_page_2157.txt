  2158    Luke 2 
34  And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, 
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for 
 
a sign which shall be spoken against; 
 
35  (yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also;) that the 
 
thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 
36  ¶ And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, 
of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a 
 
husband seven years from her virginity; 
 
37  and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which 
departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and 
prayers night and day. 
38  And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, 
and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in 
Jerusalem. 
The Return to Nazareth 
39  ¶ And when they had performed all things according to the law of 
the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.  
40  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; 
 
and the grace of God was upon him. 
The Boy Jesus in the Temple 
41  ¶ Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the 
passover.  
42  And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after 
the custom of the feast. 
43  And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child 
Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew 
 
not of it. 
44  But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s 
journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and 
 
acquaintance.
