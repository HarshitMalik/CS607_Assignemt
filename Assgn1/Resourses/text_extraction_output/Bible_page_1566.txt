  1567    Isaiah 42 
cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and 
 
spirit to them that walk therein: 
 
6  I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine 
hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the 
people, for a light of the Gentiles;  
 
7  to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, 
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 
8  I am the Lord; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to 
   
another, neither my praise to graven images. 
9  Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I 
declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them. 
 
Praise for the Lord’s Mighty Deliverance 
10  ¶ Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of 
the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the 
 
isles, and the inhabitants thereof. 
11  Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the 
villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, 
 
let them shout from the top of the mountains. 
12  Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the 
islands. 
13  The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy 
like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his 
   
enemies. 
14  ¶ I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained 
 
myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and 
   
devour at once. 
15  I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; 
 
and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. 
16  And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead 
 
them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light 
 
before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do 
unto them, and not forsake them.
