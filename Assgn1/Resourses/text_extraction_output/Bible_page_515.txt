  516    Joshua 10 
of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all 
their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. 
6  ¶ And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, 
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us 
 
quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites 
 
that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. 
7  So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with 
him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
8  And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have 
 
delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them 
 
stand before thee. 
9  Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from 
Gilgal all night. 
10  And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with 
a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that 
goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto 
Makkedah. 
11  And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the 
going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones 
from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were 
 
more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of 
Israel slew with the sword. 
12  ¶ Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord 
delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said 
in the sight of Israel, 
Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; 
 
and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. 
13  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, 
until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. 
Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in 
 
the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. 
14  And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord 
hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel. 
 
15  ¶ And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to 
Gilgal.
