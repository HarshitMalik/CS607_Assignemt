When  adulthood  is  reached,  then  one  is  faced  with
work.  Those  who  become  rulers  worry  about  the  land;
those  who  become  gentry  and  peasants  worry  about  their
persons  and  their  families.  Day  and  night  they  labor,
uneasy  even  when  sitting  or  lying  down.  The  fires  in  the
internal organs are all active, burning the natural harmony.
Illnesses dog the body, without resistance.
People first experience the suffering of illness, wind up
in the suffering of dying, and afterward have the suffering
of  retribution.  It  goes  on  through  the  ages,  repeating
endlessly.  Buddhists  speak  of  the  suffering  of  separation
from  loved  ones,  the  suffering  of  association  with  the
hostile,  the  suffering  of  unfulfillment.  The  sufferings  and
miseries  of  people  today  are  all  self-made  and  self-
experienced,  personal  experience  of  what  they  have
created  themselves.  There  are  those  who  mistakenly  get
involved because they do not know this is suffering; there
are  those  who  clearly  know  it  is  suffering  but  cannot  get
out.
A proverb says, “Don’t talk about getting married early;
after  marriage  it’s  harder.  Don’t  say  success  is  high
attainment; after success work is greater. Don’t say sowing
seeds is enough; after the sowing it’s more toilsome. Don’t
say  it’s  better  to  be  a  monk  or  a  priest;  after  becoming  a
monk or a priest it’s mentally harder.”
Some  may  ask,  while  the  sufferings  of  worldly  people
are mostly physical, the sufferings of scholars are mental;
they  bind  themselves  with  no  rope  and  busy  themselves
