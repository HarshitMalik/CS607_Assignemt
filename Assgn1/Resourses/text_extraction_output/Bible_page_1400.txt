and punishments upon the people;

A Call to Praise God with Musical Instruments 
1  Praise ye the Lord. 
Praise God in his sanctuary: 
 
praise him in the firmament of his power. 
2  Praise him for his mighty acts: 
 
praise him according to his excellent greatness. 
3  Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: 
 
praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
4  Praise him with the timbrel and dance: 
 
praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
5  Praise him upon the loud cymbals: 
 
praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
6  Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. 
Praise ye the Lord.
