  986    2 Chronicles 7 
42  O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember 
 
the mercies of David thy servant.  
7 
1  Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came 
down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the 
sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. 
 
2  And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, 
because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house. 
3  And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, 
and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves 
with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, 
and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth 
 
for ever.  
4  ¶ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
Lord. 
5  And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand 
oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and 
all the people dedicated the house of God. 
6  And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with 
 
instruments of music of the Lord, which David the king had made 
to praise the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever, when 
David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets 
 
before them, and all Israel stood. 
7  ¶ Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was 
before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, 
 
and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which 
Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and 
the meat offerings, and the fat. 
8  ¶ Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all 
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of 
Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
9  And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept 
 
the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
