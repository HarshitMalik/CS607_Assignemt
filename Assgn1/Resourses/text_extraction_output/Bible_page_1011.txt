  1012    2 Chronicles 20 
said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in 
 
the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, 
 
so shall ye prosper. 
21  And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers 
unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as 
they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his 
 
mercy endureth for ever. 
22  And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set 
ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount 
Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten. 
 
23  For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the 
inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and 
 
when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one 
helped to destroy another. 
24  Â¶ And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, 
they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies 
fallen to the earth, and none escaped. 
25  And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil 
of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with 
the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for 
themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three 
 
days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 
26  And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of 
Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of 
   
the same place was called, The valley of Berachah [blessing], unto 
this day. 
27  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and 
Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with 
joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 
 
28  And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets 
unto the house of the Lord. 
29  And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, 
when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of 
Israel.
