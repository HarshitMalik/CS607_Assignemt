  2208    Luke 15 
2  And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man 
receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.  
3  ¶ And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 
4  What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, 
doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after 
that which is lost, until he find it? 
 
5  And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
6  And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and 
neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my 
 
sheep which was lost. 
7  I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner 
that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which 
need no repentance. 
The Parable of the Lost Coin 
8  ¶ Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one 
piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek 
diligently till she find it? 
 
9  And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her 
neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the 
 
piece which I had lost. 
10  Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of 
God over one sinner that repenteth. 
The Parable of the Lost Son 
11  ¶ And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
 
12  and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the 
portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his 
living. 
13  And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and 
took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance 
with riotous living.
