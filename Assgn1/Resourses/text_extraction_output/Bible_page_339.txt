  340    Numbers 13 
24  The place was called the brook Eshcol [a cluster of grapes], because 
of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from 
thence. 
25  ¶ And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 
26  And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the 
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, 
to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the 
 
congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
27  And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou 
sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is 
 
the fruit of it. 
28  Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the 
cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children 
 
of Anak there. 
29  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, 
 
and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and 
 
the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 
30  ¶ And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up 
at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
 
31  But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up 
against the people; for they are stronger than we. 
 
32  And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had 
searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through 
which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the 
inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of 
 
a great stature. 
33  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the 
giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we 
 
were in their sight.
