  2224    Luke 20 
20  And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign 
themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so 
they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the

32  Last of all the woman died also. 
33  Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven

34  ¶ And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world 
marry, and are given in marriage:
