  2180    Luke 8 
Jesus’ Mother and Brethren 
19  ¶ Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not 
come at him for the press. 
20  And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy 
brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. 
21  And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren 
are these which hear the word of God, and do it. 
Jesus Calms a Storm 
22  ¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship 
with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the 
 
other side of the lake. And they launched forth. 
23  But as they sailed, he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of 
 
wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in 
 
jeopardy. 
24  And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we 
perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the 
water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
 
25  And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid 
 
wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for 
 
he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. 
The Gadarene Demoniac Healed 
26  ¶ And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over 
against Galilee. 
27  And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a 
certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, 
neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. 
28  When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and 
with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son 
of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
