  1642    Jeremiah 14 
14 
The Message about the Drought 
1  The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the 
dearth. 
2  ¶ Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black 
 
unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
 
3  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came 
 
to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels 
 
empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their 
 
heads. 
4  Because the ground is chapped, for there was no rain in the earth,

6  And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the 
wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. 
 
7  ¶ O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for 
thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned 
   
against thee. 
8  O the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why 
shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man 
that turneth aside to tarry for a night? 
 
9  Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that 
cannot save? yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are 
 
called by thy name; leave us not. 
 
10  ¶ Thus saith the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to 
wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the Lord 
doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and 
 
visit their sins. 
11  Then said the Lord unto me, Pray not for this people for their 
good. 
12  When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer 
 
burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will
