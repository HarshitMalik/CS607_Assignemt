  2475    2 Corinthians 13 
15  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more 
 
abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. 
16  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I 
 
caught you with guile. 
17  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
 
18  I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain 
of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same 
   
steps? 
 
19  ¶ Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak 
 
before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your 
 
edifying. 
20  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, 
and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be 
 
debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, 
swellings, tumults: 
 
21  and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, 
and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have 
not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness 
which they have committed. 
13 
1  This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or 
three witnesses shall every word be established.  
2  I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second 
time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have 
 
sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: 
 
3  since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is 
not weak, but is mighty in you. 
4  For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the 
power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with 
him by the power of God toward you. 
5  ¶ Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own 
 
selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in 
you, except ye be reprobates?
