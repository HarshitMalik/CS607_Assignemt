THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
Asamyataatmanaa yogo dushpraapa iti me matih;
Vashyaatmanaa tu yatataa shakyo’vaaptumupaayatah.
36. I think that Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the
self~controlled and striving one attains to it by the (proper) means.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Ayatih shraddhayopeto yogaacchalitamaanasah;
Apraapya yogasamsiddhim kaam gatim krishna gacchati.
Arjuna said:
37. He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders
away from Yoga, what end does he meet, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, O Krishna?
Kacchinnobhayavibhrashtash cchinnaabhramiva nashyati;
Apratishtho mahaabaaho vimoodho brahmanah pathi.
38. Fallen from both, does he not perish like a rent cloud, supportless, O mighty-armed
(Krishna), deluded on the path of Brahman?
Etanme samshayam krishna cchettumarhasyasheshatah;
Twadanyah samshayasyaasya cchettaa na hyupapadyate.
39. This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou completely dispel, because it is not possible for
any but Thee to dispel this doubt.
COMMENTARY: There is no better teacher than the Lord Himself as He is omniscient.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Paartha naiveha naamutra vinaashas tasya vidyate;
Nahi kalyaanakrit kashchid durgatim taata gacchati.
The Blessed Lord said:
40. O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none,
verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief!
Praapya punyakritaam lokaanushitwaa shaashwateeh samaah;
Shucheenaam shreemataam gehe yogabhrashto’bhijaayate.
41. Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and, having dwelt there for everlasting
years, he who fell from Yoga is reborn in the house of the pure and wealthy.
Athavaa yoginaameva kule bhavati dheemataam;
Etaddhi durlabhataram loke janma yadeedrisham.
