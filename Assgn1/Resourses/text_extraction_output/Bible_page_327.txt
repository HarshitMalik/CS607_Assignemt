  328    Numbers 8 
17  For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and 
beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I 
 
sanctified them for myself.  
18  And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of 
Israel. 
19  And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from 
among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of 
Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an 
atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among 
 
the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto 
the sanctuary. 
20  ¶ And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children 
of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord 
commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of 
Israel unto them. 
21  And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and 
 
Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord; and Aaron 
 
made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 
22  And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the 
tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as 
 
the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did 
they unto them. 
23  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
24  This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years 
 
old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the 
tabernacle of the congregation: 
 
25  and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the 
service thereof, and shall serve no more: 
 
26  but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the 
congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus 
shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
