The Acts of the Apostles 
[Acts] 
1 
The Promise of the Holy Spirit 
1  The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus 
began both to do and teach, 
2  until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the 
Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he 
had chosen: 
 
3  to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many 
infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the 
things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 
 
4  and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that 
they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of 
the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. 
5  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with 
 
the Holy Ghost not many days hence. 
The Ascension 
6  Â¶ When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, 
saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to 
Israel? 
 
7  And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the 
seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. 
8  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon 
you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all 
 
Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  
9  And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was 
taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.  
 
10  And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, 
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
