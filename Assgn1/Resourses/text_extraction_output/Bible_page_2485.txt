  2486    Galatians 6 
The Fruit of the Spirit and the Works of the Flesh 
16  ¶ This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust 
of the flesh. 
17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the 
flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot 
   
do the things that ye would.  
18  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, 
fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
20  idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, 
seditions, heresies, 
21  envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the 
 
which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that 
they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, 
gentleness, goodness, faith, 
23  meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
 
24  And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the 
affections and lusts. 
25  ¶ If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
26  Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying 
one another.

1  Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, 
restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, 
 
lest thou also be tempted. 
2  Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
3  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he 
deceiveth himself. 
4  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have 
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
5  For every man shall bear his own burden.
