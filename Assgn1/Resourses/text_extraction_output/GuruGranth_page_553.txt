Cursed and insipid is that body, O Nanak, which does not know the One who created it.  
|| 1 ||   FIFTH MEHL:  Let His Lotus Feet abide within your heart, and with your tongue, 
chant the Name of the Lord of the World. O Nanak, meditate in remembrance on God, 
and nurture this body of yours.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The Creator Himself is the sixty-eight 
sacred  places  of  pilgrimage;  He  Himself  takes  the  cleansing  bath  there.  He  Himself 
practices austere self-discipline; the Lord and Master Himself inspires us to chant His 
Name. He Himself becomes merciful; the Destroyer of fear Himself gives in charity to 
all. One whom He has enlightened and made Gurmukh, obtains honor forever in His 
Court. One whose honor is preserved by his Lord and Master, comes to know the True 
Lord.  || 14 ||   SHALOK,  THIRD MEHL:  O Nanak, without meeting the True Guru, the 
world is blind; in blindness, it does its deeds. It does not focus its consciousness on the 
Word of the Shabad, which would bring peace to abide in the mind. Always afflicted 
with the dark passions of low energy, it wanders around, passing its days and nights 
burning. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; no one has any say in this.  || 1 ||   
THIRD MEHL:  The True Guru has commanded us to do this: through the Guru‟s Gate, 
meditate on your Lord and Master. The Lord and Master is ever-present. He rips away 
the veil of doubt, and installs His Light deep within. The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial 
Nectar  —  take  this  healing  medicine!  Enshrine  the  Will  of  the  True  Guru  in  your 
consciousness, and make the Love of the True One your self-discipline. O Nanak, you 
shall be kept in peace here, and hereafter you shall celebrate with the Lord.  || 2 ||   
PAUREE:  He Himself is the vast variety of Nature, and He Himself makes it bear fruit. 
He Himself is the Gardener, He Himself irrigates all the plants, and He Himself puts 
them  in  His  mouth.  He  Himself  is  the  Creator,  and  He  Himself  is  the  Enjoyer;  He 
Himself gives, and inspires others to give. He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He 
Himself is the Protector; He Himself is pervading everywhere. Servant Nanak speaks of 
the greatness of the Lord, the Creator, who has no greed at all.  || 15 ||   SHALOK,  
THIRD  MEHL:    One  person  brings  a  full  bottle,  and  another  comes  to  fill  his  cup. 
Drinking it, his intelligence departs, and madness enters his mind. He cannot distinguish 
between his own and others‟ — he is struck down by his Lord and Master. Drinking it, 
he forgets his Lord and Master, and he is punished in the Court of the Lord. Don‟t drink 
the false wine at all, if it is in your power. O Nanak, by His Grace, one obtains the true 
wine, when the True Guru comes and meets him. He shall dwell forever in the Love of 
the Lord and Master, and obtain a seat in the Mansion of His Presence.  || 1 ||   THIRD 
MEHL:  One remains dead while yet alive in this world, when he realizes the Lord. When 
he is put to sleep, he remains asleep; when He is awakened, he regains consciousness. 
O Nanak, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, He causes him to meet the True 
Guru. By Guru‟s Grace, remain dead while yet alive, and you shall not have to die again.  
|| 2 ||   PAUREE:  By His doing, everything happens; what does He care for anyone 
else?
