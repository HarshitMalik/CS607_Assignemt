  1487    Song of Solomon 5 
upon the handles of the lock. 
6  I opened to my beloved; 
 
but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: 
 
my soul failed when he spake: 
 
I sought him, but I could not find him; 
 
I called him, but he gave me no answer. 
7  The watchmen that went about the city found me, 
they smote me, they wounded me; 
 
the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. 
8  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, 
if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, 
that I am sick of love. 
The Bride Praises the Bridegroom 
9  What is thy beloved more than another beloved, 
O thou fairest among women? 
 
What is thy beloved more than another beloved, 
that thou dost so charge us? 
 
10  My beloved is white and ruddy, 
the chiefest among ten thousand. 
11  His head is as the most fine gold; 
 
his locks are bushy, and black as a raven: 
 
12  his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, 
washed with milk, and fitly set: 
 
13  his cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: 
 
his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh: 
 
14  his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: 
 
his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires: 
 
15  his legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: 
 
his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars: 
 
16  his mouth is most sweet: 
 
yea, he is altogether lovely. 
This is my beloved, and this is my friend, 
O daughters of Jerusalem.
