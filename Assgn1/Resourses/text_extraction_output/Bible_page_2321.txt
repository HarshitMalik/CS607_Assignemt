  2322    Acts 7 
The Arrest of Stephen 
8  ¶ And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and 
miracles among the people. 
9  Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the 
synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and 
of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 
10  And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which 
he spake. 
11  Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak 
blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. 
12  And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and 
came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, 
13  and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to 
speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 
 
14  for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy 
this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. 
15  And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his 
face as it had been the face of an angel.

Stephen’s Defense 
1  Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 
 
2  And he said, 
¶ Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared 
 
unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he 
dwelt in Haran, 
3  and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy 
kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.  
4  Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in 
Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed 
 
him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
