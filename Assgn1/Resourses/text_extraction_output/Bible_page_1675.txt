  1676    Jeremiah 29 
19  because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord, 
which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early 
and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the Lord. 
 
20  Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity, 
whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
 
21  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of 
Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie 
unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of 
 
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before 
 
your eyes; 
 
22  and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah 
which are in Babylon, saying, The Lord make thee like Zedekiah 
and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 
 
23  because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have 
committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken 
lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even 
 
I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord. 
24  ¶ Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, 
25  Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because 
thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at 
Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to 
all the priests, saying, 
26  The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, 
that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord, for every man 
that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put 
him in prison, and in the stocks. 
27  Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, 
which maketh himself a prophet to you? 
 
28  For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is 
long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat 
   
the fruit of them. 
29  ¶ And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah 
the prophet. 
30  Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
