  2580    James 4 
The Wisdom from Above 
13  Â¶ Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let 
 
him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of 
wisdom. 
14  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, 
and lie not against the truth. 
15  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, 
devilish. 
16  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil 
work. 
17  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, 
gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, 
without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 
18  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make 
peace. 
4 
Friendship with the World 
1  From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not 
 
hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? 
 
2  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: 
   
ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
3  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume 
it upon your lusts. 
4  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of 
the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend 
 
of the world is the enemy of God. 
5  Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, The spirit that 
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? 
 
6  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, 
God resisteth the proud, 
but giveth grace unto the humble.
