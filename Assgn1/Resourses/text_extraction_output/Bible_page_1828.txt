  1829    Ezekiel 34 
the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that 
be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. 
28  For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength 
shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none 
 
shall pass through. 
29  Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I have laid the 
land most desolate, because of all their abominations which they 
have committed. 
30  Â¶ Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking 
against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak 
one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, 
and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. 
31  And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before 
thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do 
them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart 
 
goeth after their covetousness. 
32  And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a 
pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear 
 
thy words, but they do them not. 
33  And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they 
know that a prophet hath been among them.

The Prophecy against the Shepherds of Israel 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, 
and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds; 
 
Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should 
 
not the shepherds feed the flocks? 
 
3  Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are 
fed: but ye feed not the flock. 
 
4  The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that 
which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken,
