The  power  of  perception  becomes  clearer  with  each
phase, until it is perfectly completed when one attains the
ultimate Way and achieves insight.
Even if you have practiced stabilization for a long time,
if  your  body  and  mind  do  not  have  these  five  times  and
seven phases, you will have a short life in a polluted body,
returning to the void when matter disintegrates. If you then
claim to have insight or to have attained the Way, even if
you  find  it  in  theory  you  are  not  there  in  reality.  This  is
surely mistaken!
