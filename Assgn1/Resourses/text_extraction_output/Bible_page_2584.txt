  2585    1 Peter 1 
11  searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which 
was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings 
of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 
12  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us 
they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by 
them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost 
sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look 
 
into. 
A Call to Holy Living 
13  ¶ Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to 
the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation 
of Jesus Christ; 
 
14  as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the 
former lusts in your ignorance: 
 
15  but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner 
of conversation; 
 
16  because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  
 
17  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth 
according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning 
here in fear: 
 
18  forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible 
things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by 
tradition from your fathers; 
 
19  but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish 
and without spot: 
 
20  who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, 
but was manifest in these last times for you, 
21  who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, 
and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
 
22  ¶ Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through 
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one 
another with a pure heart fervently:
