  867    2 Kings 14 
24  ¶ So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in 
 
his stead. 
25  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-

hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, 
and recovered the cities of Israel.

son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in 
the face. 
9  And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
