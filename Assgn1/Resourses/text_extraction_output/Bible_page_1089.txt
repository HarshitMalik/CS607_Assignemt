Nehemiah Appoints Rulers for Jerusalem 
1  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the 
doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were 
appointed, 
2  that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the 
palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared 
 
God above many. 
3  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened 
until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the 
 
doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of 
 
Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against 
his house. 
4  Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, 
 
and the houses were not builded. 
The List of Returning Exiles 
5  ¶ And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, 
and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by 
genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which 
came up at the first, and found written therein, 
6  ¶ These are the children of the province, that went up out of the 
captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom 
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came 
again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; 
 
7  who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, 
Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, 
Baanah. 
¶ The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this; 
 
8  The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and two. 
9  The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two. 
10  The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.
