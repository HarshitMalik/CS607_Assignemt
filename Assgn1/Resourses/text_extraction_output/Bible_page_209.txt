  210    Exodus 35 
34  But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he 
took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake 
unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 
35  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of 
Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until 
 
he went in to speak with him.

Regulations for the Sabbath 
1  And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel 
together, and said unto them, These are the words which the Lord 
hath commanded, that ye should do them. 
2  Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to 
you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth 
 
work therein shall be put to death.  
3  Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the 
sabbath day. 
Israel to Bring an Offering 
4  ¶ And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of 
Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord commanded, 
saying, 
5  Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: whosoever is 
 
of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, 
 
and silver, and brass, 
6  and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, 
7  and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood, 
8  and oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet 
incense, 
9  and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the 
breastplate.
