  1287    Psalms 68 
great was the company of those that published it. 
12  Kings of armies did flee apace: 
 
and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. 
13  Though ye have lain among the pots, 
yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, 
and her feathers with yellow gold. 
14  When the Almighty scattered kings in it, 
it was white as snow in Salmon. 
15  The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; 
 
a high hill as the hill of Bashan. 
16  Why leap ye, ye high hills? 
 
This is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; 
 
yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. 
17  The chariots of God are twenty thousand, 
even thousands of angels: 
 
the Lord is among them, 
as in Sinai, in the holy place. 
18  Thou hast ascended on high, 
thou hast led captivity captive: 
 
thou hast received gifts for men;  
 
yea, for the rebellious also, 
that the Lord God might dwell among them. 
19  Blessed be the Lord, 
who daily loadeth us with benefits, 
even the God of our salvation. 
Selah. 
20  He that is our God is the God of salvation; 
 
and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death. 
21  But God shall wound the head of his enemies, 
and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 
22  The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, 
I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea: 
 
23  that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, 
and the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 
24  They have seen thy goings, O God;
