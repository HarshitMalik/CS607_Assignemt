  486    Deuteronomy 32 
my speech shall distil as the dew, 
as the small rain upon the tender herb, 
and as the showers upon the grass: 
 
3  because I will publish the name of the Lord: 
 
ascribe ye greatness unto our God. 
4  He is the Rock, his work is perfect: 
 
for all his ways are judgment: 
 
a God of truth and without iniquity, 
just and right is he. 
5  They have corrupted themselves, 
their spot is not the spot of his children: 
 
they are a perverse and crooked generation. 
6  Do ye thus requite the Lord, 
O foolish people and unwise? 
 
Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? 
 
Hath he not made thee, and established thee? 
 
7  Remember the days of old, 
consider the years of many generations: 
 
ask thy father, and he will show thee; 
 
thy elders, and they will tell thee. 
8  When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, 
when he separated the sons of Adam, 
he set the bounds of the people 
according to the number of the children of Israel. 
9  For the Lordâ€™s portion is his people; 
 
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
10  He found him in a desert land, 
and in the waste howling wilderness; 
 
he led him about, he instructed him, 
he kept him as the apple of his eye. 
11  As an eagle stirreth up her nest, 
fluttereth over her young, 
spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, 
beareth them on her wings: 
 
12  so the Lord alone did lead him,
