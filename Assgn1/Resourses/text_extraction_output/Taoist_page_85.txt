nothing to do with knowledge.
When you are about to fall asleep but are not yet asleep,
things  of  the  world  are  not  on  your  mind,  and  you  are
mentally and physically still, this is a time of samadhi.
In the state of cause, this is called stopping and seeing;
in the state of effect, this is called stability and insight.
INSIGHT
It  is  said  that  the  human  mind  is  like  water—when  it  is
clear,  it  reflects  every  detail;  but  once  it  is  disturbed,
heaven and earth switch places.
We should know that there are three paths of insight.
The  first  is  called  insight  into  the  emptiness  of  the
person. This means realizing that there is no birth, no self,
and no person.
The  second  is  called  insight  into  the  emptiness  of
phenomena.  This  means  realizing  that  the  elements  are
conditional, temporary, and not actually real.
The  third  is  called  insight  into  the  emptiness  of
emptiness. This means realizing that cognition and objects
are both empty, and this emptiness is also empty.
When  beginning  to  cultivate  stabilization,  one  may
suddenly  awaken  psychic  powers,  such  as  knowledge  of
the  past,  knowledge  of  the  future,  knowledge  of  others’
minds, or uninhibited eloquence. This is what Confucians
call  the  Way  of  perfect  truthfulness,  by  which
foreknowledge is possible.
