  581    Judges 10 
51  But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the 
men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and 
gat them up to the top of the tower. 
52  And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and 
went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
53  And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s 
head, and all to brake his skull. 
54  Then he called hastily unto the young man his armor-bearer, and 
said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of 
me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, 
and he died. 
55  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they 
departed every man unto his place. 
56  Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did 
unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
 
57  and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their 
heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of 
 
Jerubbaal.

Tola and Jair Judge Israel 
1  And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of 
Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir 
 
in mount Ephraim. 
2  And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was 
buried in Shamir. 
3  ¶ And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty 
and two years. 
4  And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had 
thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day, which are 
in the land of Gilead. 
5  And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
