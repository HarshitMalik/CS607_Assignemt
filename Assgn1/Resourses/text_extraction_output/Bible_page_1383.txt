  1384    Psalms 136 
11  Sihon king of the Amorites, 
and Og king of Bashan, 
and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 
 
12  and gave their land for a heritage, 
a heritage unto Israel his people. 
13  Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; 
 
and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. 
14  For the Lord will judge his people, 
and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 
15  The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, 
the work of men’s hands. 
16  They have mouths, but they speak not; 
 
eyes have they, but they see not; 
 
17  they have ears, but they hear not; 
 
neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
18  They that make them are like unto them: 
 
so is every one that trusteth in them.  
19  Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: 
 
bless the Lord, O house of Aaron: 
 
20  bless the Lord, O house of Levi: 
 
ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. 
21  Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, 
which dwelleth at Jerusalem. 
Praise ye the Lord.
