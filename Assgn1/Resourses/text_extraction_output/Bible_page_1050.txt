the kings of Israel and Judah.

The Reign and Dethronement of Jehoahaz 
1  Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and 
made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem. 
2  Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, 
and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
3  And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned 
the land in a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
4  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah 
and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took 
Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.  
The Reign of Jehoiakim 
5  ¶ Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, 
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was 
 
evil in the sight of the Lord his God. 
6  Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound 
him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
7  Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 
8  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which 
he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written 
in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son 
 
reigned in his stead.
