  2157    Luke 2 
18  And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told 
them by the shepherds. 
19  But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. 
20  And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the 
things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 
The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple 
21  ¶ And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of 
the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the 
angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
22  ¶ And when the days of her purification according to the law of 
Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to 
present him to the Lord; 
 
23  (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the 
womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 
 
24  and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of 
the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  
25  And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was 
Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the 
 
consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
 
26  And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should 
not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
27  And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents 
 
brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
28  then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
29  Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, 
according to thy word: 
 
30  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
31  which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 
 
32  a light to lighten the Gentiles,  
and the glory of thy people Israel. 
33  ¶ And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were 
spoken of him.
