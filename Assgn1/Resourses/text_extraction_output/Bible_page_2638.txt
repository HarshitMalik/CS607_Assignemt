  2639    Revelation 16 
2  ¶ And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them 
 
that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and 
over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of 
glass, having the harps of God. 
3  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song 
of the Lamb, saying, 
Great and marvelous are thy works, 
Lord God Almighty; 
 
just and true are thy ways, 
thou King of saints. 
4  Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?  
 
For thou only art holy: 
 
for all nations shall come and worship before thee;  
 
for thy judgments are made manifest. 
5  ¶ And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle 
of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
 
6  and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven 
plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts 
girded with golden girdles. 
7  And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden 
vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
8  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and 
from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till 
 
the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. 
16 
The Vials of Wrath 
1  And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven 
angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God 
upon the earth. 
2  ¶ And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and 
 
there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the 
mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.
