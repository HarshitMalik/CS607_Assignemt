  2311    Acts 2 
22  ¶ Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man 
 
approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, 
which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also 
know: 
 
23  him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and 
foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have 
crucified and slain:  
 
24  whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: 
 
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 
25  For David speaketh concerning him, 
I foresaw the Lord always before my face; 
 
for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 
 
26  therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; 
 
moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
 
27  because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, 
neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
28  Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; 
 
thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  
29  ¶ Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch 
David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us 
unto this day. 
30  Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with 
an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, 
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  
 
31  he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his 
soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. 
32  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 
33  Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having 
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed 
forth this, which ye now see and hear. 
34  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, 
 
The Lord said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, 
35  until I make thy foes thy footstool.
