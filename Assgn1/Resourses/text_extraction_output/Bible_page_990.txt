  991    2 Chronicles 9 
11  And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the 
Lord, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: 
 
and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. 
12  ¶ And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, 
whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the 
king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her 
servants. 
Solomon’s Riches and Fame 
13  ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six 
hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
 
14  besides that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the 
kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and 
silver to Solomon. 
15  And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six 
 
hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target. 
16  And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred 
 
shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the 
house of the forest of Lebanon. 
17  Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it 
with pure gold. 
18  And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which 
were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting 
place, and two lions standing by the stays: 
 
19  and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon 
the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. 
20  And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all 
the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: 
 
none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of 
 
Solomon. 
21  For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: 
 
every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, 
and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
