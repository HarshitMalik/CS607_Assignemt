10 
Paul’s Defense of His Ministry 
1  Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of 
Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am 
bold toward you: 
 
2  but I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with 
that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which 
think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
 
4  (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through 
God to the pulling down of strongholds;) 
 
5  casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself 
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every 
thought to the obedience of Christ; 
 
6  and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your 
obedience is fulfilled. 
7  ¶ Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man 
 
trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this 
again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s. 
8  For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which 
the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, 
I should not be ashamed: 
 
9  that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
10  For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily 
 
presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. 
11  Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters 
when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are 
present. 
12  For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare 
ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they, 
 
measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves 
among themselves, are not wise.
