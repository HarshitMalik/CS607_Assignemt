  2598    2 Peter 3 
12  looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, 
wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the 
elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
 
13  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens 
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.  
14  Â¶ Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be 
diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and 
blameless. 
15  And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as 
 
our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto 
him hath written unto you; 
 
16  as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which 
 
are some things hard to be understood, which they that are 
unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, 
unto their own destruction. 
17  Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware 
lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from 
your own steadfastness. 
18  But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour 
Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
