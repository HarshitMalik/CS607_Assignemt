26  and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from 
 
Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 
 
27  and in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and

Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of 
Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their
