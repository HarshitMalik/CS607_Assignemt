  1454    Proverbs 29 
15  As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; 
 
so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. 
16  The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: 
 
but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 
17  A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to 
the pit; 
 
let no man stay him. 
18  Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: 
 
but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 
19  He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: 
 
but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 
20  A faithful man shall abound with blessings: 
 
but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. 
21  To have respect of persons is not good: 
 
for, for a piece of bread that man will transgress. 
22  He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, 
and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 
23  He that rebuketh a man, afterward shall find more favor 
than he that flattereth with the tongue. 
24  Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, 
and saith, It is no transgression; 
 
the same is the companion of a destroyer. 
25  He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: 
 
but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat. 
26  He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: 
 
but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 
27  He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: 
 
but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 
28  When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: 
 
but when they perish, the righteous increase. 
29 
1  He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, 
shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
