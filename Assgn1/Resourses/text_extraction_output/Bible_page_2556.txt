  2557    Hebrews 6 
12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that 
one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of 
God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong 
 
meat. 
13  For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of 
righteousness: for he is a babe.  
 
14  But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those 
who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both 
good and evil. 
6 
1  Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go 
on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance 
 
from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
2  of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of 
resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
3  And this will we do, if God permit. 
4  For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have 
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy 
Ghost, 
5  and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world 
to come, 
6  if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing 
 
they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an 
open shame. 
7  For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, 
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, 
receiveth blessing from God: 
 
8  but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh 
unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. 
 
9  Â¶ But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things 
that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
