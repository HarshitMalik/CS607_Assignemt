  772    1 Kings 5 
32  And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a 
 
thousand and five. 
33  And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even 
unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of 
 
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
34  And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from 
all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

Solomon’s Agreement with King Hiram 
1  And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he 
 
had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his 
father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
 
2  And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
3  Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house 
unto the name of the Lord his God, for the wars which were about 
him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his 
feet. 
4  But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that 
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 
5  And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord 
my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, 
whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a 
house unto my name.  
6  Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of 
Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee 
   
will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt 
appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can 
 
skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. 
7  ¶ And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, 
that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, 
which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
