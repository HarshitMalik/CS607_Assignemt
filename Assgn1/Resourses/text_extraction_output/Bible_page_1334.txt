  1335    Psalms 102 
5  Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off: 
 
him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 
6  Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, 
that they may dwell with me: 
 
he that walketh in a perfect way, 
he shall serve me. 
7  He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: 
 
he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 
8  I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; 
 
that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

A Cry in Distress 
A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed,  
and poureth out his complaint before the Lord. 
1  Hear my prayer, O Lord, 
and let my cry come unto thee. 
2  Hide not thy face from me 
in the day when I am in trouble; 
 
incline thine ear unto me: 
 
in the day when I call answer me speedily. 
3  For my days are consumed like smoke, 
and my bones are burned as a hearth. 
4  My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; 
 
so that I forget to eat my bread. 
5  By reason of the voice of my groaning 
my bones cleave to my skin. 
6  I am like a pelican of the wilderness: 
 
I am like an owl of the desert. 
7  I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop. 
8  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; 
 
and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
