  273    Leviticus 19 
30  Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one 
of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, 
and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.

Laws of Holiness and Justice 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say 
unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.  
 
3  Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my 
sabbaths: I am the Lord your God. 
 
4  Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am 
 
the Lord your God. 
5  ¶ And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye 
shall offer it at your own will. 
6  It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if 
 
aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 
7  And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall 
 
not be accepted. 
8  Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he 
hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord; and that soul shall 
 
be cut off from among his people. 
9  ¶ And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly 
reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings 
of thy harvest. 
10  And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather 
every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and 
 
stranger: I am the Lord your God.  
 
11  ¶ Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. 
12  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou 
profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.
