been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Dead but Risen with Christ 
8  ¶ Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain 
deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, 
and not after Christ. 
9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality 
and power: 
 
11  in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made 
without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the 
circumcision of Christ: 
 
12  buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him 
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him 
from the dead.  
13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your 
flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all 
trespasses; 
 
14  blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, 
which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to 
his cross;  
 
15  and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of 
them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
16  ¶ Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect 
of a holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:  
 
17  which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. 
 
18  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and 
worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath 
not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
19  and not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and 
bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, 
increaseth with the increase of God.
