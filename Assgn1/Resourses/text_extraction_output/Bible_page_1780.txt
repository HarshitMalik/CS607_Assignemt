  1781    Ezekiel 16 
6  ¶ And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own 
blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said 
 
unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live. 
7  I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast 
increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent 
ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, 
 
whereas thou wast naked and bare. 
8  ¶ Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy 
time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and 
 
covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a 
 
covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine. 
9  Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy 
 
blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. 
10  I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with 
badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered 
thee with silk. 
11  I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy 
hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
12  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a 
beautiful crown upon thine head. 
13  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of 
 
fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, 
 
and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou 
 
didst prosper into a kingdom. 
14  And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for 
 
it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, 
saith the Lord God. 
15  ¶ But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot 
because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every 
one that passed by; his it was. 
 
16  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places 
with divers colors, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things 
 
shall not come, neither shall it be so.
