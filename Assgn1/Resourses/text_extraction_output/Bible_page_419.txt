  420    Deuteronomy 5 
42  that the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor 
unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto 
 
one of these cities he might live: 
 
43  namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the 
Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in 
   
Bashan, of the Manassites.  
Moses Recounts Israel’s Law 
44  ¶ And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
 
45  these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, 
which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came 
forth out of Egypt, 
46  on this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land 
of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom 
Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth 
out of Egypt: 
 
47  and they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two 
kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the 
sunrising; 
 
48  from Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto 
mount Sion, which is Hermon, 
49  and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of 
the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

The Ten Commandments 
1  And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the 
statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye 
may learn them, and keep and do them. 
2  The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
3  The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, 
even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
