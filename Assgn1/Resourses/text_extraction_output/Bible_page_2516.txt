dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

Paul’s Ministry in Thessalonica 
1  For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it 
was not in vain: 
 
2  but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully 
entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak 
unto you the gospel of God with much contention.  
3  For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in 
guile: 
 
4  but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, 
even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our 
 
hearts. 
5  For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a 
cloak of covetousness; God is witness: 
   
6  nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when 
we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 
7  But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her 
children: 
 
8  so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have 
imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own 
souls, because ye were dear unto us. 
9  ¶ For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for laboring 
 
night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, 
we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
10  Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and 
unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: 
 
11  as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one 
of you, as a father doth his children, 
12  that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his 
kingdom and glory.
