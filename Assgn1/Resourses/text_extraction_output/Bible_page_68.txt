  69    Genesis 30 
26  And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the 
younger before the firstborn. 
27  Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which 
thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
28  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel 
 
his daughter to wife also. 
29  And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be 
her maid. 
30  And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more 
than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
The Children Born to Jacob 
31  ¶ And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her 
womb: but Rachel was barren. 
 
32  And Leah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name 
 
Reuben [see, a son]: for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked 
 
upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. 
 
33  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the 
 
Lord hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this 
son also: and she called his name Simeon [hearing]. 
 
34  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time 
 
will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him 
three sons: therefore was his name called Levi [joined]. 
 
35  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she said, Now will I 
 
praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah [praise]; and 
   
left bearing. 
30 
1  And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel 
envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I 
 
die. 
2  And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in 
 
God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
