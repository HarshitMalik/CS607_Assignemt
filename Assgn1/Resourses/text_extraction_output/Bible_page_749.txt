  750    2 Samuel 22 
but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them 
down. 
29  For thou art my lamp, O Lord: 
 
and the Lord will lighten my darkness. 
30  For by thee I have run through a troop: 
 
by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
31  As for God, his way is perfect; 
 
the word of the Lord is tried: 
 
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. 
32  For who is God, save the Lord? 
 
and who is a rock, save our God? 
 
33  God is my strength and power; 
 
and he maketh my way perfect. 
34  He maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet;  
 
and setteth me upon my high places. 
35  He teacheth my hands to war; 
 
so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
36  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: 
 
and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
37  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; 
 
so that my feet did not slip. 
38  I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; 
 
and turned not again until I had consumed them. 
39  And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could 
not arise: 
 
yea, they are fallen under my feet. 
40  For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: 
 
them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. 
41  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, 
that I might destroy them that hate me. 
42  They looked, but there was none to save; 
 
even unto the Lord, but he answered them not. 
43  Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth: 
 
I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them 
abroad.
