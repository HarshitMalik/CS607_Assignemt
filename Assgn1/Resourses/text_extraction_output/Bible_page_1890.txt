  1891    Daniel 8 
22  until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the 
saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints 
 
possessed the kingdom. 
23  ¶ Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon 
earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour 
the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
24  And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: 
 
and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the 
 
first, and he shall subdue three kings. 
25  And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall 
wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times 
and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and 
 
times and the dividing of time.  
26  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, 
to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
27  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom 
under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints 
of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and 
all dominions shall serve and obey him. 
28  ¶ Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my 
cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in 
me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

Daniel’s Vision of the Ram and the Goat 
1  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared 
unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at 
the first. 
2  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at 
 
Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw 
 
in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
