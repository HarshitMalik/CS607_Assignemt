  1827    Ezekiel 33 
take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; 
 
but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand. 
7  ¶ So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the 
house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, 
 
and warn them from me. 
8  When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if 
 
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked 
man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine 
 
hand. 
9  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if 
 
he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou 
 
hast delivered thy soul. 
God’s Way Is Just 
10  ¶ Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; 
 
Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, 
and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 
 
11  Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in 
the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and 
 
live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O 
   
house of Israel? 
 
12  Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, 
The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day 
of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall 
 
not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; 
 
neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the 
day that he sinneth. 
13  When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he 
 
trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his 
righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that 
 
he hath committed, he shall die for it. 
14  Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn 
 
from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
