  1949    Jonah 3 
5  The waters compassed me about, 
even to the soul: 
 
the depth closed me round about, 
the weeds were wrapped about my head. 
6  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; 
 
the earth with her bars was about me for ever: 
 
yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, 
O Lord my God. 
7  When my soul fainted within me 
I remembered the Lord: 
 
and my prayer came in unto thee, 
into thine holy temple. 
8  They that observe lying vanities 
forsake their own mercy. 
9  But I will sacrifice unto thee 
with the voice of thanksgiving; 
 
I will pay that that I have vowed. 
Salvation is of the Lord. 
10  And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon 
the dry land.

The Repentance of Nineveh 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, 
saying, 
2  Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the 
preaching that I bid thee. 
3  So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of 
the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ 
journey. 
4  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, 
and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
