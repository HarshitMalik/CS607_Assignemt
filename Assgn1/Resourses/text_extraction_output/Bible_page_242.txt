38  which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day 
that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations 
unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.

The Consecration of Aaron and His Sons 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the 
anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and 
a basket of unleavened bread; 
 
3  and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation. 
4  And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly 
 
was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
5  ¶ And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which 
the Lord commanded to be done. 
6  And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with 
water. 
7  And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and 
clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he 
girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto 
him therewith. 
8  And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate 
 
the Urim and the Thummim. 
9  And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon 
 
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the 
 
Lord commanded Moses. 
10  ¶ And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle 
and all that was therein, and sanctified them. 
11  And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed 
the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify 
them.
