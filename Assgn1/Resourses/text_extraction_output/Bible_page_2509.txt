  2510    Colossians 2 
was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I 
 
Paul am made a minister; 
 
24  who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is 
behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, 
which is the church: 
 
25  whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of 
God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; 
 
26  even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from 
generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 
 
27  to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of 
this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope 
 
of glory: 
 
28  whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in 
all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 
   
29  whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which 
worketh in me mightily.

1  For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for 
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the 
flesh; 
 
2  that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, 
and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the 
acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of 
Christ; 
 
3  in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
4  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing 
words. 
5  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, 
joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith 
in Christ. 
6  ¶ As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in 
him:
