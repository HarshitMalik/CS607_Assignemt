  1450    Proverbs 26 
8  As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, 
so is he that giveth honor to a fool. 
9  As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, 
so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 
10  The great God that formed all things 
both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 
11  As a dog returneth to his vomit,  
so a fool returneth to his folly. 
12  Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? 
 
There is more hope of a fool than of him. 
13  The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; 
 
a lion is in the streets. 
14  As the door turneth upon his hinges, 
so doth the slothful upon his bed. 
15  The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; 
 
it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
16  The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit 
than seven men that can render a reason. 
17  He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, 
is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
18  As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 
19  so is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, 
and saith, Am not I in sport? 
 
20  Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: 
 
so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 
21  As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; 
 
so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 
22  The words of a talebearer are as wounds, 
and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 
23  Burning lips and a wicked heart 
are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. 
24  He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, 
and layeth up deceit within him; 
 
25  when he speaketh fair, believe him not: 
 
for there are seven abominations in his heart.
