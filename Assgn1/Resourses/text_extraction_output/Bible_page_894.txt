  895    2 Kings 23 
according to the word of the Lord which the man of God 
proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.  
17  Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city 
 
told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from 
Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the 
altar of Beth-el.  
18  And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let 
 
his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of 
Samaria. 
19  And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of 
Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord 
to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts 
that he had done in Beth-el. 
20  And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon 
the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to 
Jerusalem. 
The Passover Kept 
21  ¶ And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the 
passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of 
this covenant. 
22  Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the 
judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, 
nor of the kings of Judah; 
 
23  but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was 
holden to the Lord in Jerusalem. 
The Lord’s Persistent Anger against Judah 
24  ¶ Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and 
the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied 
in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he 
might perform the words of the law, which were written in the 
book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.
