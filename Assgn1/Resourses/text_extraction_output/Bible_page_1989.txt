  1990    Zechariah 7 
7 
Insincere Fasting Reproved 
1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word 
of the Lord came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth 
month, even in Chisleu; 
 
2  when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-
melech, and their men, to pray before the Lord, 
3  and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the Lord 
of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth 
month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? 
 
4  Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me, saying, 
5  Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, 
When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even 
those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? 
 
6  And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for 
yourselves, and drink for yourselves? 
 
7  Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the 
former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, 
and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the 
south and the plain? 
 
Disobedience the Cause of Captivity 
8  ¶ And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying, 
9  Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, 
and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 
 
10  and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the 
poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your 
 
heart. 
11  But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and 
stopped their ears, that they should not hear. 
12  Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should 
hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in
