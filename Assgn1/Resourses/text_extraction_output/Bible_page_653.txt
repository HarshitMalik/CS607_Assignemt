  654    1 Samuel 15 
22  And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings 
and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey 
 
is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
23  For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as 
iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the 
Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king. 
24  ¶ And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed 
 
the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared 
 
the people, and obeyed their voice. 
25  Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with 
me, that I may worship the Lord. 
26  And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou 
 
hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected 
thee from being king over Israel. 
27  And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt 
of his mantle, and it rent. 
28  And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of 
Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, 
that is better than thou. 
29  And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not 
 
a man, that he should repent. 
30  Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before 
 
the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, 
that I may worship the Lord thy God. 
31  So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord. 
 
32  ¶ Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the 
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, 
Surely the bitterness of death is past. 
33  And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so 
shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed 
Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal. 
34  ¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to 
 
Gibeah of Saul.
