  1411    Proverbs 6 
20  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, 
and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
 
21  For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, 
and he pondereth all his goings. 
22  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, 
and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 
23  He shall die without instruction; 
 
and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

Warning against Idleness and Falsehood 
1  My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, 
if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 
2  thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, 
thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 
3  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, 
when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; 
 
go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
4  Give not sleep to thine eyes, 
nor slumber to thine eyelids. 
5  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, 
and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
6  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; 
 
consider her ways, and be wise: 
 
7  which having no guide, 
overseer, or ruler, 
8  provideth her meat in the summer, 
and gathereth her food in the harvest. 
9  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? 
 
When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 
 
10  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, 
a little folding of the hands to sleep: 
 
11  so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth,
