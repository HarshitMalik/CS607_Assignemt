23  and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be 
 
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a 
Nazarene.

The Preaching of John the Baptist 
1  In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of 
Judea, 
2  and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  
 
3  For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying,

girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 
 
5  Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region 
round about Jordan, 
6  and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. 
7  ¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to 
his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath 
warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
 
8  Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 
 
9  and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our

10  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore 
 
every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and 
cast into the fire.  
11  ¶ I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that 
 
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to 
bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
