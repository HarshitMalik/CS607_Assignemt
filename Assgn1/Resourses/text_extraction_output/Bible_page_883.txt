  884    2 Kings 19 
11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all 
lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 
   
12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have 
destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of 
 
Eden which were in Thelasar? 
 
13  Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king 
of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? 
 
14  ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, 
and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and 
 
spread it before the Lord. 
15  And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of 
Israel, which dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the God, even 
thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made 
 
heaven and earth. 
16  Lord, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and 
 
see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to 
 
reproach the living God. 
17  Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations 
and their lands, 
18  and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the 
 
work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have 
 
destroyed them. 
19  Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out 
of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou 
art the Lord God, even thou only. 
20  ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith 
the Lord God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against 
Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 
21  This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The 
 
virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to 
scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
 
22  ¶ Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom 
 
hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even 
 
against the Holy One of Israel.
