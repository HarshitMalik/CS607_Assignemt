  1036    2 Chronicles 31 
21  And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the 
feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the 
 
Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with 
loud instruments unto the Lord. 
22  And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught 
the good knowledge of the Lord: and they did eat throughout the 
 
feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to 
the Lord God of their fathers. 
23  Â¶ And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: 
 
and they kept other seven days with gladness. 
24  For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand 
bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the 
 
congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a 
 
great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
25  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, 
and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers 
that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, 
rejoiced. 
26  So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon 
 
the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. 
27  Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their 
 
voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling 
place, even unto heaven. 
31 
1  Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went 
out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut 
down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out 
of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until 
they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel 
returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
