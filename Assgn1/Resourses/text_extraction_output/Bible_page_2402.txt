  2403    Romans 7 
6  But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we 
were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the 
 
oldness of the letter. 
The Problem of Indwelling Sin 
7  ¶ What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not 
   
known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law 
 
had said, Thou shalt not covet.  
8  But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all 
manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 
9  For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment 
 
came, sin revived, and I died. 
10  And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be 
unto death. 
11  For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and 
by it slew me. 
12  Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, 
and good. 
13  ¶ Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. 
 
But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that 
which is good; that sin by the commandment might become 
 
exceeding sinful. 
14  For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under 
 
sin. 
15  For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; 
   
but what I hate, that do I.  
16  If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is 
good. 
17  Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
18  For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good 
thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which 
   
is good I find not. 
19  For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, 
 
that I do.
