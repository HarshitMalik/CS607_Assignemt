  280    Leviticus 22 
21  no man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall 
come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire: he hath 
 
a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 
 
22  He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the 
holy. 
23  Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, 
because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for 
   
I the Lord do sanctify them. 
24  And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the 
children of Israel. 
22 
The Holiness of the Offerings 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves 
from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane 
not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am 
 
the Lord. 
3  Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your 
generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of 
Israel hallow unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, 
that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the Lord. 
 
4  What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running 
issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And 
 
whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man 
whose seed goeth from him; 
 
5  or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be 
made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, 
whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 
 
6  the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, 
and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with 
water.
