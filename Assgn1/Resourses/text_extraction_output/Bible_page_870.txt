  871    2 Kings 15 
The Reign of Shallum 
13  ¶ Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth 
year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in 
 
Samaria. 
14  For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to 
Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew 
him, and reigned in his stead. 
15  And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he 
made, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the 
kings of Israel. 
16  Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the 
coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, 
 
therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with 
 
child he ripped up. 
The Reign of Menahem 
17  ¶ In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began 
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years 
in Samaria. 
18  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed 
 
not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who 
made Israel to sin. 
19  And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem 
 
gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with 
him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 
20  And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty 
men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the 
king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not 
there in the land. 
21  And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they 
not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
 
22  And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned 
 
in his stead.
