The General Epistle of 
Jude 
[Jude] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, 
¶ To them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in 
Jesus Christ, and called: 
 
2  ¶ Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. 
Judgment on False Teachers 
3  ¶ Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the 
common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and 
exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was 
once delivered unto the saints. 
4  For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old 
ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of 
our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 
5  ¶ I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew 
this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of 
Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.  
6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own 
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness 
unto the judgment of the great day. 
7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like 
manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after 
strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance 
of eternal fire.  
8  ¶ Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise 
dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
