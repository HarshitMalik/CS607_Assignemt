Solomon’s Apostasy and Adversaries 
1  But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the 
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, 
Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
 
2  of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of 
Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto 
you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: 
   
Solomon clave unto these in love. 
3  And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred 
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
 
4  For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned 
away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with 
 
the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. 
5  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, 
and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
6  And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully 
after the Lord, as did David his father. 
7  Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the 
abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for 
Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
8  And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense 
and sacrificed unto their gods. 
9  ¶ And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was 
turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him 
twice, 
10  and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not 
go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord 
 
commanded. 
11  Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done 
of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, 
which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom 
from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
