  1672    Jeremiah 28 
17  Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: 
   
wherefore should this city be laid waste? 
 
18  But if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, 
let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the 
vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of 
the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. 
19  For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, and 
concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the 
residue of the vessels that remain in this city, 
20  which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried 
away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from 
Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
 
21  yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the 
vessels that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of 
the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; 
 
22  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the 
day that I visit them, saith the Lord; then will I bring them up, 
 
and restore them to this place.

Hananiah’s False Prophecy 
1  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of 
Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, 
that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, 
spake unto me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the 
priests and of all the people, saying, 
2  Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have 
broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
3  Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels 
of the Lord’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took 
away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 
 
4  and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim 
king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into
