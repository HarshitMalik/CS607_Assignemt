  1803    Ezekiel 23 
9  Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the 
hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
10  These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her 
 
daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous 
 
among women; for they had executed judgment upon her. 
 
11  Â¶ And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in 
her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her 
sister in her whoredoms. 
12  She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers 
clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them 
desirable young men. 
13  Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, 
14  and that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men 
 
portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed 
with vermilion, 
15  girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon 
their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the 
Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 
 
16  and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, 
and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 
17  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they 
defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, 
and her mind was alienated from them. 
18  So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: 
 
then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was 
alienated from her sister. 
19  Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the 
days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of 
Egypt. 
20  For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of 
asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
21  Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in 
bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
