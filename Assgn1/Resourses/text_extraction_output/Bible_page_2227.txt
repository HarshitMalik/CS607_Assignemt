  2228    Luke 21 
26  men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those 
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven 
 
shall be shaken. 
27  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with 
power and great glory. 
28  And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift 
up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. 
 
29  ¶ And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the 
 
trees; 
 
30  when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves 
that summer is now nigh at hand. 
31  So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that 
the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 
32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be 
fulfilled. 
33  Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass 
 
away. 
34  ¶ And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be 
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this 
life, and so that day come upon you unawares. 
35  For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the 
whole earth. 
36  Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted 
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to 
stand before the Son of man. 
37  ¶ And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at night 
 
he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of 
Olives. 
38  And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, 
for to hear him.
