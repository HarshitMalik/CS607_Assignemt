  271    Leviticus 18 
18 
Acts of Immorality Forbidden 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the 
Lord your God. 
3  After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not 
do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, 
 
shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 
 
4  Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk 
therein: I am the Lord your God. 
 
5  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a 
 
man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord. 
 
6  ¶ None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to 
uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord. 
 
7  The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt 
thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her 
   
nakedness. 
8  The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy 
 
father’s nakedness.  
9  The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter 
of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even 
their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.  
10  The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, 
even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own 
 
nakedness. 
11  The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy 
father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
12  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is 
 
thy father’s near kinswoman. 
13  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for 
 
she is thy mother’s near kinswoman. 
14  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou 
shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
