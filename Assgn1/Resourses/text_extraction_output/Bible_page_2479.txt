  2480    Galatians 3 
13  And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that 
 
Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. 
14  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the 
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a 
Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why 
compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? 
 
15  We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 
16  knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by 
the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that 
we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of 
the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
 
17  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are 
found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. 
 
18  For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a 
transgressor. 
19  For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto 
God. 
20  I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ 
   
liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the 
 
faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
21  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the 
 
law, then Christ is dead in vain.

The Spirit Received through Faith 
1  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not 
obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently 
set forth, crucified among you? 
 
2  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works 
of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
 
3  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made 
 
perfect by the flesh? 
 
4  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
