to become fishers of men. 
18  And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
19  And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son 
of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship 
mending their nets. 
20  And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee 
 
in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

that had authority, and not as the scribes.
