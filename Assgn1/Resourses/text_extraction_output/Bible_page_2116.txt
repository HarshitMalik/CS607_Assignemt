  2117    Mark 7 
15  there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can 
defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they 
 
that defile the man. 
16  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
17  And when he was entered into the house from the people, his 
disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
18  And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do 
 
ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into 
the man, it cannot defile him; 
 
19  because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth 
out into the draught, purging all meats? 
 
20  And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the 
man. 
21  For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, 
adulteries, fornications, murders, 
22  thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, 
blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 
 
23  all these evil things come from within, and defile the man. 
The Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith 
24  ¶ And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and 
Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know it: 
 
but he could not be hid. 
25  For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, 
heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 
 
26  the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation; and she 
 
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her 
daughter. 
27  But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not 
 
meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. 
28  And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under 
 
the table eat of the children’s crumbs. 
29  And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone 
 
out of thy daughter.
