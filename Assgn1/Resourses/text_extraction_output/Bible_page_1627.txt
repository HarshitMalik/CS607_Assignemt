  1628    Jeremiah 7 
25  Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt 
unto this day, I have even sent unto you all my servants the 
prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 
 
26  yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but 
hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers. 
 
27  ¶ Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they 
 
will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they 
   
will not answer thee. 
28  But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the 
voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is 
 
perished, and is cut off from their mouth. 
29  ¶ Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a 
lamentation on high places; for the Lord hath rejected and 
 
forsaken the generation of his wrath. 
30  ¶ For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the 
Lord: they have set their abominations in the house which is 
 
called by my name, to pollute it. 
31  And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley 
of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the 
fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. 
 
32  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no 
more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but 
The valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be 
 
no place. 
33  And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the 
heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them 
 
away. 
34  Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the 
streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, 
the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land 
 
shall be desolate.
