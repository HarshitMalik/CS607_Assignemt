  2367    Acts 21 
3  Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, 
and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to 
 
unlade her burden. 
4  And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul 
 
through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 
5  And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went 
our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and 
 
children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the 
 
shore, and prayed. 
6  And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; 
 
and they returned home again. 
7  ¶ And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to 
Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. 
8  And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and 
came unto Caesarea; and we entered into the house of Philip the 
 
evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. 
 
9  And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did 
prophesy. 
10  And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea a 
certain prophet, named Agabus.  
11  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound 
his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So 
shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, 
and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. 
12  And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, 
besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
13  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine 
heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at 
 
Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
14  And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will 
of the Lord be done. 
15  ¶ And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to 
Jerusalem.
