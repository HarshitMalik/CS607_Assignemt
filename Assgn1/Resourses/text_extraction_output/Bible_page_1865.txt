  1866    Ezekiel 48 
48 
1  Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the 
coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-enan, 
the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for 
 
these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan. 
 
2  And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a 
portion for Asher. 
3  And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west 
side, a portion for Naphtali. 
4  And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west 
side, a portion for Manasseh. 
5  And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west 
side, a portion for Ephraim. 
6  And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the 
west side, a portion for Reuben. 
7  And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, 
a portion for Judah. 
8  Â¶ And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, 
shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty 
thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, 
from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in 
 
the midst of it. 
9  The oblation that ye shall offer unto the Lord shall be of five and 
twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth. 
10  And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; 
 
toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward 
the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand 
in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in 
length: and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst 
 
thereof. 
11  It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; 
 
which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the 
children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
