  641    1 Samuel 11 
23  And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among 
 
the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders 
and upward. 
24  And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord 
hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And 
 
all the people shouted, and said, God save the king. 
25  ¶ Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and 
wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent 
all the people away, every man to his house. 
26  And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a 
 
band of men, whose hearts God had touched. 
27  But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And 
 
they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his 
peace.

Saul Defeats the Ammonites 
1  Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against 
Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a 
 
covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
2  And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I 
make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, 
and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel. 
3  And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, 
that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, 
 
if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee. 
4  Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings 
in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, 
 
and wept. 
5  ¶ And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field: and Saul 
 
said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the 
 
tidings of the men of Jabesh.
