  2384    Acts 27 
11  Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of 
the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. 
12  And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more 
part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might

22  And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss 
 
of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.
