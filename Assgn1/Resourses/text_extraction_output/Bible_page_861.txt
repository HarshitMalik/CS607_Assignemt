  862    2 Kings 12 
all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and 
 
Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason. 
15  But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, 
the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without 
the ranges; and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the 
 
priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord. 
16  And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which 
 
the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain. 
 
17  ¶ And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king 
and the people, that they should be the Lord’s people; between 
 
the king also and the people. 
18  And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and 
brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces 
 
thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord. 
19  And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the 
guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the 
 
king from the house of the Lord, and came by the way of the gate 
of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the 
kings. 
20  And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: 
 
and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s house. 
21  ¶ Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign. 
12 
The Reign of Jehoash of Judah 
1  In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; and forty years 
 
reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zibiah of 
Beer-sheba. 
2  And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his 
days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
3  But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed 
 
and burnt incense in the high places.
