  1654    Jeremiah 20 
13  and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, 
shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses 
upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of 
heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. 
14  ¶ Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord had sent 
him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord’s house, 
 
and said to all the people, 
15  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will 
 
bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have 
pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, 
that they might not hear my words.

The Curse on Pashur for Imprisoning Jeremiah 
1  Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief 
governor in the house of the Lord, heard that Jeremiah

2  Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the 
stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the 
house of the Lord. 
3  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth 
Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The 
Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib [fear 
round about]. 
4  For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to 
thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of 
 
their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all 
 
Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them 
captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. 
5  Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the 
labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the 
treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
