  1881    Daniel 4 
17  This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the 
word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that 
 
the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to 
whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. 
18  This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O 
Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all 
the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me 
the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods 
   
is in thee. 
19  Â¶ Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for 
one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, 
Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, 
trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream 
be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine 
enemies. 
20  The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose 
height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the 
earth; 
 
21  whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was 
meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon 
 
whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 
 
22  it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy 
 
greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to 
the end of the earth. 
23  And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down 
from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet 
 
leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band 
of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet 
 
with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the 
field, till seven times pass over him; 
 
24  this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most 
High, which is come upon my lord the king: 
 
25  that they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with 
the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, 
and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times
