  1440    Proverbs 21 
he receiveth knowledge. 
12  The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: 
 
but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. 
13  Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, 
he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 
14  A gift in secret pacifieth anger: 
 
and a reward in the bosom, strong wrath. 
15  It is joy to the just to do judgment: 
 
but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. 
16  The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding 
shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 
17  He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: 
 
he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 
18  The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, 
and the transgressor for the upright. 
19  It is better to dwell in the wilderness, 
than with a contentious and an angry woman. 
20  There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; 
 
but a foolish man spendeth it up. 
21  He that followeth after righteousness and mercy 
findeth life, righteousness, and honor. 
22  A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, 
and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 
23  Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, 
keepeth his soul from troubles. 
24  Proud and haughty scorner is his name, 
who dealeth in proud wrath. 
25  The desire of the slothful killeth him; 
 
for his hands refuse to labor. 
26  He coveteth greedily all the day long: 
 
but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 
27  The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: 
 
how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 
 
28  A false witness shall perish: 
 
but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
