  728    2 Samuel 15 
15 
Absalom Revolts against David 
1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots 
and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
2  And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: 
 
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to 
the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of 
what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes 
 
of Israel. 
3  And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; 
 
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. 
4  Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, 
that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, 
and I would do him justice! 
 
5  And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him 
obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. 
6  And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king 
for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
 
7  Â¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the 
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed 
unto the Lord, in Hebron. 
8  For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, 
saying, If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then 
I will serve the Lord. 
9  And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to 
Hebron. 
10  But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, 
As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, 
Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
11  And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that 
were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not 
 
any thing.
