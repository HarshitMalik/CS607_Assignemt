29  ¶ And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, 
and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they 
came to Mahanaim. 
30  And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had 
 
gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants 
nineteen men and Asahel. 
31  But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s 
men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. 
32  And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his 
father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all 
night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
