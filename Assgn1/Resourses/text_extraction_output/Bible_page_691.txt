  692    1 Samuel 31 
23  Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which 
the Lord hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the 
company that came against us into our hand. 
24  For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that 
 
goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the 
stuff: they shall part alike. 
 
25  And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and 
an ordinance for Israel unto this day. 
26  ¶ And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the 
elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you 
of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord; 
 
27  to them which were in Beth-el, and to them which were in south 
Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir, 
28  and to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in 
Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 
29  and to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the 
cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of 
the Kenites, 
30  and to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in 
Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach, 
31  and to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where 
David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

The Death of Saul and His Sons 
1  Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled 
 
from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 
2  And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; 
 
and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, 
Saul’s sons. 
3  And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and 
 
he was sore wounded of the archers.
