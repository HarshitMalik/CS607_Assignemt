  173    Exodus 21 
4  If his master have given him a wife, and she have borne him sons or 
daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he 
 
shall go out by himself. 
5  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and 
my children; I will not go out free: 
   
6  then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring 
 
him to the door, or unto the doorpost; and his master shall bore his 
 
ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.  
 
7  ¶ And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not 
go out as the menservants do. 
8  If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, 
then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation 
 
he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 
9  And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her 
after the manner of daughters. 
10  If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of 
marriage, shall he not diminish. 
11  And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free 
without money. 
Laws concerning Acts of Violence 
12  ¶ He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.  
13  And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; 
 
then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.  
14  But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him 
with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. 
 
15  ¶ And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put 
to death. 
16  ¶ And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in 
his hand, he shall surely be put to death.  
17  ¶ And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put 
to death.  
18  ¶ And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, 
or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:
