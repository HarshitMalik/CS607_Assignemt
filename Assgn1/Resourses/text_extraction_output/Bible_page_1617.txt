  1618    Jeremiah 4 
25  We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we 
 
have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from 
our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the 
Lord our God. 
4 
1  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me: and if 
 
thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt 
thou not remove. 
2  And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and 
in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and 
 
in him shall they glory. 
3  ¶ For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, 
Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 
4  Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of 
your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my 
 
fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because 
of the evil of your doings. 
Judah Threatened with Invasion 
5  ¶ Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye 
 
the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble 
 
yourselves, and let us go into the defensed cities. 
6  Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not; for I will bring 
   
evil from the north, and a great destruction. 
7  The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the 
Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy 
 
land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an 
 
inhabitant. 
8  For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce 
 
anger of the Lord is not turned back from us.
