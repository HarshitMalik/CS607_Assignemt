  2507    Philippians 4 
11  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in 
 
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 
12  I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every 
 
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be 
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
13  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
14  ¶ Notwithstanding, ye have well done, that ye did communicate 
with my affliction. 
15  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, 
when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with 
me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
16  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.  
17  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to 
 
your account. 
18  But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of 
 
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a 
sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. 
19  But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in 
glory by Christ Jesus. 
20  Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
Final Greetings 
21  ¶ Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with 
me greet you. 
22  All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s 
household. 
23  ¶ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
