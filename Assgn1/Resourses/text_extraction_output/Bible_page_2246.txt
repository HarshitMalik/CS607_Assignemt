  2247    John 3 
19  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in 
three days I will raise it up.  
20  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, 
and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 
 
21  But he spake of the temple of his body. 
22  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples 
remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the 
 
Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 
Jesus Knows All Men 
23  ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, 
many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he 
did. 
24  But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all 
men, 
25  and needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what 
 
was in man.

Jesus and Nicodemus 
1  There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the 
Jews: 
 
2  the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we 
know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do 
 
these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is 
old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be 
 
born? 
 
5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born 
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
