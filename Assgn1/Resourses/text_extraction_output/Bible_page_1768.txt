  1769    Ezekiel 10 
10 
God’s Glory Departs from the Temple 
1  Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the 
head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a 
sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.  
2  And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in 
between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand 
with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over 
the city.  
¶ And he went in in my sight. 
3  Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the 
man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
 
4  Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and stood 
over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the 
 
cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory. 
5  And the sound of the cherubim’s wings was heard even to the outer 
court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. 
6  ¶ And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man 
clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, 
from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the 
 
wheels. 
7  And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the 
cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took 
thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen; 
 
who took it, and went out. 
8  And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand 
under their wings. 
9  ¶ And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one 
wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and 
 
the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone. 
10  And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a 
wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
