  63    Genesis 27 
22  And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and 
 
said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
23  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his 
brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him. 
 
24  And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
 
25  And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, 
that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he 
did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
 
26  And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, 
my son. 
27  And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his 
 
raiment, and blessed him, and said, 
See, the smell of my son 
is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed: 
 
28  therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, 
and the fatness of the earth, 
and plenty of corn and wine: 
 
29  let people serve thee, 
and nations bow down to thee: 
 
be lord over thy brethren, 
and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: 
 
cursed be every one that curseth thee, 
and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  
30  ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing 
Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac 
his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
31  And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, 
and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s 
venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
32  And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I 
 
am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau. 
33  And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he 
 
that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all 
before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be 
 
blessed.
