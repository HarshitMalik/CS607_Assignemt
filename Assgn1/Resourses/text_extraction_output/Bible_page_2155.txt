  2156    Luke 2 
4  And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, 
into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, 
(because he was of the house and lineage of David,) 
5  to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
6  And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were 
accomplished that she should be delivered. 
7  And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in 
swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no 
 
room for them in the inn. 
The Shepherds and the Angels 
8  ¶ And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the 
field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
9  And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the 
Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. 
 
10  And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you 
 
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
11  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is 
Christ the Lord. 
12  And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in 
 
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
13  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly 
host praising God, and saying, 
14  Glory to God in the highest, 
and on earth peace, 
good will toward men. 
15  ¶ And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into 
heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto 
Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the 
Lord hath made known unto us. 
16  And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the 
babe lying in a manger. 
17  And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying 
which was told them concerning this child.
