  791    1 Kings 10 
9  Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee 
on the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel for ever, 
 
therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. 
10  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of 
spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more 
 
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to 
king Solomon. 
11  ¶ And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, 
brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious 
stones. 
12  And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the 
Lord, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for 
singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this 
 
day. 
13  ¶ And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, 
whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his 
royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and 
her servants. 
Solomon’s Riches and Fame 
14  ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six 
hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
15  besides that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the 
spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the 
governors of the country. 
16  And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six 
 
hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 
17  And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of 
 
gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the 
 
forest of Lebanon. 
18  Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it 
with the best gold.
