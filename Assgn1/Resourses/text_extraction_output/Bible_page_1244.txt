  1245    Psalms 37 
5  Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; 
 
and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. 
6  Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; 
 
thy judgments are a great deep: 
 
O Lord, thou preservest man and beast. 
7  How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God! 
 
Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of 
thy wings. 
8  They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; 
 
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
9  For with thee is the fountain of life: 
 
in thy light shall we see light. 
10  O continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee; 
 
and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
11  Let not the foot of pride come against me, 
and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. 
12  There are the workers of iniquity fallen: 
 
they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. 
37 
The Insecurity of the Wicked 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Fret not thyself because of evildoers, 
neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
2  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, 
and wither as the green herb. 
3  Trust in the Lord, and do good; 
 
so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. 
4  Delight thyself also in the Lord; 
 
and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. 
5  Commit thy way unto the Lord; 
 
trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
