  45    Genesis 21 
2  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the 
set time of which God had spoken to him. 
3  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, 
whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
4  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as 
God had commanded him. 
5  And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was 
born unto him. 
6  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear 
will laugh with me. 
7  And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah 
should have given children suck? for I have borne him a son in his 
 
old age. 
Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away 
8  ¶ And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great 
 
feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. 
9  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne 
unto Abraham, mocking. 
10  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and 
her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my 
 
son, even with Isaac.  
11  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his 
son. 
12  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight 
because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah 
 
hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy 
 
seed be called.  
13  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, 
because he is thy seed. 
14  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a 
bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, 
and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered 
 
in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
