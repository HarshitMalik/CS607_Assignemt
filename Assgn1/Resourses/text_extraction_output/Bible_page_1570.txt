  1571    Isaiah 44 
2  thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the 
womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and 
   
thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. 
3  For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the 
dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing 
 
upon thine offspring: 
 
4  and they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the 
watercourses. 
5  One shall say, I am the Lord’s; and another shall call himself by the 
 
name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the 
 
Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel. 
6  ¶ Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the 
Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there 
   
is no God. 
7  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for 
me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are 
 
coming, and shall come, let them show unto them. 
8  Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, 
 
and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God 
 
besides me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. 
   
The Folly of Idolatry 
9  ¶ They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their 
 
delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; 
   
they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 
 
10  Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable 
for nothing? 
 
11  Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen, they 
 
are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet 
   
they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together. 
12  ¶ The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and 
fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of 
his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no 
   
water, and is faint.
