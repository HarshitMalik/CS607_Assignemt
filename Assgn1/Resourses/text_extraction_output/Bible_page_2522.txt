The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the 
Thessalonians 
[2 Thessalonians] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, 
¶ Unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the 
Lord Jesus Christ: 
 
2  ¶ Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
Judgment at Christ’s Coming 
3  ¶ We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is 
meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity 
of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
 
4  so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your 
patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye 
endure: 
 
5  which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye 
may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also 
suffer: 
 
6  seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to 
them that trouble you; 
 
7  and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall 
be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
8  in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and 
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
 
9  who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the 
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
