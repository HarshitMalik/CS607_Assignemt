  1826    Ezekiel 33 
28  Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and 
shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword. 
29  ¶ There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their 
might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie 
 
with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. 
30  ¶ There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the 
Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror 
 
they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with 
 
them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them 
that go down to the pit. 
31  ¶ Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his 
multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith 
the Lord God. 
32  For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be 
 
laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with 
the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.

The Watchman’s Duty 
1  Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, 
When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take 
a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: 
 
3  if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the 
trumpet, and warn the people; 
 
4  then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not 
warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be 
 
upon his own head. 
5  He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his 
 
blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver 
his soul. 
6  But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the 
trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and
