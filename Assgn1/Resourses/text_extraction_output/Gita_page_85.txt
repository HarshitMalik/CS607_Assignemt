THE YOGA OF THE IMPERISHABLE BRAHMAN
9. Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the ruler (of the whole world),
minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond
the darkness of ignorance,
Prayaanakaale manasaachalena
Bhaktyaa yukto yogabalena chaiva;
Bhruvormadhye praanamaaveshya samyak
Sa tam param purusham upaiti divyam.
10. At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotion and by the power of
Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyebrows, he reaches that resplendent
Supreme Person.
Yadaksharam vedavido vadanti
Vishanti yadyatayo veetaraagaah;
Yadicchanto brahmacharyam charanti
Tatte padam samgrahena pravakshye.
11. That which is declared imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the
self-controlled (ascetics) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised—that
goal I will declare to thee in brief.
Sarvadwaaraani samyamya mano hridi nirudhya cha;
Moordhnyaadhaayaatmanah praanamaasthito yogadhaaranaam.
12. Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the
head, engaged in the practice of concentration,
Omityekaaksharam brahma vyaaharan maamanusmaran;
Yah prayaati tyajan deham sa yaati paramaam gatim.
13. Uttering the monosyllable Om—the Brahman—remembering Me always, he who
departs thus, leaving the body, attains to the supreme goal.
Ananyachetaah satatam yo maam smarati nityashah;
Tasyaaham sulabhah paartha nityayuktasya yoginah.
14. I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers
Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single or one-pointed mind), O Partha
(Arjuna)!
COMMENTARY: Constantly remembering the Lord throughout one’s life is the easiest
way of attaining Him.
Maamupetya punarjanma duhkhaalayamashaashwatam;
Naapnuvanti mahaatmaanah samsiddhim paramaam gataah.
