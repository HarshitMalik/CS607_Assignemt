9 
The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon 
1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she 
came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a 
very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in 
abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to 
 
Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
2  And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid 
 
from Solomon which he told her not. 
3  And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, 
and the house that he had built, 
4  and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the 
attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, 
 
and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the 
 
house of the Lord; there was no more spirit in her. 
 
5  ¶ And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in 
mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 
 
6  howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had 
seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom 
 
was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard. 
 
7  Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand 
continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 
8  Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee 
on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God: because thy God 
 
loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king 
over them, to do judgment and justice. 
9  And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of 
spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any 
 
such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon. 
10  ¶ And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, 
which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious 
stones.
