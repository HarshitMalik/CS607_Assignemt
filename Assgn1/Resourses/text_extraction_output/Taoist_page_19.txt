you  can  just  nurture  the  real  human  being,  this  will  be
better than a pauper obtaining ten thousand pieces of gold.
Mencius  said,  “The  difference  between  humans  and
animals  is  slight;  common  people  obliterate  it,  superior
people  maintain  it.  Those  who  maintain  it  become  sages;
those  who  obliterate  it  become  beasts.”  When  they
obliterate  it,  they  turn  into  beasts  right  away,  not  in
another life after death.
Nature  has  five  forces—metal,  wood,  water,  fire,  and
earth. They are called forces because they never cease; if
they  ceased  for  even  a  while,  they  could  not  be  called
forces.  Humanity  has  five  constants.  They  are  called
constants  because  they  are  invariable;  if  they  varied  for
even a moment, they could not be called constants.
These five forces and five constants are inherent in the
human  body,  where  they  constitute  five  organs—heart,
liver, pancreas, lungs, and kidneys. The five organs are the
main  root  giving  life  to  people;  if  this  main  root  is
damaged,  it  cannot  sustain  life.  Therefore  when
enlightened  physicians  treat  disease,  they  invariably
harmonize the five organs first.
When  the  five  forces  operate  in  the  course  of  daily
activities,  they  constitute  the  five  norms.  The  five  norms
are  the  relationship  between  government  and  people,
between parents and children, between husband and wife,
between older and younger siblings, and between friends.
The five norms are the path of success for people; if they
neglect  this  way  of  success,  they  cannot  be  human.
