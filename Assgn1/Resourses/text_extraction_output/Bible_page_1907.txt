  1908    Hosea 3 
23  And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy 
 
upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which 
 
were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou 
 
art my God.

Hosea and the Adulteress 
1  Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her 
friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward 
the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of 
wine. 
2  So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of 
barley, and a half homer of barley: 
 
3  and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt 
 
not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I 
 
also be for thee. 
4  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and 
without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, 
and without an ephod, and without teraphim: 
 
5  afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord 
their God, and David their king; and shall fear the Lord and his 
 
goodness in the latter days.

The Lordâ€™s Controversy with Israel 
1  Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord 
 
hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is 
no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 
2  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing 
adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
