“breathing from the heels” as realized people do.
Therefore  it  is  said,  “Stay  leisurely  by  the  medicine
stove  to  watch  the  firing  process;  just  calm  mind  and
breath and leave it to nature.”
The  whole  human  body  is  an  energy  circuit.  When
energy  flows  freely  we  feel  good,  and  when  energy  is
blocked we get sick.
So  dance  around  to  nourish  the  energy  of  the  blood.
This  method  can  be  practiced  anytime,  at  one’s
convenience.
It  is  essential  to  unify  the  mind  and  stop  the  breath  so
the spirit is pervasive, the energy is full, and energy flows
easily.
Then glare and grit your teeth, be stern and strong, and
false thoughts will spontaneously vanish.
Do this several times and then sit quietly, and it is most
effective at getting rid of confusion and dissolving illness.
This exercise has great benefit and should not be slighted.
VITALITY
Realized  people  refine  vitality  into  energy;  in  ordinary
people,  energy  turns  into  vitality.  Ancients  compared  this
to  quicksilver,  meaning  that  it  runs  off  very  easily;  and
they  symbolized  it  by  the  dragon,  meaning  that  it  is
extremely  difficult  to  subdue.  Those  who  learn  the  Way
guard  it  rigorously  and  do  not  lose  it;  that  is  called
building the foundation.
