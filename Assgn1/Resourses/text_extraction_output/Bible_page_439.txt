  440    Deuteronomy 13 
24  Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.  
 
25  Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy 
 
children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the 
sight of the Lord. 
26  Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt 
take, and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose: 
 
27  and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, 
upon the altar of the Lord thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices 
 
shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord thy God, and thou 
shalt eat the flesh. 
28  Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it 
may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, 
when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the 
Lord thy God. 
Warning against Idolatry 
29  ¶ When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before 
thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest 
them, and dwellest in their land; 
 
30  take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, 
after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire 
 
not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their 
gods? even so will I do likewise. 
 
31  Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every 
 
abomination to the Lord which he hateth have they done unto 
their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt 
 
in the fire to their gods. 
32  ¶ What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt 
 
not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
