  1019    2 Chronicles 24 
19  And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that 
none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. 
20  And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the 
governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought 
down the king from the house of the Lord: and they came through 
 
the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the 
throne of the kingdom. 
21  And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after 
 
that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

The Reign of Joash of Judah 
1  Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 
forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of 
Beer-sheba. 
2  And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the 
days of Jehoiada the priest. 
3  And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and 
 
daughters. 
4  ¶ And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the 
house of the Lord. 
5  And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to 
them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel 
money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see 
that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. 
6  And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why 
hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and 
out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of 
Moses the servant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Israel, 
for the tabernacle of witness?  
 
7  For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the 
house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the 
 
Lord did they bestow upon Baalim.
