permanently cancel awareness and enter into blind trance.
If you just let your mind be aroused without collecting or
controlling it at all, then you are after all no different from
an ordinary mortal.
As  for  those  who  simply  stop  the  mind,  good  or  bad,
without any direction, letting their ideas float and wander
while  waiting  for  them  to  settle  of  themselves,  they  are
vainly misleading themselves.
As  for  those  who  carry  on  all  manner  of  affairs  while
claiming  their  minds  are  unaffected,  they  talk  very  well
but their behavior is quite wrong. Genuine students should
be particularly wary of this.
Now  then,  stop  confusion  without  extinguishing
awareness;  keep  calm  without  clinging  to  emptiness.
Practice  this  regularly  and  you  will  naturally  attain  true
vision.  If  there  are  current  matters  or  essentials  of  the
teaching about which you have doubts, then you may think
about them to get the matter settled, so that you understand
what  you  had  wondered  about.  This  too  is  a  proper  basis
for developing wisdom.
Once you have understood, have no further thoughts. If
you  keep  thinking,  you  will  ruin  your  serenity  by  your
intelligence—you will “diminish the principal on account
of the interest.” Even if you exercise temporary brilliance,
you will fail to achieve a lasting accomplishment.
