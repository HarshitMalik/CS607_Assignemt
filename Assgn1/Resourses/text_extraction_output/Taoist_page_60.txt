are  a  variety  of  states,  but  after  awakening,  they  are
empty; there is no universe.”
The  mountains,  rivers,  and  land  are  all  scenes  in
dreams; kings, lords, generals, and ministers are all people
in  dreams.  The  scriptures  and  classics  of  Confucianism,
Taoism,  and  Buddhism  are  all  books  for  interpreting
dreams.
In  ancient  times  someone  asked  a  master  about  his
sleep:  “In  a  single  sleep  you  take  in  the  primordial
wholeness  of  the  universe;  when  you  wake  up  you  break
through  the  going  and  coming  of  past  and  present.
Marvelous! Is there also a Way of sleep?”
He said, “There is a Way. When ordinary people sleep,
they first let their eyes go to sleep, then their minds. When
I sleep, I first let my mind go to sleep, then my eyes.
“When I wake up, first I wake my eyes, then my mind.
By wakefulness of eye, I see mind; when mind awakens, I
do not see the world.
“When I do not see the world, neither do I see mind. I
sleep mindlessly and awaken without minding.”
The  questioner  asked,  “If  I  want  to  learn  to  be
unminding, how can I do so?”
The  master  replied,  “Don’t  notice  mind  when  dealing
with  objects,  and  don’t  notice  objects  when  dealing  with
mind.
“This is all I know—how could I know anything else?
When you wake up, there’s nothing to know; the more you
know, the more tired the mind.”
