  2333    Acts 9 
33  And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept 
his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
34  And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: 
 
arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
35  And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the 
Lord. 
Dorcas Restored to Life 
36  Â¶ Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which 
by interpretation is called Dorcas [doe, or roe]: this woman was full 
 
of good works and almsdeeds which she did. 
37  And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: 
 
whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
38  And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had 
heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring 
him that he would not delay to come to them. 
39  Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they 
brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by 
 
him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas 
made, while she was with them. 
40  But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and 
 
turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her 
eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
 
41  And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up; and when he had called 
 
the saints and widows, he presented her alive. 
42  And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the 
 
Lord. 
43  And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one 
Simon a tanner.
