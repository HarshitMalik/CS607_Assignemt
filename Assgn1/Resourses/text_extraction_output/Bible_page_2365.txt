  2366    Acts 21 
28  Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the 
which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church 
of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 
29  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter 
in among you, not sparing the flock. 
30  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, 
to draw away disciples after them. 
31  Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I 
ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 
32  And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his 
grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance 
among all them which are sanctified. 
33  I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel. 
34  Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my 
necessities, and to them that were with me. 
35  I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to 
support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, 
how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 
36  ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed 
with them all. 
37  And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him, 
38  sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they 
should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the 
ship.

Paul’s Journey to Jerusalem 
1  And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had 
launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day 
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 
 
2  and finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, 
and set forth.
