  629    1 Samuel 5 
18  And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that 
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his 
neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he 
 
had judged Israel forty years. 
19  ¶ And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to 
be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God 
 
was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, 
she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. 
 
20  And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said 
unto her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered 
 
not, neither did she regard it. 
21  And she named the child Ichabod [there is no glory], saying, The 
glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and 
 
because of her father-in-law and her husband. 
22  And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God 
 
is taken.

The Ark in the Land of the Philistines 
1  And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from 
Ebenezer unto Ashdod. 
2  When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the 
house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 
3  And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, 
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the 
Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. 
4  And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, 
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the 
Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were 
 
cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. 
 
5  Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into 
Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto 
this day.
