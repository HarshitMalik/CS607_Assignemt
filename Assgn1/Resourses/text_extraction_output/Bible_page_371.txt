  372    Numbers 24 
14  And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will 
 
advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter 
days. 
15  And he took up his parable, and said, 
Balaam the son of Beor hath said, 
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
 
16  he hath said, which heard the words of God, 
and knew the knowledge of the Most High, 
which saw the vision of the Almighty, 
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
 
17  I shall see him, but not now: 
 
I shall behold him, but not nigh: 
 
there shall come a Star out of Jacob, 
and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, 
and shall smite the corners of Moab, 
and destroy all the children of Sheth. 
18  And Edom shall be a possession, 
Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; 
 
and Israel shall do valiantly. 
19  Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, 
and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. 
20  ¶ And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, 
Amalek was the first of the nations; 
 
but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever. 
21  ¶ And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, 
Strong is thy dwelling place, 
and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. 
22  Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, 
until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. 
23  ¶ And he took up his parable, and said, 
Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! 
 
24  And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, 
and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, 
and he also shall perish for ever.
