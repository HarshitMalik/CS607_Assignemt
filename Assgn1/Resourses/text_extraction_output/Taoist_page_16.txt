HEAVEN AND EARTH
The  Great  Way  is  formless;  the  universe  is  the  Way  with
form.  The  universe  itself  does  not  speak;  sages  are  a
universe that can speak. I did not get to see the sages, but I
have  read  their  classic  writings.  By  reading  their  classic

different from seeing the sages?
God creates our bodies, God bestows our nature. Inside
and  outside  are  both  from  God;  how  dare  we  derange
them? We are within God, God is in our hearts; if we see
the  universe  and  emulate  its  purity,  this  is  not  different
from the Great Way. If we have even a little selfish intent,
we experience penalties that are not trivial.
The  physical  body  is  God-given  nature;  if  you  act  in
accord with God-given nature, you will spontaneously be
free  of  the  burden  of  human  desires.  Daily  tasks  are
norms; act in obedience to the laws of God and there will
be no mistaken excesses.
The  path  of  humanity  is  always  coordinated  with
heaven  and  earth  in  the  alternation  of  movement  and
stillness.  Human  energy  is  always  in  communion  with
heaven  and  earth  in  the  alternation  of  exhalation  and
inhalation.
I have read that the sun going down into the earth is a
symbol of the fire of the heart descending, and the moon
reaching the center of the sky is a symbol of the water of
the kidneys rising. Gazing upward, we see the North Star
abiding in its place, with the other stars revolving around
