  1607    Isaiah 65 
God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and 
 
because they are hid from mine eyes. 
New Heavens and a New Earth 
17  ¶ For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the 
 
former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
18  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, 
 
behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
19  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice 
 
of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.  
20  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man 
that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years 
 
old; but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed. 
 
21  And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant 
 
vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
22  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and 
 
another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and 
 
mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 
23  They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they 
 
are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with 
them. 
24  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and 
 
while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
25  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat 
straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They 
 
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the 
Lord.
