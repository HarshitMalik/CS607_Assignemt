  1997    Zechariah 12 
10  And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might 
break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 
11  And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that 
 
waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. 
12  And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if 
 
not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. 
13  And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price 
 
that I was prized at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, 
and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.  
14  Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break 
the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
15  Â¶ And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments 
of a foolish shepherd. 
16  For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit 
those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that 
that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the 
 
flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 
17  Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be 
 
upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried 
 
up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

The Future Deliverance of Jerusalem 
1  The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, 
which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of 
the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 
2  Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the 
people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against 
Judah and against Jerusalem. 
3  And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all 
people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, 
 
though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
