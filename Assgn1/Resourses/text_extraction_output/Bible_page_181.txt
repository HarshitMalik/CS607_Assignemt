4  and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, 
5  and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood, 
6  oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, 
7  onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the 
breastplate. 
8  And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. 
 
9  According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, 
and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye 
make it. 
The Ark of the Testimony 
10  ¶ And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half 
 
shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth 
thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 
11  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt 
thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round 
about. 
12  And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four 
corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two 
 
rings in the other side of it. 
13  And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with 
gold. 
14  And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, 
that the ark may be borne with them. 
15  The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken 
 
from it. 
16  And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give 
thee. 
17  And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half 
 
shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth 
thereof. 
18  And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shalt 
thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.
