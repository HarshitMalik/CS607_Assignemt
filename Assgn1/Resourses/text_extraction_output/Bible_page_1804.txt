  1805    Ezekiel 23 
33  Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of 
astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
34  Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the 
sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken 
 
it, saith the Lord God. 
35  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast forgotten 
 
me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy 
lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
36  ¶ The Lord said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge 
 
Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 
   
37  that they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and 
with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused 
their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the 
fire, to devour them. 
38  Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my 
 
sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 
39  For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they 
came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus 
 
have they done in the midst of mine house. 
40  And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto 
whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou 
   
didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with 
ornaments, 
41  and satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, 
whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 
42  And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the 
 
men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the 
wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful 
crowns upon their heads. 
43  ¶ Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now 
commit whoredoms with her, and she with them? 
 
44  Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth 
the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the 
 
lewd women.
