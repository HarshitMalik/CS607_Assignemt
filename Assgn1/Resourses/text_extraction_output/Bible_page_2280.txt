  2281    John 12 
24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the 
ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth 
 
much fruit. 
25  He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this 
 
world shall keep it unto life eternal.  
26  If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there 
 
shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father 
 
honor. 
The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up 
27  ¶ Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me 
   
from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 
 
28  Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, 
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
29  The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said that it 
thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 
 
30  Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for 
your sakes. 
31  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this 
 
world be cast out. 
32  And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. 
33  This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
34  The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ 
abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be 
 
lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
   
35  Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. 
Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he 
 
that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
36  While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the 
children of light. 
¶ These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself 
from them.
