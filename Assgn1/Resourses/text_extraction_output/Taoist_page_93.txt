of  individuality,  and  enjoyment  of  education.  Happiness
that  depends  on  heaven  or  on  other  people  we  cannot
necessarily insist  upon;  but  why  not  personally  fulfill  the
happiness that is up to us ourselves?
Is there anyone today who is not compelled by anyone
else?  Is  there  anyone  who  is  not  compelled  by  things?  Is
there anyone who is not compelled by the physical body?
People  have  to  get  rid  of  these  three  compulsions  before
one can talk to them about happiness.
I  have  seen  tired  people  who  have  exhausted  their
physical strength; they feel bliss as soon as they get to let
go.  If  students  of  the  Way  can  let  go,  their  pleasure  is
millions of times greater than that of worldly people.
Last  year  I  went  on  a  trip  in  the  hottest  part  of  the
summer.  I  saw  old  folks  sitting  under  shade  trees  and
thought that would be ultimate bliss. Now when I sit under
shade  trees  in  my  free  time,  I  do  not  see  what  is  so
pleasurable.  Why?  Last  year  I  was  looking  upon  leisure
when I was tired, thatâ€™s all. The idea is that this seems to
be how the poor look upon the rich, how the lower classes
look upon the upper classes.
As adults, we should simply act normally according to
our  situation;  thereby  we  can  be  self-possessed  wherever
we  are.  Wishful  thinking  is  all  useless;  all  attachments,
karmic debts, judgment, and misdeeds come from it. When
wishful thinking arises, can we not be careful?
