mind. With discernment comes clarity; with clarity comes
truthfulness. With truthfulness, the principles of the world
are apprehended and centered poise is attained.
To  know  that  the  one  good  is  balance  and  yet  not  to
reach  balance,  to  know  all  phenomena  are  mind  and  yet
not  to  understand  mind—this  is  confusion.  To  know  the
matter of birth and death is serious and yet not to realize
birthlessness,  to  know  impermanence  is  swift  yet  not  to
realize there is fundamentally no speed—this is confusion.
Principle is originally there; just call it to mind and it is
there of itself. Desire is originally not there; if you can just
see through it, it disappears of itself. Stopping desire and
keeping  to  principle  are  basically  not  two  things;  to  the
extent  that  you  have  stopped  desire,  to  that  extent  you
keep  to  principle.  Nothing  benefits  people  more  than
principle, yet those who keep to principle are few. Nothing
harms  people  more  than  desire,  yet  those  who  indulge
desires are many.
When people have desires, it is like trees having insects;
consumed  within  unknown,  before  long  they  collapse.
Those who think desire is fun do not realize desire is like
fire; if you do not put it out, you will burn yourself. Your
spirit will suffer from irritation, alcohol and sex will wear
out your vital energy, producing illness and ulcers, so you
cry  out  in  pain  day  and  night.  Buddhists  who  say  you
suffer from your sins after death do not realize you already
suffer while still alive.
