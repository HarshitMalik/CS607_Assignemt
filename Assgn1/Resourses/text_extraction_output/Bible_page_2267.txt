  2268    John 8 
Your Father the Devil 
39  ¶ They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus 
saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the 
works of Abraham. 
40  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, 
which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 
 
41  Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not 
born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. 
 
42  Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: 
 
for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, 
 
but he sent me. 
43  Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear 
 
my word. 
44  Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will 
do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the 
 
truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he 
speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 
 
45  And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. 
46  Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do 
 
ye not believe me? 
 
47  He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, 
 
because ye are not of God. 
Before Abraham Was, I Am 
48  ¶ Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that 
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
 
49  Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and ye do 
 
dishonor me. 
50  And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and 
 
judgeth. 
51  Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall 
never see death.
