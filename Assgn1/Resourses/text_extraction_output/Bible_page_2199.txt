  2200    Luke 12 
40  Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour 
 
when ye think not.  
The Unfaithful Servant 
41  ¶ Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto 
us, or even to all? 
 
42  And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, 
whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them 
their portion of meat in due season? 
 
43  Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so 
doing. 
44  Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that 
he hath. 
45  But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his 
coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and 
 
to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 
 
46  the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for 
him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in 
sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. 
47  And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not 
himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many 
stripes. 
48  But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, 
shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is 
given, of him shall be much required; and to whom men have 
 
committed much, of him they will ask the more. 
Jesus the Cause of Division 
49  ¶ I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be 
 
already kindled? 
 
50  But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened 
 
till it be accomplished!
