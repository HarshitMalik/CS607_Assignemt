Therefore  when  ancient  sages  educated  people,  first  they
elucidated  the  principles  of  the  five  norms;  and  yet  there
are people of the present generation who seek the way by
mortifying  their  physical  bodies  and  departing  from
human  norms.  They  are  certainly  unaware  that  they  are
wrong; and when people of the world revere and worship
them  out  of  amazement,  they  too  don’t  know  they’re
wrong.
OLD AGE
People all say that after sixty you age year by year; after
seventy,  you  age  month  by  month;  after  eighty,  you  age
day by day. I am more than eighty years old—now what?
From now on, each day I live is a day lent by Heaven for
the  Way—how  dare  I  waste  it?  Even  if  I  attain  the  Way
right now, it is already late—how could it be admissible to
delay any further?
A  long  time  ago  three  elders  were  talking  about
impermanence. One elder said, “Of those who attend this
year’s  party,  who  knows  who  will  be  missing  next  year.”
Another  elder  said,  “What  you’re  talking  about  is  far
away. When we take off our shoes and socks tonight, we
don’t  know  whether  or  not  we  will  put  them  on  again
tomorrow.”  The  third  elder  said,  “What  you’re  talking
about is still remote. When we exhale this breath, we don’t
know if we will breathe in again.”
