  1935    Amos 5 
and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained 
 
upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. 
8  So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but 
 
they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
 
Lord. 
9  I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens 
 
and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees 
increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not 
 
returned unto me, saith the Lord. 
10  I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: 
 
your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away 
your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up 
 
unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
 
Lord. 
11  I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and 
Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: 
 
yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 
12  Â¶ Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do 
 
this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 
13  For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and 
declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning 
darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The 
Lord, The God of hosts, is his name.

A Call to Repentance 
1  Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, 
O house of Israel. 
2  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken 
   
upon her land; there is none to raise her up. 
 
3  For thus saith the Lord God; The city that went out by a thousand 
 
shall leave a hundred, and that which went forth by a hundred shall 
leave ten, to the house of Israel.
