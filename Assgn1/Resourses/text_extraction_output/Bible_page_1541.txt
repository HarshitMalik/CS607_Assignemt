no understanding? 
 
The Redemption of Israel 
17  ¶ Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a 
fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? 
 
18  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the 
eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. 
19  The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor 
among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
20  For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is 
consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 
 
21  that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him 
that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of 
nought. 
22  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, 
concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, 
neither shall his face now wax pale. 
23  But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the 
midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy 
One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. 
24  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they 
that murmured shall learn doctrine.

The Futility of Reliance on Egypt 
1  Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, 
but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, 
 
that they may add sin to sin: 
 
2  that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; 
 
to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in 
the shadow of Egypt!
