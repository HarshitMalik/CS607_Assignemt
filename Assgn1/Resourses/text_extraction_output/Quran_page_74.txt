heareth and knoweth (all things). -201- Those who fear Allah, when a thought of evil from Satan

revealed to me from my Lord: this is (nothing but) lights from your Lord, and guidance, and 
mercy, for any who have Faith. -204- When the Quran is read, listen to it with attention, and hold 
your peace: that ye may receive mercy. -205- And do thou (O reader) bring thy Lord to 
remembrance in thy (very) soul, with humility and in reverence, without loudness in words, in the 
mornings and evenings; and be not thou of those who are unheedful. -206- Those who are near
