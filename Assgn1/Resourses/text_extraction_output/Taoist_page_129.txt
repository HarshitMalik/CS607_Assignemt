Lie on your side, breathing softly through the nose, the
soul not stirring within, the spirit not roaming outside.
Do  this,  and  your  energy  and  vitality  will  naturally
stabilize.
PURITY AND SERENITY
If people can master the path of purity and serenity, that is
most  excellent.  Therefore  scripture  says,  “If  people  can
always be pure and serene, heaven and earth will resort to
them.”
This “heaven and earth” does not mean the external sky
and ground. It refers to the heaven and earth in the body.
Above the solar plexus is called heaven, below the solar
plexus  is  called  earth.  If  the  energy  of  heaven  descends
and  the  vessel  of  earth  opens,  so  that  there  is  harmony
above  and  below,  then  vitality  and  energy  spontaneously
stabilize.
ATTAINING THE WAY
The  substance  of  the  Way  is  no  mind,  the  application  is
forgetting words.
The  basis  is  softness,  the  foundation  is  purity  and
serenity.
If it is to be carried out among people, it is necessary to
be  moderate  in  eating  and  drinking,  to  stop  musing  and
mulling, to sit quietly to tune your breathing, and to sleep
peacefully to nurture energy.
