occur  to  them  realize  that  thoughts  have  no  essence  of
their  own—being  conditionally  originated,  they  are
therefore empty.
LIKES
Every  human  mind  has  likes.  Likes  are  where  the  mind
tends to focus.
There are things we do not expect to be so, yet are so;
after all we do not know why they are so.
Insofar as the level of human character can be judged by
a single thought, and a whole lifetime’s success or failure
can be determined by one time, we cannot but be careful.
If people’s likes are humanity and justice, courtesy and
music, poetry and classics, we know without question that
they  are  intelligent.  If  their  likes  are  idleness,  gambling,
drinking,  and  whoring,  then  we  know  without  question
they are wastrels.
If  their  likes  are  gardening,  fishing,  and  woodcutting,
we know without question they are peasants. If their likes
are quarreling, boasting, and weaponry, we know without
question they are violent people.
Generally speaking, there are five losses that go with a
liking  for  amusement  and  play.  They  are  pollution  of  the
body, wearying of the spirit, waste of wealth, loss of time,
and  making  mistakes  at  work.  Even  if  you  are  extremely
skilled,  you  cannot  go  far;  that  is  why  cultured  people
abstain.
