  768    1 Kings 3 
hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a 
son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 
7  And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king 
instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not 
   
how to go out or come in. 
8  And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast 
chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for 
multitude. 
9  Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy 
people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to 
 
judge this thy so great a people? 
 
10  ¶ And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this 
thing. 
11  And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and 
hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for 
 
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for 
 
thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
 
12  behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a 
 
wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee 
 
before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
13  And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both 
riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings 
 
like unto thee all thy days. 
14  And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my 
commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen 
thy days. 
15  ¶ And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came 
 
to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, 
and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and 
made a feast to all his servants.
