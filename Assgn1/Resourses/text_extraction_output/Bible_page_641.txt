  642    1 Samuel 11 
6  And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, 
and his anger was kindled greatly. 
7  And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent 
them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, 
saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so 
shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the 
people, and they came out with one consent. 
8  And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were 
three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
9  And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say 
unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by that time the sun be 
hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to 
the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 
 
10  Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto 
you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. 
11  And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three 
companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the 
 
morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: 
 
and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so 
that two of them were not left together. 
12  Â¶ And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul 
reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. 
 
13  And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for 
 
today the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel. 
14  Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and 
renew the kindgom there. 
15  And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king 
before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of 
 
peace offerings before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of 
 
Israel rejoiced greatly.
