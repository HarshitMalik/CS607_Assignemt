BHAGAVAD GITA
Sarvabhootaani kaunteya prakritim yaanti maamikaam;
Kalpakshaye punastaani kalpaadau visrijaamyaham.
7. All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again
at the beginning of (the next) Kalpa!
Prakritim swaamavashtabhya visrijaami punah punah;
Bhootagraamamimam kritsnamavasham prakritervashaat.
8. Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless
by the force of Nature.
Na cha maam taani karmaani nibadhnanti dhananjaya;
Udaaseenavadaaseenam asaktam teshu karmasu.
9. These actions do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those
acts!
Mayaa’dhyakshena prakritih sooyate sacharaacharam;
Hetunaa’nena kaunteya jagadwiparivartate.
10. Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of
this, O Arjuna, the world revolves!
Avajaananti maam moodhaah maanusheem tanumaashritam;
Param bhaavamajaananto mama bhootamaheshwaram.
11. Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great
Lord of (all) beings.
COMMENTARY: Fools who do not have discrimination despise Me, dwelling in human
form. I have taken this body in order to bless My devotees. These fools have no knowledge of My
higher Being. I am the great Lord, the Supreme.
Moghaashaa moghakarmaano moghajnaanaa vichetasah;
Raakshaseemaasureem chaiva prakritim mohineem shritaah.
12. Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are
possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings.
Mahaatmaanastu maam paartha daiveem prakritimaashritaah;
Bhajantyananyamanaso jnaatwaa bhootaadimavyayam.
13. But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single
mind (with the mind devoted to nothing else), knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings!
