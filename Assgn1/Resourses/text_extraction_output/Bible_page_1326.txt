  1327    Psalms 93 
and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against 
me. 
12  The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: 
 
he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
13  Those that be planted in the house of the Lord 
shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
14  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; 
 
they shall be fat and flourishing; 
 
15  to show that the Lord is upright: 
 
he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

The Majesty of the Lord 
1  The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; 
 
the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded 
himself: 
 
the world also is stablished, 
that it cannot be moved. 
2  Thy throne is established of old: 
 
thou art from everlasting. 
3  The floods have lifted up, O Lord, 
the floods have lifted up their voice; 
 
the floods lift up their waves. 
4  The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, 
yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 
5  Thy testimonies are very sure: 
 
holiness becometh thine house, 
O Lord, for ever.
