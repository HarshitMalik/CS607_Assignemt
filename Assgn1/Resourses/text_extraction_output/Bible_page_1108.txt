  1109    Nehemiah 13 
commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the 
porters; and the offerings of the priests. 
 
6  But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and 
 
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, 
and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: 
 
7  and I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib 
did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the 
house of God. 
8  And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff 
 
of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
9  Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither 
 
brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat 
offering and the frankincense. 
10  ¶ And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been 
given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were 
 
fled every one to his field. 
11  Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of 
God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their 
 
place. 
12  Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and 
the oil unto the treasuries.  
13  And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, 
and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them 
 
was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were 
 
counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their 
brethren. 
14  Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my 
good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the 
offices thereof. 
15  ¶ In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the 
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, 
 
grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into 
Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day 
 
wherein they sold victuals.
