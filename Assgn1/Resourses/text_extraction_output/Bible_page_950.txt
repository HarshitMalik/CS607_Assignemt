  951    1 Chronicles 21 
6  And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great 
stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each 
hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant. 
 
7  But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s 
brother slew him. 
8  These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand 
 
of David, and by the hand of his servants.

David Numbers Israel and Judah 
1  And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number 
Israel. 
2  And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number 
Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them 
 
to me, that I may know it. 
3  And Joab answered, The Lord make his people a hundred times so 
many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my 
 
lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will 
   
he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 
 
4  Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore 
Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to 
Jerusalem. 
5  And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. 
And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred 
thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred 
 
threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
6  But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s 
 
word was abominable to Joab. 
7  ¶ And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote 
 
Israel. 
8  And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have 
done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of 
 
thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
