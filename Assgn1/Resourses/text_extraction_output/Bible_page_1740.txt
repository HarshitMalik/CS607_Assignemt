  1741    Lamentations 1 
they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: 
 
he hath made my strength to fall, 
the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, 
from whom I am not able to rise up. 
15  The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst 
of me: 
 
he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: 
 
the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a 
winepress. 
16  For these things I weep; 
 
mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, 
because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: 
 
my children are desolate, 
because the enemy prevailed. 
17  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, 
and there is none to comfort her: 
 
the Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob, 
that his adversaries should be round about him: 
 
Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. 
18  The Lord is righteous; 
 
for I have rebelled against his commandment: 
 
hear, I pray you, all people, 
and behold my sorrow: 
 
my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. 
19  I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: 
 
my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, 
while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. 
20  Behold, O Lord; for I am in distress: 
   
my bowels are troubled; 
 
mine heart is turned within me; 
 
for I have grievously rebelled: 
 
abroad the sword bereaveth, 
at home there is as death. 
21  They have heard that I sigh; 
 
there is none to comfort me:
