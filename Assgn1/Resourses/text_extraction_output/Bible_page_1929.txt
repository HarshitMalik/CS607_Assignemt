[Amos] 
1 
The Judgments on Israel’s Neighbors 
1  The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which 
he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in 
the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years 
before the earthquake. 
2  ¶ And he said, The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice 
from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn,

4  but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour 
the palaces of Ben-hadad. 
5  I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant 
from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the 
house of Eden [or, from Beth-eden]: and the people of Syria shall go 
 
into captivity unto Kir, saith the Lord. 
6  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for 
 
four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they 
 
carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to 
Edom: 
 
7  but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the 
palaces thereof: 
 
8  and I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that 
holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand 
against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith 
 
the Lord God. 
9  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for 
 
four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they
