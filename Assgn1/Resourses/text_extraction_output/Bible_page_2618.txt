  2619    Revelation 3 
20  Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou 
sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to 
teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat 
things sacrificed unto idols. 
21  And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented 
 
not. 
22  Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery 
with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 
23  And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall 
 
know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will 
 
give unto every one of you according to your works.  
24  But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have 
not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, 
as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. 
 
25  But that which ye have already, hold fast till I come. 
26  And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to 
him will I give power over the nations: 
 
27  and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter 
 
shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 
 
28  And I will give him the morning star. 
29  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches.

The Message to Sardis 
1  And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith 
 
he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars. 
Â¶ I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art 
dead. 
2  Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are 
ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. 
 
3  Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold 
fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
