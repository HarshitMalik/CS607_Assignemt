  1364    Psalms 119 
and grant me thy law graciously. 
30  I have chosen the way of truth: 
 
thy judgments have I laid before me. 
31  I have stuck unto thy testimonies: 
 
O Lord, put me not to shame. 
32  I will run the way of thy commandments, 
when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 
he 
33  Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; 
 
and I shall keep it unto the end. 
34  Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; 
 
yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. 
35  Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; 
 
for therein do I delight. 
36  Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, 
and not to covetousness. 
37  Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; 
 
and quicken thou me in thy way. 
38  Stablish thy word unto thy servant, 
who is devoted to thy fear. 
39  Turn away my reproach which I fear: 
 
for thy judgments are good. 
40  Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: 
 
quicken me in thy righteousness. 
vau 
41  Let thy mercies come also unto me, O Lord, 
even thy salvation, according to thy word. 
42  So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: 
 
for I trust in thy word. 
43  And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; 
 
for I have hoped in thy judgments. 
44  So shall I keep thy law continually 
for ever and ever. 
45  And I will walk at liberty: 
 
for I seek thy precepts.
