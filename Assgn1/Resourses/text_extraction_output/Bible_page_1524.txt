  1525    Isaiah 20 
19  ¶ In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the 
land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. 
20  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts 
in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of 
 
the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, 
and he shall deliver them. 
21  And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall 
know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, 
 
they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. 
22  And the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and 
   
they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of 
them, and shall heal them. 
23  ¶ In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and 
the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, 
and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. 
24  ¶ In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, 
even a blessing in the midst of the land: 
 
25  whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my 
people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine 
inheritance.

Assyria to Conquer Egypt and Ethiopia 
1  In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king 
of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it; 
 
2  at the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, 
Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe 
from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
3  And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked 
and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and 
upon Ethiopia;
