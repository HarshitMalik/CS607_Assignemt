  2246    John 2 
5  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, 
do it. 
6  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of 
the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
7  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they 
filled them up to the brim. 
8  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the 
governor of the feast. And they bare it. 
9  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made 
wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants which drew 
the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 
10  and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth 
good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is 
 
worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. 
 
11  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and 
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
 
12  ¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and 
his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many 
 
days. 
The Cleansing of the Temple 
13  ¶ And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to 
Jerusalem, 
14  and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, 
and the changers of money sitting: 
 
15  and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all 
out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the 
 
changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; 
 
16  and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make 
 
not my Father’s house a house of merchandise. 
17  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine 
house hath eaten me up.  
18  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest 
thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
