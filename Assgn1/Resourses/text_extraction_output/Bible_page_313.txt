numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after 
the house of their fathers, 
35  from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every 
one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of 
the congregation: 
 
36  and those that were numbered of them by their families were two 
thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
37  These were they that were numbered of the families of the

congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the 
commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
38  ¶ And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, 
throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of 
the congregation, 
40  even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, 
by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred 
and thirty. 
41  These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of 
Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the 
congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to 
the commandment of the Lord. 
42  ¶ And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of

the congregation, 
44  even those that were numbered of them after their families, were 
three thousand and two hundred.

of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
