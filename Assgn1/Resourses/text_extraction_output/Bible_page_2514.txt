  2515    Colossians 4 
15  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the 
church which is in his house. 
16  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also 
in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle 
 
from Laodicea. 
17  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast 
received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. 
18  Â¶ The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. 
Grace be with you. Amen.
