  128    Exodus 3 
16  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and 
 
drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
17  And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up 
 
and helped them, and watered their flock. 
18  And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye 
are come so soon today? 
 
19  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the 
shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the 
flock. 
20  And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye 
 
have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
 
21  And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses 
 
Zipporah his daughter. 
22  And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom [a stranger 
there]: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
 
23  ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt 
died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, 
 
and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the 
bondage. 
24  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant 
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
25  And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect 
unto them.

The Call of Moses 
1  Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of 
Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and 
 
came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 
2  And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out 
of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned 
 
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
