  1988    Zechariah 6 
6  And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth 
 
forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the 
earth. 
7  And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a 
 
woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 
8  And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the 
ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
 
9  Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out 
two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings 
 
like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the 
 
earth and the heaven. 
10  Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear 
the ephah? 
 
11  And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar: and 
 
it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

The Four Chariots 
1  And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, 
there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the 
 
mountains were mountains of brass. 
2  In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black 
 
horses;  
 
3  and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot 
 
grizzled and bay horses. 
4  Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
are these, my lord? 
 
5  And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits 
of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all 
the earth. 
6  The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; 
 
and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth toward 
 
the south country.
