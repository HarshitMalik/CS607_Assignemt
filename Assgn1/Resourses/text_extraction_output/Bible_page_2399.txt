  2400    Romans 6 
14  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them 
that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, 
who is the figure of him that was to come. 
15  ¶ But not as the offense, so also is the free gift: for if through the 
 
offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the 
gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto 
many. 
16  And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment 
 
was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses 
unto justification. 
17  For if by one man’s offense death reigned by one; much more they 
 
which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness 
shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 
18  ¶ Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to 
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came 
 
upon all men unto justification of life. 
19  For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by 
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 
20  Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But 
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 
 
21  that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign 
through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

Dead to Sin but Alive in Christ 
1  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may 
 
abound? 
 
2  God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer 
therein? 
 
3  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ 
were baptized into his death?
