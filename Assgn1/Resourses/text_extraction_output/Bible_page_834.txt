  835    2 Kings 2 
10  And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see 
 
me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it 
 
shall not be so. 
11  And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, 
there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them 
both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
 
12  And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of 
Israel, and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more. 
 
¶ And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 
13  He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went 
back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 
 
14  and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the 
waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? And when he 
 
also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and 
 
Elisha went over. 
15  ¶ And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho 
saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And 
they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground 
before him. 
16  And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants 
fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: 
   
lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and 
cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye 
shall not send. 
17  And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They 
sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him 
 
not. 
18  And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he 
said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? 
 
19  ¶ And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the 
situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is 
 
naught, and the ground barren. 
20  And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they 
brought it to him.
