  1098    Nehemiah 9 
ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great 
kindness, and forsookest them not. 
18  Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy 
God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great 
provocations; 
 
19  yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the 
wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, 
 
to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show 
 
them light, and the way wherein they should go. 
20  Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest 
not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their 
thirst. 
21  Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that 
they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet 
 
swelled not.  
22  Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide 
them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the 
 
land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.  
23  Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and 
broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst 
promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.  
24  So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst 
before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest 
them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, 
that they might do with them as they would.  
25  And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses 
full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit 
trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, 
 
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.  
26  Â¶ Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, 
and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which 
testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great 
provocations. 
27  Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, 
who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried
