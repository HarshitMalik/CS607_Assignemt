  127    Exodus 2 
5  And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the 
river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side: and when 
   
she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
6  And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the 
 
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of 
the Hebrews’ children. 
7  Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee 
a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for 
thee? 
 
8  And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and 
called the child’s mother. 
9  And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and 
nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took 
the child, and nursed it. 
10  And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, 
and he became her son. And she called his name Moses [drawn 
out]: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
 
Moses Flees from Egypt 
11  ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he 
went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he 
 
spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
12  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there 
was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
13  And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the 
Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, 
 
Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
 
14  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? 
 
intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses 
 
feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
15  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. 
¶ But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of 
Midian: and he sat down by a well.
