  114    Genesis 47 
25  These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his 
daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. 
 
26  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of 
his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore 
and six; 
 
27  and the sons of Joseph, which were borne him in Egypt, were two 
souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, 
 
were threescore and ten.  
28  ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto 
Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
 
29  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his 
father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on 
 
his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
30  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy 
face, because thou art yet alive. 
31  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I 
will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and 
my father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto 
me; 
 
32  and the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; 
 
and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that 
they have. 
33  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall 
say, What is your occupation? 
 
34  That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from 
our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye 
 
may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an 
 
abomination unto the Egyptians. 
47 
1  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my 
brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, 
are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the 
 
land of Goshen.
