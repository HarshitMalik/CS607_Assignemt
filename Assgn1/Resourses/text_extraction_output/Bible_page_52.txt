  53    Genesis 24 
25  She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender 
enough, and room to lodge in. 
26  And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord. 
27  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who 
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being 
 
in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master’s brethren. 
28  ¶ And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these 
things. 
29  And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban 
 
ran out unto the man, unto the well. 
30  And it came to pass, when he saw the earring, and bracelets upon 
his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his 
sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me, that he came unto the 
man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 
 
31  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore 
 
standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for 
 
the camels. 
32  And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and 
 
gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his 
feet, and the men’s feet that were with him. 
33  And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, 
 
until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 
34  ¶ And he said, I am Abraham’s servant. 
35  And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become 
great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, 
 
and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. 
36  And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was 
old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
 
37  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife 
to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I 
dwell: 
 
38  but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and 
take a wife unto my son. 
39  And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not 
follow me.
