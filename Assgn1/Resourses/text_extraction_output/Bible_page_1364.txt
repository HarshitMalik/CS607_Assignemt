  1365    Psalms 119 
46  I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, 
and will not be ashamed. 
47  And I will delight myself in thy commandments, 
which I have loved. 
48  My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, 
which I have loved; 
 
and I will meditate in thy statutes. 
zain 
49  Remember the word unto thy servant, 
upon which thou hast caused me to hope. 
50  This is my comfort in my affliction: 
 
for thy word hath quickened me. 
51  The proud have had me greatly in derision: 
 
yet have I not declined from thy law. 
52  I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord; 
 
and have comforted myself. 
53  Horror hath taken hold upon me 
because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
54  Thy statutes have been my songs 
in the house of my pilgrimage. 
55  I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night, 
and have kept thy law. 
56  This I had, 
because I kept thy precepts. 
cheth 
57  Thou art my portion, O Lord: 
 
I have said that I would keep thy words. 
58  I entreated thy favor with my whole heart: 
 
be merciful unto me according to thy word. 
59  I thought on my ways, 
and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 
60  I made haste, and delayed not 
to keep thy commandments. 
61  The bands of the wicked have robbed me: 
 
but I have not forgotten thy law.
