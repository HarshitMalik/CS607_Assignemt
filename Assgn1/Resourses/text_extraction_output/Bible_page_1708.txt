  1709    Jeremiah 42 
14  saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall 
 
see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of 
bread; and there will we dwell: 
   
15  and now therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of 
Judah; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly 
   
set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 
 
16  then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall 
overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof 
 
ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there 
 
ye shall die. 
17  So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to 
sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by 
 
the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the 
 
evil that I will bring upon them. 
18  Â¶ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger 
 
and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye 
 
shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an 
 
astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this 
 
place no more. 
19  The Lord hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye 
 
not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this 
 
day. 
20  For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the Lord 
your God, saying, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and 
 
according unto all that the Lord our God shall say, so declare unto 
us, and we will do it. 
21  And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed 
 
the voice of the Lord your God, nor any thing for the which he 
hath sent me unto you. 
22  Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the 
famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go 
and to sojourn.
