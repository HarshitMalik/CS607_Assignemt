and have undivided faith in it, you cannot truly appreciate
it.
Even if you know how to recite the texts, you still have
to discern reality from artificiality. Why? Sound and form
dim  the  mind,  falsehoods  fool  the  ears;  personality  and
ego become second nature, the disease of self-affirmation
is deepseated. When the mind is separated from the Way,
the principle is hard to comprehend.
If  you  wish  to  return  to  the  supreme  Way,  have  deep
faith  and  first  accept  three  precepts.  If  you  practice  in
accord  with  these  three  precepts  consistently  from
beginning to end, then you will attain the true Way.
The three precepts are:
1.  simplifying involvements
2.  not craving anything
3.  quieting the mind
If  you  diligently  practice  these  three  precepts  without
flagging, then even if you have no mind to seek the Way
the Way will come of itself.
A scripture says, “If people can empty their minds and
not contrive anything, it is not that they want the Way, but
the Way spontaneously reverts to them.”
Speaking  on  this  basis,  this  quintessential  method  is
genuinely trustworthy and truly valuable.
Nevertheless,  the  ordinary  mind  is  excitable  and
obstinate and has long been that way, so to bring the mind
to rest by means of precepts is in fact very hard.
