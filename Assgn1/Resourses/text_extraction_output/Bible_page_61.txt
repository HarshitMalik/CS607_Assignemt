  62    Genesis 27 
7  Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and 
bless thee before the Lord before my death. 
8  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I 
command thee. 
9  Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the 
goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he 
 
loveth: 
 
10  and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he 
may bless thee before his death. 
11  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a 
hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 
 
12  my father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a 
deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
 
13  And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only 
 
obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
14  And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his 
 
mother made savory meat, such as his father loved. 
15  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which 
were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger 
son: 
 
16  and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and 
upon the smooth of his neck: 
 
17  and she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had 
prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
18  Â¶ And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, 
 
Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
   
19  And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done 
 
according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my 
 
venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
20  And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so 
quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it 
 
to me. 
21  And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel 
thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
