  1591    Isaiah 56 
5  Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations 
that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of the Lord thy 
God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee. 
 
6  ¶ Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while 
he is near: 
 
7  let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his 
thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have 
 
mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 
 
8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my 
ways, saith the Lord. 
9  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher 
than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
10  ¶ For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and 
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring 
forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the 
eater:  
 
11  so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not 
 
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, 
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. 
12  ¶ For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the 
 
mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, 
and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 
13  Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the 
brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for 
 
a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

The Rewards of Keeping God’s Covenant 
1  Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my 
 
salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. 
2  Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth 
hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth 
 
his hand from doing any evil.
