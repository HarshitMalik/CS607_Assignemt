It is ridiculous to be in the mundane world not knowing
that dreams are dreams.
GHOSTS
Half  the  people  in  the  world  are  deluded  by  ghosts,  and
half  are  confused  by  other  people.  Getting  each  other  all
excited, they practically fill the world.
Those of lofty illumination try to save them by speaking
clearly,  but  they  do  not  heed.  Those  in  positions  of
authority try to restrain them by law, but they do not stop.
False doctrines increase in popularity day by dayâ€”in the
future, who knows where it will end!
Ghosts  are  people  who  have  already  died;  people  are
ghosts who have not yet died; and the spirits of today are
all  people  of  ancient  times.  There  are  ghosts  and  spirits
everywhere in the world; and not only are there ghosts and
spirits in the world, there are also ghosts and spirits within
the body.
How  do  we  know  this?  Human  nature  comes  from
positive  energy,  while  the  physical  body  comes  from
negative  energy.  Positive  energy  is  the  spirit,  negative
energy is the ghost. Returning feeling to nature is the way
of  the  spirit,  following  feeling  and  losing  nature  is  the
business of the ghost.
A proverb says that as long as people have any positive
energy  they  do  not  become  ghosts,  while  as  long  as  they
have any negative energy they do not become immortals.
