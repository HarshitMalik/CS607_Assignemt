  2087    Matthew 26 
41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit 
 
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
42  He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my 
Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy 
will be done. 
43  And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were 
 
heavy. 
44  And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, 
saying the same words. 
45  Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on 
now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of 
 
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
46  Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 
 
The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus 
47  Â¶ And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and 
with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief 
priests and elders of the people. 
48  Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I 
shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast. 
 
49  And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master; and kissed 
 
him. 
50  And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then 
 
came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 
51  And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his 
hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, 
and smote off his ear. 
52  Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for 
 
all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
53  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall 
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 
 
54  But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
