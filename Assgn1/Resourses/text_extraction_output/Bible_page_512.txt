  513    Joshua 9 
35  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua 
read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and 
the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

The Deceit of the Gibeonites 
1  And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side 
Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the 
great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the 
Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof; 
 
2  that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and 
with Israel, with one accord. 
3  Â¶ And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done 
unto Jericho and to Ai, 
4  they did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been 
ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, 
old, and rent, and bound up; 
 
5  and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon 
them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy. 
 
6  And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto 
him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now 
 
therefore make ye a league with us. 
7  And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell 
among us; and how shall we make a league with you?  
   
8  And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said 
unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? 
   
9  And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are 
come, because of the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard 
 
the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 
10  and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were 
beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of 
Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
