BHAGAVAD GITA
44. Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable
Lord! As a father forgives his son, a friend his (dear) friend, a lover his beloved, even so shouldst
Thou forgive me, O God!
Adrishtapoorvam hrishitoâ€™smi drishtwaa
Bhayena cha pravyathitam mano me;
Tadeva me darshaya deva roopam
Praseeda devesha jagannivaasa.
45. I am delighted, having seen what has never been seen before; and yet my mind is
distressed with fear. Show me that (previous) form only, O God! Have mercy, O God of gods! O
abode of the universe!
Kireetinam gadinam chakrahastam
Icchaami twaam drashtumaham tathaiva;
Tenaiva roopena chaturbhujena
Sahasrabaaho bhava vishwamoorte.
46. I desire to see Thee as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Thy
former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Form (Being)!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Mayaa prasannena tavaarjunedam
Roopam param darshitamaatmayogaat;
Tejomayam vishwamanantamaadyam
Yanme twadanyena na drishtapoorvam.
The Blessed Lord said:
47. O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic
power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen
before by anyone other than thyself.
Na vedayajnaadhyayanairna daanair
Na cha kriyaabhirna tapobhirugraih;
Evam roopah shakya aham nriloke
Drashtum twadanyena karupraveera.
48. Neither by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts, nor by rituals, nor by
severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than thyself, O great
hero of the Kurus (Arjuna)!
Maa te vyathaa maa cha vimoodhabhaavo
Drishtwaa roopam ghorameedringmamedam;
Vyapetabheeh preetamanaah punastwam
Tadeva me roopamidam prapashya.
