is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if 
ye return unto him. 
10  ¶ So the posts passed from city to city, through the country of 
Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed 
 
them to scorn, and mocked them. 
11  Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun 
humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
12  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the 
commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the 
Lord. 
13  ¶ And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast 
of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great 
congregation. 
14  And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and 
all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the 
brook Kidron. 
15  Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second 
month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and 
 
sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the 
house of the Lord. 
16  And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the 
law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which 
 
they received of the hand of the Levites. 
17  For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: 
 
therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers 
for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord. 
18  For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and 
Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet 
did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But 
Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord pardon every 
one 
19  that prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, 
though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the 
sanctuary. 
20  And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
