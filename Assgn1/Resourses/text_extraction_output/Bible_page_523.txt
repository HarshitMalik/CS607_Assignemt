9  from Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city 
that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto 
Dibon; 
 
10  and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in 
Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 
 
11  and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and 
all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 
 
12  all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and 
in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did 
 
Moses smite, and cast them out. 
13  Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor 
the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell 
 
among the Israelites until this day. 
The Inheritances Given by Moses 
14  ¶ Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the 
 
sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their 
inheritance, as he said unto them.  
15  ¶ And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben 
inheritance according to their families. 
16  And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river 
Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the 
plain by Medeba; 
 
17  Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and 
 
Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon, 
18  and Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 
19  and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of 
the valley, 
20  and Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, 
21  and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of 
the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with 
the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and 
Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
