  749    2 Samuel 22 
13  Through the brightness before him 
were coals of fire kindled. 
14  The Lord thundered from heaven, 
and the Most High uttered his voice. 
15  And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; 
 
lightning, and discomfited them. 
16  And the channels of the sea appeared, 
the foundations of the world were discovered, 
at the rebuking of the Lord, 
at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 
17  He sent from above, he took me; 
 
he drew me out of many waters: 
 
18  he delivered me from my strong enemy, 
and from them that hated me: 
 
for they were too strong for me. 
19  They prevented me in the day of my calamity: 
 
but the Lord was my stay. 
20  He brought me forth also into a large place: 
 
he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
21  The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
 
according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
22  For I have kept the ways of the Lord, 
and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
23  For all his judgments were before me: 
 
and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. 
24  I was also upright before him, 
and have kept myself from mine iniquity. 
25  Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my 
righteousness; 
 
according to my cleanness in his eyesight. 
26  With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, 
and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright. 
27  With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; 
 
and with the froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory. 
28  And the afflicted people thou wilt save:
