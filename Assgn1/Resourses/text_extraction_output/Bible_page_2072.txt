  2073    Matthew 22 
The Question about the Resurrection 
23  ¶ The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is 
no resurrection, and asked him, 
24  saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his 
brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  
25  Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had 
 
married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto 
his brother: 
 
26  likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 
27  And last of all the woman died also. 
28  Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? 
 
for they all had her. 
29  ¶ Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the 
Scriptures, nor the power of God. 
30  For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in 
marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. 
31  But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that 
which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 
32  I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of 
Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 
 
33  And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his 
doctrine. 
The Great Commandment 
34  ¶ But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees 
to silence, they were gathered together. 
35  Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, 
tempting him, and saying, 
36  Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 
 
37  Jesus said unto him, 
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  
38  This is the first and great commandment.
