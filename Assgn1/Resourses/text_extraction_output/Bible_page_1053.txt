The Proclamation of Cyrus 
1  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord 
stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a 
proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in 
writing, saying, 
2  ¶ Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath 
given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to 
 
build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 
3  Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and 
 
let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house 
of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. 
4  And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let 
the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with 
goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill offering for the house of 
God that is in Jerusalem. 
The Return of the Exiles to Jerusalem 
5  ¶ Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and 
the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had 
raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in 
Jerusalem. 
6  And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with 
vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with 
precious things, besides all that was willingly offered. 
7  Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, 
and had put them in the house of his gods;
