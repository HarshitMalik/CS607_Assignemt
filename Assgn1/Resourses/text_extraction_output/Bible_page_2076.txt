  2077    Matthew 24 
Jesus Laments over Jerusalem 
37  ¶ O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest 
them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered 
thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under 
her wings, and ye would not! 
 
38  Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. 
39  For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, 
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  
24 
The Destruction of the Temple and Signs before the End 
1  And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his 
 
disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple. 
2  And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say 
 
unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that 
shall not be thrown down. 
3  ¶ And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto 
him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
 
shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? 
 
4  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man 
deceive you. 
5  For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall 
 
deceive many. 
6  And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not 
 
troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not 
 
yet. 
7  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
 
and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in 
divers places. 
8  All these are the beginning of sorrows. 
9  ¶ Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: 
 
and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
