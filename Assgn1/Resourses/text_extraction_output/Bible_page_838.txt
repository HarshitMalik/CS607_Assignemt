The Widow’s Oil 
1  Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the 
prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and 
 
thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord: and the creditor 
 
is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 
2  And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what 
 
hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not 
 
any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
3  Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, 
even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 
 
4  And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee 
and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and 
thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
5  So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her 
sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. 
 
6  And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto 
her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a 
vessel more. And the oil stayed. 
7  Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the 
oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest. 
Elisha and the Shunammite Woman 
8  ¶ And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a 
great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, 
 
that, as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 
9  And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a 
holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 
10  Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set 
 
for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and 
 
it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
