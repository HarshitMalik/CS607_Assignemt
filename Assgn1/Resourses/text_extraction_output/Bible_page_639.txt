  640    1 Samuel 10 
11  And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, 
behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said 
one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is 
 
Saul also among the prophets? 
 
12  And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their 
father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the 
 
prophets?  
 
13  And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high 
place. 
14  ¶ And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went 
ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were 
   
no where, we came to Samuel. 
15  And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto 
you. 
16  And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were 
found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he 
told him not. 
17  ¶ And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh; 
 
18  and said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of 
Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the 
hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of 
them that oppressed you: 
 
19  and ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out 
of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto 
 
him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves 
before the Lord by your tribes, and by your thousands. 
20  ¶ And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, 
the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 
21  When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their 
families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish 
was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. 
 
22  Therefore they inquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet 
come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold, he hath hid 
himself among the stuff.
