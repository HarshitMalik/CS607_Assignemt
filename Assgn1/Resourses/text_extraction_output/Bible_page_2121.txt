fuller on earth can white them. 
4  And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were 
 
talking with Jesus. 
5  And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be

restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he 
 
must suffer many things, and be set at nought. 
13  But I say unto you, That Elijah is indeed come, and they have done 
unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

them, and the scribes questioning with them. 
15  And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were 
greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. 
16  And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 
 
17  And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have 
brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
