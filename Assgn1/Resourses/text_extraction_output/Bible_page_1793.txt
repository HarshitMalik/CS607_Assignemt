  1794    Ezekiel 20 
16  because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my 
statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their 
 
idols. 
17  Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither 
did I make an end of them in the wilderness. 
18  ¶ But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in 
the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor 
defile yourselves with their idols: 
 
19  I am the Lord your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my 
 
judgments, and do them; 
 
20  and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and 
 
you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. 
21  Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against me: they walked 
 
not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if 
a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths. 
 
¶ Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish 
my anger against them in the wilderness. 
22  Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s 
sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in 
whose sight I brought them forth. 
23  I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I 
would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through 
the countries;  
 
24  because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my 
statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after 
their fathers’ idols. 
25  Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and 
judgments whereby they should not live; 
 
26  and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass 
through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them 
desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord. 
27  ¶ Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say 
unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Yet in this your fathers have 
 
blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
