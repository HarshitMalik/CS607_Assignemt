  317    Numbers 5 
19  and the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, 
If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to 
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from 
this bitter water that causeth the curse: 
 
20  but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if 
thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thine 
husband: 
 
21  then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and 
the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord make thee a curse 
and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy 
thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; 
 
22  and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to 
make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot. And the woman shall 
say, Amen, amen. 
23  ¶ And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot 
them out with the bitter water: 
 
24  and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth 
the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, 
 
and become bitter. 
25  Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s 
hand, and shall wave the offering before the Lord, and offer it 
upon the altar: 
 
26  and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, even the 
memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall 
cause the woman to drink the water. 
27  And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come 
to pass, that if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her 
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, 
and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: 
 
and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 
28  And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be 
 
free, and shall conceive seed. 
29  ¶ This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another 
instead of her husband, and is defiled;
