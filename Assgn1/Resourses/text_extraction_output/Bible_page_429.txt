  430    Deuteronomy 9 
9 
The Lord Will Destroy the Nations of Canaan 
1  Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to 
 
possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and 
fenced up to heaven, 
2  a people great and tall, the children of the Anakim, whom thou 
knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before 
the children of Anak! 
 
3  Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which 
goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, 
 
and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive 
 
them out, and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath said unto 
thee. 
4  ¶ Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath 
cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the 
Lord hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the 
 
wickedness of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from 
before thee. 
5  Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, 
dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these 
 
nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, 
and that he may perform the word which the Lord sware unto thy 
fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
Israel’s Rebellion at Horeb 
6  ¶ Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not 
this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a 
 
stiffnecked people. 
7  Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy 
God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart 
 
out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been 
rebellious against the Lord.
