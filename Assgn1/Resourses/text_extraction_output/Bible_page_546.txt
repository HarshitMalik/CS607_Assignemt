  547    Joshua 22 
27  but that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our 
generations after us, that we might do the service of the Lord 
before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and 
with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our 
 
children in time to come, Ye have no part in the Lord. 
28  Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or 
to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold 
the pattern of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not 
for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us 
 
and you. 
29  God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this 
day from following the Lord, to build an altar for burnt offerings, 
for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the Lord 
our God that is before his tabernacle. 
30  ¶ And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the 
congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with 
him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children 
of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them. 
31  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of 
Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of 
Manasseh, This day we perceive that the Lord is among us, because 
ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord: now ye have 
 
delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
32  ¶ And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, 
returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of 
Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the 
children of Israel, and brought them word again. 
33  And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of 
 
Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in 
battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad 
dwelt. 
34  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar 
Ed [a witness]: for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is 
 
God.
