Peter and Cornelius 
1  There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion 
of the band called the Italian band, 
2  a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which 
gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. 
3  He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an 
angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. 
4  And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, 
Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come 
 
up for a memorial before God. 
5  And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose 
surname is Peter: 
 
6  he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: 
 
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. 
7  And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he 
called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them 
that waited on him continually; 
 
8  and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them 
to Joppa. 
9  Â¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh 
unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the 
sixth hour: 
 
10  and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they 
 
made ready, he fell into a trance, 
11  and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, 
as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to 
the earth: 
 
12  wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild 
beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
13  And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. 
 
14  But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is 
 
common or unclean.
