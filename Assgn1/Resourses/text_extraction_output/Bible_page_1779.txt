  1780    Ezekiel 16 
2  Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a 
branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
 
3  Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin 
 
of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
 
4  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the 
 
ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? 
 
5  Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much 
 
less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured 
it, and it is burned? 
 
6  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the vine tree among the 
 
trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I 
give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
7  And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, 
 
and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the 
 
Lord, when I set my face against them. 
8  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a 
trespass, saith the Lord God.

Jerusalemâ€™s Unfaithfulness 
1  Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
3  and say, Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and 
 
thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, 
 
and thy mother a Hittite. 
4  And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not 
cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast 
 
not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. 
5  None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have 
compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to 
 
the loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
