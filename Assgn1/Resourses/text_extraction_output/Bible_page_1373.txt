  1374    Psalms 122 
which made heaven and earth. 
3  He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: 
 
he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
4  Behold, he that keepeth Israel 
shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
5  The Lord is thy keeper: 
 
the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
6  The sun shall not smite thee by day, 
nor the moon by night. 
7  The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: 
 
he shall preserve thy soul. 
8  The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in 
from this time forth, and even for evermore.

A Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem 
A Song of degrees of David. 
1  I was glad when they said unto me, 
Let us go into the house of the Lord. 
2  Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
3  Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 
 
4  whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, 
unto the testimony of Israel, 
to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. 
5  For there are set thrones of judgment, 
the thrones of the house of David. 
6  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: 
 
they shall prosper that love thee. 
7  Peace be within thy walls, 
and prosperity within thy palaces. 
8  For my brethren and companionsâ€™ sakes, 
I will now say, Peace be within thee.
