  773    1 Kings 5 
8  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things 
which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning 
 
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 
9  My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and 
 
I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt 
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou 
shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving 
 
food for my household. 
10  So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his 
desire. 
11  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for 
food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave 
 
Solomon to Hiram year by year. 
12  And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and 
 
there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made 
 
a league together. 
13  ¶ And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was 
 
thirty thousand men. 
14  And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a 
 
month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and 
 
Adoniram was over the levy. 
15  And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, 
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
 
16  besides the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, 
three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people 
that wrought in the work. 
17  And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly 
stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 
18  And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and 
the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the 
 
house.
