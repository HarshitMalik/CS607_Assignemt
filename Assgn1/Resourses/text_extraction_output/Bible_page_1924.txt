  1925    Joel 2 
5  Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, 
like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a 
strong people set in battle array.  
6  Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall 
 
gather blackness. 
7  They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men 
 
of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall 
 
not break their ranks: 
 
8  neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his 
 
path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be 
 
wounded. 
9  They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, 
 
they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the 
 
windows like a thief. 
10  The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the 
   
sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their 
shining:  
 
11  and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is 
 
very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of 
   
the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?  
   
The Mercy of the Lord 
12  ¶ Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all 
your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with 
mourning: 
 
13  and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the 
Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and 
 
of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. 
14  Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing 
behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the 
 
Lord your God? 
 
15  ¶ Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
