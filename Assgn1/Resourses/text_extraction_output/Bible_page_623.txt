  624    1 Samuel 2 
answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will 
   
take it by force. 
17  Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the 
Lord: for men abhorred the offering of the Lord. 
 
18  ¶ But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded 
with a linen ephod. 
19  Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him 
from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the 
yearly sacrifice. 
20  And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee 
seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. And 
they went unto their own home. 
21  ¶ And the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare 
three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before 
the Lord. 
22  ¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all 
Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the 
 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
23  And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your 
 
evil dealings by all this people. 
24  Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the 
   
Lord’s people to transgress. 
25  If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a 
 
man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? 
 
Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their 
father, because the Lord would slay them. 
26  ¶ And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the 
Lord, and also with men. 
27  ¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus 
saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, 
when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house? 
 
28  And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to 
offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before 
me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings 
 
made by fire of the children of Israel?
