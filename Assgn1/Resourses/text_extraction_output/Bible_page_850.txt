  851    2 Kings 8 
2  And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: 
 
and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the 
Philistines seven years. 
3  And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman 
returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to 
 
cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 
4  And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, 
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath 
done. 
5  And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored 
a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had 
restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. 
And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her 
son, whom Elisha restored to life. 
6  And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king 
appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was 
hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the 
land, even until now. 
Hazael Becomes King of Syria 
7  ¶ And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria 
 
was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come 
 
hither. 
8  And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and 
go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying, 
Shall I recover of this disease? 
 
9  So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of 
every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and 
stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath 
sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
 
10  And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly 
recover: howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he shall surely 
 
die.
