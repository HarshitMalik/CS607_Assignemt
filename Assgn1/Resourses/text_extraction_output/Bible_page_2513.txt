  2514    Colossians 4 
4 
1  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; 
 
knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.  
2  ¶ Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 
 
3  withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of 
utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in 
bonds: 
 
4  that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
5  ¶ Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the 
time.  
6  Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye 
may know how ye ought to answer every man. 
Final Greetings 
7  ¶ All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved 
brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord: 
 
8  whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might 
know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  
 
9  with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. 
They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. 
10  ¶ Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, sister’s 
son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if 
 
he come unto you, receive him;) 
 
11  and Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These 
only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have 
been a comfort unto me. 
12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, 
always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand 
perfect and complete in all the will of God. 
13  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them 
that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 
14  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
