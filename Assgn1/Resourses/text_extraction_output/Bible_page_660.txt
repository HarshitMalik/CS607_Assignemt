  661    1 Samuel 17 
47  And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with 
sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give you 
 
into our hands. 
48  ¶ And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and 
drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the 
army to meet the Philistine. 
49  And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and 
slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone 
sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 
 
50  ¶ So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a 
stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no 
 
sword in the hand of David. 
51  Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his 
sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut 
off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their 
champion was dead, they fled. 
52  And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and 
pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the 
gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the 
way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
53  And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the 
Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
54  And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to 
Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent. 
 
55  ¶ And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said 
unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this 
youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. 
 
56  And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is. 
57  And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner 
took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the 
Philistine in his hand. 
58  And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And 
 
David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
