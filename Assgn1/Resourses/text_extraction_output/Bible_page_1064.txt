  1065    Ezra 6 
builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the 
foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore 
 
cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 
 
4  with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the 
 
expenses be given out of the king’s house: 
 
5  and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which 
Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, 
and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the 
temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them 
in the house of God. 
6  ¶ Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, 
and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the 
river, be ye far from thence: 
 
7  let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews 
 
and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 
8  Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these 
Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, 
 
even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given 
unto these men, that they be not hindered. 
9  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, 
and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, 
salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests 
which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
 
10  that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of 
heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
11  Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let 
timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be 
hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 
 
12  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all 
kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy 
this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a 
decree; let it be done with speed. 
 
13  ¶ Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and 
their companions, according to that which Darius the king had 
sent, so they did speedily.
