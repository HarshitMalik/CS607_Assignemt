O God, You are pervading all the worlds, solar systems and galaxies.  || 3 ||   You are 
eternal and unchanging, imperishable, invisible and infinite, O divine fascinating Lord. 
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Society of the Saints, and the dust of the feet of 
Your slaves.  || 4 || 6 || 22 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  The Saints are fulfilled and 
satisfied;  they  know  the  Guru‟s  Mantra  and  the  Teachings.  They  cannot  even  be 
described; they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the 
Lord.    ||  1  ||      My  Beloved  is  a  priceless  jewel.  His  Name  is  unattainable  and 
immeasurable.    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||      One  whose  mind  is  satisfied  believing  in  the 
imperishable Lord God, becomes Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom. 
He  sees  all  in  his  meditation.  He  banishes  egotistical  pride  from  his  mind.    ||  2  ||   
Permanent  is  the  place  of  those  who,  through  the  Guru,  realize  the  Mansion  of  the 
Lord‟s Presence. Meeting the Guru, they remain awake and aware night and day; they 
are committed to the Lord‟s service.  || 3 ||   They are perfectly fulfilled and satisfied, 
intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. The Lord‟s treasure comes into their hands; O Nanak, 
through the Guru, they attain it.  || 4 || 7 || 23 ||    
 
MARU,  FIFTH MEHL,  SIXTH HOUSE,  DU-PADAS:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Abandon all your clever tricks; meet with the Holy, and renounce your egotistical pride. 
Everything else is false; with your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam.  || 
1 ||   O my mind, with your ears, listen to the Name of the Lord. The sins of your many 
past lifetimes shall be washed away; then, what can the wretched Messenger of Death 
do to you?  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Pain, poverty and fear shall not afflict you, and you shall 
find peace and pleasure. By Guru‟s Grace, Nanak speaks; meditation on the Lord is the 
essence of spiritual wisdom.  || 2 || 1 || 24 ||   MARU,  FIFTH MEHL:  Those who have 
forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord — I have seen them reduced to dust. The 
love of children and friends, and the pleasures of married life are torn apart.  || 1 ||   O 
my mind, continually, continuously chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You shall 
not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body shall be blessed with peace.  || 1 
||  Pause  ||   Like the shade of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds 
blown  away  by  the  wind.  Meeting  with  the  Holy,  devotional  worship  to  the  Lord  is 
implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for you.  || 2 || 2 || 25 ||   MARU,  
FIFTH MEHL:  The perfect, primal Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you. He 
does not die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not perish, and He 
is not affected by heat or cold.  || 1 ||   O my mind, be in love with the Naam, the 
Name of the Lord. Within the mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the 
purest  way  of  life.    ||  1  ||    Pause    ||      Whoever  meditates  on  the  merciful 
compassionate Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is successful. He is always new, fresh 
and young, clever and beautiful; Nanak‟s mind is pierced through with His Love.  || 2 || 
3  ||  26  ||      MARU,    FIFTH  MEHL:    While  walking  and  sitting, sleeping and waking, 
contemplate within your heart the GurMantra.
