  108    Genesis 44 
dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded 
evil for good? 
 
5  Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he 
divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 
 
6  ¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same 
words. 
7  And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? 
 
God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
 
8  behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we 
brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then 
 
should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? 
 
9  With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and 
we also will be my lord’s bondmen. 
10  And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with 
 
whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 
 
11  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, 
and opened every man his sack. 
12  And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: 
 
and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
13  Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and 
returned to the city. 
14  ¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet 
 
there: and they fell before him on the ground. 
 
15  And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? 
 
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 
 
16  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we 
 
speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the 
   
iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, 
 
and he also with whom the cup is found. 
17  And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose 
 
hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get 
 
you up in peace unto your father.
