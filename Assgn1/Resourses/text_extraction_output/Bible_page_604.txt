  605    Judges 20 
3  (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel 
were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, 
how was this wickedness? 
 
4  And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered 
and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my 
concubine, to lodge. 
5  And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round 
about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my 
 
concubine have they forced, that she is dead. 
6  And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her 
throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they 
 
have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. 
7  Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and 
 
counsel. 
8  ¶ And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us 
go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house. 
9  But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will 
 
go up by lot against it; 
 
10  and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of 
Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten 
thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when 
they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that 
they have wrought in Israel. 
11  So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together 
as one man. 
12  ¶ And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of 
Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you? 
 
13  Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are 
in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from 
Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the 
voice of their brethren the children of Israel: 
 
14  but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of 
the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of 
Israel.
