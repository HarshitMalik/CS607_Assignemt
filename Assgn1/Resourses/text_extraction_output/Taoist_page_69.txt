In  later  generations  false  teaching  became  very  active.
Do  their  words  and  actions  actually  accord  with  the
classics of the sages and the traditions of the wise? If there
is any inconsistency, then it is demonic suggestion.
Learners  of  the  Way  simply  must  collect  their  bodies
and minds securely. To exercise effort apart from body and
mind is not the right way.
Learning the Way is not simply a matter of articulating
it, or even just understanding it. It is absolutely necessary
to  sweep  your  own  heart  clean  of  all  desires  for  things;
then you will spontaneously harmonize with the Way.
The will to learn the Way should be all the firmer if you
are  poor,  all  the  stronger  if  you  are  old.  If  your  will  is
driven  by  ambient  energies  or  taken  away  by  external
things,  that  is  not  the  fault  of  these  energies  or  these
things, but affliction resulting from failure of will.
Just  examine  your  will  critically;  reflect  over  and  over
and you will see where the problem is. Put a stop to it with
intense determination and you will be a changed person.
What  cannot  be  accomplished  if  you  do  it  in  deadly
earnest?  The  mind  of  sages  is  the  same  as  that  of  other
people;  how  could  it  be  only  a  matter  of  constant  clarity
and calm? It is nothing but seeing reality and developing
stability.
When  you  see  reality,  no  illusions  can  confuse  you;
when you develop stability, things cannot shake it or take
it away.
