  1621    Jeremiah 5 
5 
The Sins of Jerusalem and Judah 
1  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, 
and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a 
man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the 
truth; and I will pardon it. 
 
2  And though they say, The Lord liveth; surely they swear falsely. 
 
3  O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken 
 
them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but 
 
they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces 
 
harder than a rock; they have refused to return. 
 
4  ¶ Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they 
   
know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God. 
5  I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for 
 
they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their 
God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the 
 
bonds. 
6  Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the 
evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: 
 
every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because 
 
their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased. 
7  ¶ How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, 
 
and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, 
 
they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops 
in the harlots’ houses. 
8  They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his 
 
neighbor’s wife. 
9  Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my 
   
soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
 
10  ¶ Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: 
   
take away her battlements; for they are not the Lord’s. 
 
11  For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very 
treacherously against me, saith the Lord.
