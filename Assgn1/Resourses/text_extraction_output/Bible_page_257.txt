  258    Leviticus 14 
51  and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be 
 
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a 
skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting 
 
leprosy; it is unclean. 
 
52  He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in 
woolen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for 
 
it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 
 
53  ¶ And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread 
in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing 
of skin; 
 
54  then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the 
plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more: 
 
55  and the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, 
 
behold, if the plague have not changed his color, and the plague be 
not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret 
   
inward, whether it be bare within or without. 
56  ¶ And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark 
after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or 
 
out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 
 
57  and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the 
woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt 
   
burn that wherein the plague is with fire. 
58  And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin 
it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, 
then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. 
59  ¶ This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or 
linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to 
pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. 
14 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He 
 
shall be brought unto the priest:
