  169    Exodus 19 
3  And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out 
of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, 
and tell the children of Israel; 
 
4  Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on 
eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. 
5  Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my 
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all 
people: for all the earth is mine: 
   
6  and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. 
These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of 
Israel. 
7  ¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid 
before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded 
him. 
8  And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord 
hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the 
people unto the Lord. 
9  And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick 
cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and 
believe thee for ever. 
¶ And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord. 
10  And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify 
them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
11  and be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will 
 
come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
12  And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, 
Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch 
the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put 
 
to death: 
 
13  there shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or 
shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the 
   
trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
14  And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and 
sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
