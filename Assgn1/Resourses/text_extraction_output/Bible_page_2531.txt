believed on in the world,

Prediction of Apostasy 
1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some 
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and 
doctrines of devils; 
 
2  speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a 
 
hot iron; 
 
3  forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which 
God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which 
believe and know the truth. 
4  For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be 
received with thanksgiving: 
 
5  for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 
A Good Minister of Jesus Christ

of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
7  But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather 
unto godliness. 
8  For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto 
 
all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which 
is to come. 
9  This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation. 
10  For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in 
the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that 
believe. 
11  ¶ These things command and teach.
