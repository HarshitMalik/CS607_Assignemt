  344    Numbers 14 
The Death of the Ten Evil Spies 
36  ¶ And the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, 
and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing 
up a slander upon the land, 
37  even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, 
died by the plague before the Lord. 
38  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which 
were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. 
The Defeat of Israel at Hormah 
39  ¶ And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and 
 
the people mourned greatly. 
40  And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the 
top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the 
place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned. 
 
41  And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the 
commandment of the Lord? but it shall not prosper. 
 
42  Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten 
 
before your enemies. 
43  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye 
shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord, 
 
therefore the Lord will not be with you. 
44  But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop: nevertheless the ark 
 
of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the 
camp. 
45  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt 
in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto 
Hormah.
