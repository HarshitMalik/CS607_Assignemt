among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when 
Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 
8  and he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto 
your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, 
and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide 
 
the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
9  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half 
tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of 
Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the 
country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they 
were possessed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of 
Moses. 
10  ¶ And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the 
land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad 
and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great 
altar to see to. 
11  And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of 
Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh 
have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders 
of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. 
12  And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation 
of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to 
go up to war against them. 
13  ¶ And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and 
to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the 
land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,

all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of the house of their 
 
fathers among the thousands of Israel. 
15  And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of 
Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and 
they spake with them, saying, 
16  Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What trespass is 
this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away
