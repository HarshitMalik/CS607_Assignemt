  1196    Job 40 
28  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, 
upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
29  From thence she seeketh the prey, 
and her eyes behold afar off. 
30  Her young ones also suck up blood: 
 
and where the slain are, there is she.

1  Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said, 
2  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? 
 
He that reproveth God, let him answer it. 
3  ¶ Then Job answered the Lord, and said, 
4  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? 
   
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 
5  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: 
   
yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 
 
The Manifestations of God’s Power 
6  ¶ Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and 
said, 
7  Gird up thy loins now like a man: 
 
I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 
8  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? 
 
Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
 
9  Hast thou an arm like God? 
 
Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 
 
10  Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; 
 
and array thyself with glory and beauty. 
11  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: 
 
and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. 
12  Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; 
 
and tread down the wicked in their place. 
13  Hide them in the dust together;
