  55    Genesis 24 
52  ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their 
words, he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth. 
53  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, 
and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother 
 
and to her mother precious things. 
54  And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, 
and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, 
 
Send me away unto my master. 
55  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us 
a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. 
 
56  And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath 
prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
 
57  And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. 
58  And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this 
man? And she said, I will go. 
 
59  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and 
Abraham’s servant, and his men. 
60  And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister; 
 
be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess 
the gate of those which hate them. 
61  And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the 
camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and 
 
went his way. 
62  ¶ And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt 
 
in the south country. 
63  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he 
 
lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 
64  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she 
lighted off the camel. 
65  For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in 
the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: 
   
therefore she took a veil, and covered herself. 
66  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
