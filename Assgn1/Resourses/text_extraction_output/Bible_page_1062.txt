24  Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So 
it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

The Temple Rebuilt 
1  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of 
Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in 
the name of the God of Israel, even unto them. 
2  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of 
Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: 
 
and with them were the prophets of God helping them. 
3  ¶ At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the 
river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus 
unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to 
make up this wall? 
 
4  Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of 
the men that make this building? 
 
5  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they 
could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and 
 
then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter. 
6  ¶ The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, 
and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which 
were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 
 
7  they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius 
 
the king, all peace. 
8  Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of 
Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great 
stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, 
and prospereth in their hands. 
9  Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who 
commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? 
 
10  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the 
names of the men that were the chief of them.
