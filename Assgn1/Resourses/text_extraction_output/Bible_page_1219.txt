  1220    Psalms 18 
26  with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; 
 
and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward. 
27  For thou wilt save the afflicted people; 
 
but wilt bring down high looks. 
28  For thou wilt light my candle: 
 
the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. 
29  For by thee I have run through a troop; 
 
and by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
30  As for God, his way is perfect: 
 
the word of the Lord is tried: 
 
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. 
31  For who is God save the Lord? 
 
Or who is a rock save our God? 
 
32  It is God that girdeth me with strength, 
and maketh my way perfect. 
33  He maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet,  
and setteth me upon my high places. 
34  He teacheth my hands to war, 
so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
35  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: 
 
and thy right hand hath holden me up, 
and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
36  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, 
that my feet did not slip. 
37  I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: 
 
neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
38  I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: 
 
they are fallen under my feet. 
39  For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: 
 
thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
40  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; 
 
that I might destroy them that hate me. 
41  They cried, but there was none to save them: 
 
even unto the Lord, but he answered them not. 
42  Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
