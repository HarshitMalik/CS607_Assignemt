  1931    Amos 2 
delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the 
brotherly covenant: 
 
10  but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the 
palaces thereof. 
11  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Edom, and for 
 
four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did 
 
pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his 
anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: 
 
12  but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of 
Bozrah. 
13  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of the children of 
 
Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; 
 
because they have ripped up the women with child, of Gilead, that 
they might enlarge their border: 
 
14  but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest 
in the day of the whirlwind: 
 
15  and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, 
saith the Lord.

1  Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Moab, and for 
 
four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned 
 
the bones of the king of Edom into lime: 
 
2  but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of 
Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with 
 
the sound of the trumpet: 
 
3  and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all 
the princes thereof with him, saith the Lord. 
4  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Judah, and for 
 
four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have 
 
despised the law of the Lord, and have not kept his 
commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which 
their fathers have walked:
