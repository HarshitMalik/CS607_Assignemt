  1840    Ezekiel 38 
5  Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and 
 
helmet: 
 
6  Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north 
 
quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee. 
 
7  ¶ Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy 
company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto 
them. 
8  After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt 
 
come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is 
gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, 
which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the 
 
nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. 
9  Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud 
to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with 
thee. 
10  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; It shall also come to pass, that at the 
 
same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an 
evil thought: 
 
11  and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I 
 
will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them 
dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
12  to take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the 
 
desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are 
gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, 
that dwell in the midst of the land. 
13  Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the 
young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a 
spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry 
   
away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great 
spoil? 
 
14  ¶ Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith 
the Lord God; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth 
 
safely, shalt thou not know it?
