  312    Numbers 4 
11  And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and 
cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to the staves 
thereof: 
 
12  and they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they 
minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover 
them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put them on a bar. 
13  And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a 
purple cloth thereon: 
 
14  and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they 
minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, 
and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread 
 
upon it a covering of badgers’ skins, and put to the staves of it. 
15  And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the 
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set 
forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but 
   
they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are 
the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the 
congregation. 
16  ¶ And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth 
the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat 
offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the 
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the 
vessels thereof. 
17  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
18  Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from 
among the Levites: 
 
19  but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they 
approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, 
 
and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 
 
20  but they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest 
they die. 
21  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
22  Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of 
their fathers, by their families:
