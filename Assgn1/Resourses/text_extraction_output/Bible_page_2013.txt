  2014    Matthew 2 
The Slaying of the Infants 
13  ¶ And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord 
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young 
child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I 
bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy 
 
him. 
14  When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, 
and departed into Egypt: 
 
15  and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled 
 
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt 
have I called my son.  
16  ¶ Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, 
was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that 
were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old 
and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired 
of the wise men. 
17  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, 
saying, 
18  In Ramah was there a voice heard, 
lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, 
Rachel weeping for her children, 
and would not be comforted, 
because they are not.  
19  ¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord 
appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
20  saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into 
the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s 
 
life. 
21  And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came 
into the land of Israel. 
22  But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the room of 
his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, 
 
being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of 
Galilee:
