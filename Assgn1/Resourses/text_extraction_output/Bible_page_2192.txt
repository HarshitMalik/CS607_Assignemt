  2193    Luke 11 
12  Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 
 
13  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your 
children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy 
 
Spirit to them that ask him? 
 
A Divided House Cannot Stand 
14  ¶ And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to 
pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people 
 
wondered. 
15  But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the 
chief of the devils.  
16  And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.  
17  But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom 
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided 
 
against a house falleth. 
18  If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom 
stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. 
 
19  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast 
them out? therefore shall they be your judges. 
 
20  But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the 
kingdom of God is come upon you. 
21  When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in 
peace: 
 
22  but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome 
him, he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and 
divideth his spoils. 
23  He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not 
 
with me scattereth. 
The Return of the Unclean Spirit 
24  ¶ When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh 
through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will 
 
return unto my house whence I came out.
