  1639    Jeremiah 13 
12  The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: 
 
for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land 
even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. 
 
13  They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put 
 
themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed 
 
of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the Lord. 
14  Â¶ Thus saith the Lord against all mine evil neighbors, that touch 
the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; 
 
Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house 
of Judah from among them. 
15  And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will 
return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, 
every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
16  And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of 
my people, to swear by my name, The Lord liveth; as they taught 
 
my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of 
 
my people. 
17  But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that 
nation, saith the Lord.

The Lesson from the Marred Girdle 
1  Thus saith the Lord unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and 
put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. 
2  So I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it on 
my loins. 
3  And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, 
4  Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and 
arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. 
5  So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. 
6  And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said unto me, 
Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I 
commanded thee to hide there.
