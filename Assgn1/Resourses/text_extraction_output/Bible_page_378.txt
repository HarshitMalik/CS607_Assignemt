  379    Numbers 27 
62  And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three 
thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were 
 
not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no 
inheritance given them among the children of Israel. 
Only Caleb and Joshua Survive 
63  ¶ These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the 
priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab 
by Jordan near Jericho. 
64  But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and 
Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of 
Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 
65  For the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the 
wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the 
son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

The Request of Zelophehad’s Daughters 
1  Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the 
son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the 
families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of 
 
his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and 
 
Tirzah. 
2  And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and 
before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
3  Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company 
of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the 
company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 
 
4  Why should the name of our father be done away from among his 
family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession 
 
among the brethren of our father.
