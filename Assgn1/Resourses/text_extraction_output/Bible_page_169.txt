  170    Exodus 20 
15  And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come 
 
not at your wives. 
16  Â¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there 
were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, 
and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people 
 
that was in the camp trembled. 
17  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with 
God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
 
18  And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord 
descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the 
 
smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
19  And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed 
louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
20  And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the 
mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and 
   
Moses went up. 
21  And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest 
they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them 
perish. 
22  And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify 
themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them. 
23  And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to 
mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the 
 
mount, and sanctify it. 
24  And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt 
come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the 
 
people break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break 
forth upon them. 
25  So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
