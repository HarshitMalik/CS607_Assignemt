  1439    Proverbs 21 
27  The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, 
searching all the inward parts of the belly. 
28  Mercy and truth preserve the king: 
 
and his throne is upholden by mercy. 
29  The glory of young men is their strength: 
 
and the beauty of old men is the gray head. 
30  The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil:

and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. 
5  The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; 
 
but of every one that is hasty only to want. 
6  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue 
is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 
7  The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; 
 
because they refuse to do judgment. 
8  The way of man is froward and strange: 
 
but as for the pure, his work is right. 
9  It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, 
than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 
10  The soul of the wicked desireth evil: 
 
his neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. 
11  When the scorner is punished, 
the simple is made wise: 
 
and when the wise is instructed,
