  1247    Psalms 37 
22  For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; 
 
and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. 
23  The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: 
 
and he delighteth in his way. 
24  Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: 
 
for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. 
25  I have been young, and now am old; 
 
yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, 
nor his seed begging bread. 
26  He is ever merciful, and lendeth; 
 
and his seed is blessed. 
27  Depart from evil, and do good; 
 
and dwell for evermore. 
28  For the Lord loveth judgment, 
and forsaketh not his saints; 
 
they are preserved for ever: 
 
but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 
29  The righteous shall inherit the land, 
and dwell therein for ever. 
30  The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, 
and his tongue talketh of judgment. 
31  The law of his God is in his heart; 
 
none of his steps shall slide. 
32  The wicked watcheth the righteous, 
and seeketh to slay him. 
33  The Lord will not leave him in his hand, 
nor condemn him when he is judged. 
34  Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, 
and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: 
 
when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. 
35  I have seen the wicked in great power, 
and spreading himself like a green bay tree. 
36  Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: 
 
yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 
37  Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright:
