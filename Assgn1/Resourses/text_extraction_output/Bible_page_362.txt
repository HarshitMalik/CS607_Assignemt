  363    Numbers 21 
22  Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or 
 
into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but 
   
we will go along by the kingâ€™s high way, until we be past thy 
borders. 
23  And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but 
 
Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel 
into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against 
 
Israel. 
24  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his 
land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: 
 
for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
25  And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of 
 
the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 
26  For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who 
had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land 
out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 
27  Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, 
Come into Heshbon, 
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 
 
28  for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, 
a flame from the city of Sihon: 
 
it hath consumed Ar of Moab, 
and the lords of the high places of Arnon. 
29  Woe to thee, Moab! 
 
Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: 
 
he hath given his sons that escaped, 
and his daughters, into captivity 
unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 
30  We have shot at them; 
 
Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, 
and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, 
which reacheth unto Medeba.
