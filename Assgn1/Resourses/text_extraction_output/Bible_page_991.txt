  992    2 Chronicles 10 
22  ¶ And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and 
wisdom. 
23  And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to 
hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 
24  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and 
vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, 
a rate year by year. 
25  And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and 
twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot 
 
cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
26  And he reigned over all the kings from the river [Euphrates] even 
unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.  
27  And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees 
made he as the sycamore trees that are in the low plains in 
abundance. 
28  And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all 
lands. 
The Death of Solomon 
29  ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not 
written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of 
Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
 
30  And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
31  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city 
of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

Israel’s Revolt 
1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel 
 
come to make him king.
