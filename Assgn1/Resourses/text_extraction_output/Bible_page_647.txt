side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one 
 
was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
5  The forefront of the one was situate northward over against 
Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. 
6  Â¶ And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, 
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may 
 
be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the 
 
Lord to save by many or by few. 
7  And his armor-bearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: 
 
turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. 
 
8  Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and 
we will discover ourselves unto them. 
9  If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will 
 
stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
10  But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the 
   
Lord hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be a sign 
 
unto us. 
11  And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the 
Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come 
 
forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
12  And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-
bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And 
Jonathan said unto his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the 
 
Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 
13  And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and 
his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his 
   
armor-bearer slew after him. 
14  And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer 
made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half acre of land, 
which a yoke of oxen might plow. 
15  And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the 
people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the 
 
earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
