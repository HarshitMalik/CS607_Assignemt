  1896    Daniel 9 
19  O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, 
     
for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are 
 
called by thy name. 
The Prophecy concerning the Seventy Weeks 
20  ¶ And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin 
and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication 
before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; 
 
21  yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I 
had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, 
touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 
22  And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am 
now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. 
23  At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came 
forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: 
   
therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. 
24  ¶ Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy 
holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, 
and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting 
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to 
anoint the Most Holy. 
25  Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the 
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah 
the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the 
 
street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. 
26  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but 
not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall 
 
destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with 
 
a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 
27  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in 
 
the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation 
to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it 
desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall 
be poured upon the desolate.
