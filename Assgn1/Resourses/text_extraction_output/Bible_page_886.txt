  887    2 Kings 20 
8  ¶ And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the 
Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the 
Lord the third day? 
 
9  And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the 
Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go 
 
forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 
 
10  And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go 
down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten 
 
degrees. 
11  And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord: and he brought the 
 
shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the 
dial of Ahaz. 
Hezekiah Receives Envoys from Babylon 
12  ¶ At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of 
Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard 
 
that Hezekiah had been sick. 
13  And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the 
house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, 
and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all 
that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor 
 
in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. 
14  Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto 
him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? 
   
And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from 
Babylon. 
15  And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah 
 
answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there 
 
is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them. 
16  ¶ And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord. 
17  Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that 
which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be 
carried unto Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.
