  2258    John 6 
17  and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. 
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
18  And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 
19  So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, 
they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: 
 
and they were afraid. 
20  But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 
 
21  Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately 
 
the ship was at the land whither they went. 
The People Seek Jesus 
22  ¶ The day following, when the people, which stood on the other 
side of the sea, saw that there was none other boat there, save that 
one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not 
with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone 
away alone; 
 
23  (howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place 
where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) 
 
24  when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his 
disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking 
for Jesus. 
Jesus the Bread of Life 
25  ¶ And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they 
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 
 
26  Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek 
me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the 
loaves, and were filled. 
27  Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which 
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give 
unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 
 
28  Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work 
the works of God?
