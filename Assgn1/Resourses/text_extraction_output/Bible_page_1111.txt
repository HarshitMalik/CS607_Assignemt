Queen Vashti Defies King Ahasuerus 
1  Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus 
which reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and 
seven and twenty provinces,) 
2  that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his 
kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 
3  in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes 
and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and 
 
princes of the provinces, being before him: 
 
4  when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor 
of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore 
days. 
5  And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all 
the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great 
and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s 
palace; 
 
6  where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of 
fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds 
 
were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and 
white, and black marble. 
7  And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being 
diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according 
to the state of the king. 
8  And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so 
   
the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they 
should do according to every man’s pleasure. 
9  Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal 
house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
