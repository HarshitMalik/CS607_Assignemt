  2482    Galatians 4 
17  And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God 
in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, 
cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. 
18  For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but 
 
God gave it to Abraham by promise. 
The Purpose of the Law 
19  ¶ Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of 
 
transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was 
made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 
 
20  Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. 
21  ¶ Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if 
   
there had been a law given which could have given life, verily 
righteousness should have been by the law. 
22  But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by 
faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
23  ¶ But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto 
the faith which should afterward be revealed. 
24  Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, 
that we might be justified by faith. 
25  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
26  For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
27  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on 
Christ. 
28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, 
there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 
 
29  And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs 
according to the promise.

1  Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing 
from a servant, though he be lord of all;
