  1313    Psalms 83 
6  I have said, Ye are gods;  
 
and all of you are children of the Most High. 
7  But ye shall die like men, 
and fall like one of the princes. 
8  Arise, O God, judge the earth: 
 
for thou shalt inherit all nations.

A Prayer for the Destruction of Israelâ€™s Enemies 
A Song or Psalm of Asaph. 
1  Keep not thou silence, O God: 
 
hold not thy peace, 
and be not still, O God. 
2  For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: 
 
and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
3  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, 
and consulted against thy hidden ones. 
4  They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; 
 
that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
5  For they have consulted together with one consent: 
 
they are confederate against thee: 
 
6  the tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; 
 
of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
 
7  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; 
 
the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
 
8  Assur also is joined with them: 
 
they have helped the children of Lot. 
Selah. 
9  Do unto them as unto the Midianites;  
 
as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:  
 
10  which perished at En-dor: 
 
they became as dung for the earth.
