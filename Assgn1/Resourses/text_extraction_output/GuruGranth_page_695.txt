JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL,  FIRST HOUSE,  CHAU-PADAS:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The Jewel of the Lord‟s Name abides within my heart; the Guru has placed His hand on 
my  forehead.  The  sins  and  pains  of  countless  incarnations  have  been  cast  out.  The 
Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and my debt has been paid 
off.  || 1 ||   O my mind, vibrate the Lord‟s Name, and all your affairs shall be resolved. 
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord‟s Name within me; without the Name, life is 
useless.  ||  Pause  ||   Without the Guru, the self-willed manmukhs are foolish and 
ignorant;  they  are  forever  entangled  in  emotional  attachment  to  Maya.  They  never 
serve the feet of the Holy; their lives are totally useless.  || 2 ||   Those who serve at 
the feet of the Holy, the feet of the Holy, their lives are made fruitful, and they belong 
to the Lord. Make me the slave of the slave of the slaves of the Lord; bless me with 
Your Mercy, O Lord of the Universe.  || 3 ||   I am blind, ignorant and totally without 
wisdom; how can I walk on the Path? I am blind — O Guru, please let me grasp the 
hem of Your robe, so that servant Nanak may walk in harmony with You.  || 4 || 1 ||   
JAITSREE,  FOURTH MEHL:  A jewel or a diamond may be very valuable and heavy, but 
without a purchaser, it is worth only straw. When the Holy Guru, the Purchaser, saw 
this jewel, He purchased it for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  || 1 ||   The Lord has 
kept this jewel hidden within my mind. The Lord, merciful to the meek, led me to meet 
the Holy Guru; meeting the Guru, I came to appreciate this jewel.  ||  Pause  ||   The 
rooms of the self-willed manmukhs are dark with ignorance; in their homes, the jewel is 
not  visible.  Those  fools  die,  wandering  in  the  wilderness,  eating  the  poison  of  the 
snake, Maya.  || 2 ||   O Lord, Har, Har, let me meet the humble, holy beings; O Lord, 
keep me in the Sanctuary of the Holy. O Lord, make me Your own; O God, Lord and 
Master, I have hurried to Your side.  || 3 ||   What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I speak 
and  describe?  You  are  great  and  unfathomable,  the  Greatest  Being.  The  Lord  has 
bestowed His Mercy on servant Nanak;
