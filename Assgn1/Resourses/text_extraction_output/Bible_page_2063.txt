  2064    Matthew 20 
22  But when the young man heard that saying, he went away 
sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 
 
23  ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a 
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
24  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the 
eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of 
God. 
25  When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, 
Who then can be saved? 
 
26  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is 
impossible; but with God all things are possible. 
 
27  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken 
all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? 
   
28  And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which 
have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall 
sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  
29  And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or 
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s 
sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. 
30  But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

Laborers in the Vineyard 
1  For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, 
which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his 
vineyard. 
2  And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he 
sent them into his vineyard. 
3  And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle 
in the market place, 
4  and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is 
 
right I will give you. And they went their way.
