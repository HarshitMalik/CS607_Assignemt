  2017    Matthew 4 
He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:  
 
and in their hands they shall bear thee up, 
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
7  Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the 
Lord thy God.  
8  Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, 
and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of 
them; 
 
9  and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall 
down and worship me. 
10  Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, 
 
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, 
and him only shalt thou serve.  
11  Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and 
ministered unto him. 
Jesus Begins His Ministry 
12  Â¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he 
departed into Galilee; 
 
13  and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is 
upon the seacoast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: 
 
14  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, 
saying, 
15  The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, 
by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, 
Galilee of the Gentiles; 
 
16  the people which sat in darkness saw great light; 
 
and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death 
light is sprung up.  
17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the 
 
kingdom of heaven is at hand.
