  2054    Matthew 16 
31  insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb 
to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind 
to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
 
The Feeding of the Four Thousand 
32  Â¶ Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have 
compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now 
three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away 
 
fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
33  And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much 
bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 
 
34  And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they 
 
said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 
35  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
36  And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and 
brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the 
multitude. 
37  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the 
 
broken meat that was left seven baskets full. 
38  And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and 
children. 
39  And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the 
coasts of Magdala.

The Demand for a Sign 
1  The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired 
him that he would show them a sign from heaven. 
2  He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will 
be fair weather: for the sky is red.
