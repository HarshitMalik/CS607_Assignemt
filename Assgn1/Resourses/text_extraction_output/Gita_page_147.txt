THE YOGA OF LIBERATION BY RENUNCIATION
Yayaa tu dharmakaamaarthaan dhrityaa dhaarayate’rjuna;
Prasangena phalaakaangkshee dhritih saa paartha raajasee.
34. But that firmness, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward,
one holds fast to Dharma, enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealth—that firmness, O Arjuna,
is Rajasic!
Yayaa swapnam bhayam shokam vishaadam madameva cha;
Na vimunchati durmedhaa dhritih saa paartha taamasee.
35. That by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also
conceit—that firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic!
Sukham twidaaneem trividham shrinu me bharatarshabha;
Abhyaasaadramate yatra duhkhaantam cha nigacchati.
36. Now hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices by
practice and surely comes to the end of pain!
Yattadagre vishamiva parinaame’mritopamam;
Tatsukham saattwikam proktam aatmabuddhiprasaadajam.
37. That which is like poison at first but in the end like nectar—that pleasure is declared to
be Sattwic, born of the purity of one’s own mind due to Self-realisation.
Vishayendriya samyogaad yattadagre’mritopamam;
Parinaame vishamiva tatsukham raajasam smritam.
38. That pleasure which arises from the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which
is at first like nectar and in the end like poison—that is declared to be Rajasic.
Yadagre chaanubandhe cha sukham mohanamaatmanah;
Nidraalasyapramaadottham tattaamasamudaahritam.
39. That pleasure which at first and in the sequel is delusive of the self, arising from sleep,
indolence and heedlessness—such a pleasure is declared to be Tamasic.
Na tadasti prithivyaam vaa divi deveshu vaa punah;
Sattwam prakritijairmuktam yadebhih syaat tribhirgunaih.
40. There is no being on earth or again in heaven among the gods that is liberated from the
three qualities born of Nature.
Braahmanakshatriyavishaam shoodraanaam cha parantapa;
Karmaani pravibhaktaani swabhaavaprabhavairgunaih.
