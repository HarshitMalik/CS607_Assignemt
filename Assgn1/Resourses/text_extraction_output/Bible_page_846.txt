he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots 
 
of fire round about Elisha. 
18  And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, 
and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he 
smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 
19  And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the 
city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But 
 
he led them to Samaria. 
20  ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that 
Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. 
And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they 
 
were in the midst of Samaria. 
21  And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My 
father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them? 
   
22  And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite 
 
those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy 
bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, 
 
and go to their master. 
23  And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had 
 
eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. 
So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 
Elisha and the Siege of Samaria 
24  ¶ And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria 
gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
25  And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they 
 
besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, 
and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver. 
26  And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a 
woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
27  And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help 
thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
