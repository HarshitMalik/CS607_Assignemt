  74    Genesis 31 
15  Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath 
 
quite devoured also our money. 
16  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is 
ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto 
 
thee, do. 
Jacob Flees from Laban 
17  ¶ Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
 
18  and he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had 
gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-
aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 
19  And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the 
 
images that were her father’s. 
20  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told 
him not that he fled. 
21  So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the 
 
river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 
22  ¶ And it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob was fled. 
23  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven 
days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 
 
24  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said 
unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or 
bad. 
25  ¶ Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in 
the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of 
 
Gilead. 
26  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast 
stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as 
captives taken with the sword? 
 
27  Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; 
 
and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, 
and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
 
28  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou 
 
hast now done foolishly in so doing.
