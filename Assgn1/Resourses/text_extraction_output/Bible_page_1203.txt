  1204    Psalms 4 
4  I cried unto the Lord with my voice, 
and he heard me out of his holy hill. 
Selah. 
5  I laid me down and slept; 
 
I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. 
 
6  I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, 
that have set themselves against me round about. 
7  Arise, O Lord; 
 
save me, O my God: 
 
for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; 
 
thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
8  Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: 
 
thy blessing is upon thy people. 
Selah.

An Evening Prayer of Trust in God 
To the chief Musician on Neginoth,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Hear me when I call, 
O God of my righteousness: 
 
thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; 
 
have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
2  O ye sons of men, 
how long will ye turn my glory into shame? 
 
How long will ye love vanity, 
and seek after leasing? 
 
Selah. 
3  But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for 
himself: 
 
the Lord will hear when I call unto him. 
4  Stand in awe, and sin not:
