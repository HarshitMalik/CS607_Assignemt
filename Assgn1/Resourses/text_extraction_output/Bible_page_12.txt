  13    Genesis 5 
21  And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as 
 
handle the harp and organ. 
22  And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer 
in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 
 
23  ¶ And Lamech said unto his wives, 
Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; 
 
ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: 
 
for I have slain a man to my wounding, 
and a young man to my hurt. 
24  If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, 
truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 
25  ¶ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his 
 
name Seth [appointed, or put]: For God, said she, hath appointed 
 
me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 
26  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his 
 
name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.

The Descendants of Adam 
1  This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God 
created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 
 
2  male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called 
 
their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 
3  And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his 
own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: 
   
4  and the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight 
hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 
   
5  and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty 
years: and he died. 
 
6  ¶ And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 
 
7  and Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, 
and begat sons and daughters:
