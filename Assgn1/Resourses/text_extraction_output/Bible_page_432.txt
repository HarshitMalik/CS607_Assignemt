  433    Deuteronomy 10 
10 
The Second Tables of Stone 
1  At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone 
like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make 
thee an ark of wood. 
2  And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables 
which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
3  And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone 
like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two 
tables in mine hand. 
4  And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten 
commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount, 
out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the 
 
Lord gave them unto me. 
5  And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the 
tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord 
 
commanded me. 
6  ¶ And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the 
children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was 
 
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his 
 
stead. 
7  From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah 
 
to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 
8  At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of 
the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister 
unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 
9  Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the 
 
Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised 
him. 
10  ¶ And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days 
and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time 
 
also, and the Lord would not destroy thee.
