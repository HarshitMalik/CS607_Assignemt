Jerusalem and the Nations 
1  Behold, the day the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in 
the midst of thee. 
2  For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city 
 
shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and 
 
half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the 
people shall not be cut off from the city. 
3  Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as 
when he fought in the day of battle. 
4  And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,

mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled 
 
from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: 
 
and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.

nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be 
 
light. 
8  ¶ And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from 
Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them 
 
toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. 
 
9  ¶ And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall 
 
there be one Lord, and his name one. 
10  ¶ All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon 
south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her 
 
place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the
