  2104    Mark 3 
A Divided House Cannot Stand 
20  And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so 
much as eat bread. 
21  And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: 
 
for they said, He is beside himself. 
22  And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath 
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.  
23  And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How 
can Satan cast out Satan? 
 
24  And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot 
stand. 
25  And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 
26  And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot 
stand, but hath an end. 
27  No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, 
except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his 
 
house. 
28  ¶ Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of 
men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
 
29  but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never 
forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 
 
30  because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. 
Jesus’ Mother and Brethren 
31  ¶ There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing 
without, sent unto him, calling him. 
32  And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, 
thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 
33  And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my 
brethren? 
 
34  And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, 
Behold my mother and my brethren!
