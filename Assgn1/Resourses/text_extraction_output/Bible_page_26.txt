  27    Genesis 12 
12 
God’s Call to Abram 
1  Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, 
and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that 
I will show thee:  
 
2  and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and 
make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 
   
3  and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth 
thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.  
 
4  ¶ So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot 
 
went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he 
 
departed out of Haran. 
5  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all 
their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had 
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of 
 
Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
 
6  And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto 
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. 
7  And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I 
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who 
 
appeared unto him. 
8  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-
el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the 
east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon 
 
the name of the Lord. 
9  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 
Abram in Egypt 
10  ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into 
 
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
