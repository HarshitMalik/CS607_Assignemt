Some ask how to keep the spiritual light always present.
It seems essential to be respectful.
Only  by  respecting  it  can  the  spiritual  light  be  kept
always  present.  Carefulness  and  caution  are  certainly
respect; industriousness is also respect.
When you are respectful, you do not entertain fantasies,
you  do  not  slip  into  oblivion,  and  you  do  not  dwell  in
fullness.  These  seem  to  be  essential  to  presence  of  mind,
guidelines for self-cultivation.
Since ancient times sages have transmitted the heart by
these  means.  Nowadays  people  think  that  formal  dress
naturally  produces  respect.  Respect  is  just  a  matter  of
being  centered  in  oneness.  When  you  are  centered  in
oneness, you are naturally free from warp and bias.
The mind is the master of the body; respectfulness is an
attainment  of  the  mind.  Nowadays  when  people  enter  a
shrine  they  become  respectful  because  there  are  sacred
images there—why do they not think how there are a real
ghost  and  spirit  in  their  own  bodies,  and  do  not  know
enough to respect them?
Cheng  Mingdao  said,  “When  I  practice  calligraphy,  I
am extremely respectful of it, not because I insist that the
characters be good, but simply because this is study.”
Cheng  Yinquan  said,  “When  Master  Zhou  spoke  of
oneness,  he  meant  having  no  desire.  How  can  ordinary
people  attain  desirelessness?  It  is  just  a  matter  of
respectfulness.  Keep  at  it  step  after  step;  hold  it  steady.
Just  work  like  this,  alerting  yourself  time  and  again,  not
