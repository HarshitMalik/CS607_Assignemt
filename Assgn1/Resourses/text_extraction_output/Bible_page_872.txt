  873    2 Kings 16 
The Reign of Jotham 
32  ¶ In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel 
began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. 
33  Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he 
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 
34  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he did 
 
according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 
35  Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed 
 
and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate 
of the house of the Lord. 
36  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
 
37  In those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king 
of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 
38  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers 
in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his 
 
stead.

The Reign of Ahaz 
1  In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son 
of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 
2  Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned 
sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the 
sight of the Lord his God, like David his father. 
3  But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his 
son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the 
heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of 
Israel.  
4  And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the 
hills, and under every green tree.
