  1686    Jeremiah 32 
kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men 
of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
33  And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I 
 
taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not 
hearkened to receive instruction. 
34  But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my 
name, to defile it.  
35  And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the 
son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass 
through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, 
 
neither came it into my mind, that they should do this 
abomination, to cause Judah to sin. 
36  ¶ And now therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, 
concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the 
hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and 
by the pestilence; 
 
37  Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have 
driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and 
 
I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to 
dwell safely: 
 
38  and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
 
39  and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me 
for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: 
 
40  and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not 
turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in 
 
their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. 
41  Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them 
in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole 
soul. 
42  ¶ For thus saith the Lord; Like as I have brought all this great evil 
 
upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have 
promised them. 
43  And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate 
without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
