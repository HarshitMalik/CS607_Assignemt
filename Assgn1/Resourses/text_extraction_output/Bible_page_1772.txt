Ezekiel Portrays the Removal into Captivity 
1  The word of the Lord also came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which 
have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: 
   
for they are a rebellious house. 
3  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and 
remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place 
 
to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though 
 
they be a rebellious house. 
4  Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff 
for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they 
 
that go forth into captivity. 
5  Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. 
6  In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it 
forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the 
 
ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel. 
 
7  ¶ And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by 
 
day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall 
with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it 
 
upon my shoulder in their sight. 
8  ¶ And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, 
9  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said 
unto thee, What doest thou? 
 
10  Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; This burden 
 
concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that 
are among them. 
11  Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto 
 
them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
