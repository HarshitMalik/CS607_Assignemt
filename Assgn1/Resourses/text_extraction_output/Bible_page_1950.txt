  1951    Jonah 4 
6  Â¶ And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up 
over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him 
from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. 
7  But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and 
it smote the gourd that it withered. 
8  And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a 
vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that 
 
he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me 
to die than to live. 
9  And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? 
 
And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. 
10  Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the 
which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came 
 
up in a night, and perished in a night: 
 
11  and should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more 
than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their 
right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
