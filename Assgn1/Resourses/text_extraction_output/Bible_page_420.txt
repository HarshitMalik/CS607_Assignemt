  421    Deuteronomy 5 
4  The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the 
midst of the fire, 
5  (I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to show you the 
word of the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and 
 
went not up into the mount,) saying, 
6  ¶ I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of 
Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
7  ¶ Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
8  ¶ Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any 
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
is in the waters beneath the earth: 
 
9  thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I 
 
the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of 
them that hate me, 
10  and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep 
my commandments.  
11  ¶ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for 
 
the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
12  ¶ Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath 
commanded thee.  
13  Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work: 
 
14  but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou 
 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy 
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor 
any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy 
 
manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. 
15  And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and 
that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty 
hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God 
 
commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. 
16  ¶ Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath 
commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may 
 
go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  
17  ¶ Thou shalt not kill.
