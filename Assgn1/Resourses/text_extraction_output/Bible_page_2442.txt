  2443    1 Corinthians 11 
18  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that 
there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
 
19  For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are 
approved may be made manifest among you. 
20  When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat 
the Lord’s supper. 
21  For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one 
 
is hungry, and another is drunken. 
22  What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the 
   
church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to 
 
you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. 
   
The Institution of the Lord’s Supper 
23  ¶ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto 
you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, 
took bread: 
 
24  and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this 
 
is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
 
25  After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft 
 
as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 
26  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the 
Lord’s death till he come. 
Partaking of the Supper Unworthily 
27  ¶ Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of 
the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the 
Lord. 
28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and 
drink of that cup. 
29  For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh 
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
