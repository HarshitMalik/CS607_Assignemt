  1151    Job 14 
and let not thy dread make me afraid. 
22  Then call thou, and I will answer: 
 
or let me speak, and answer thou me. 
23  How many are mine iniquities and sins? 
 
Make me to know my transgression and my sin. 
24  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, 
and holdest me for thine enemy? 
 
25  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? 
 
And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 
 
26  For thou writest bitter things against me, 
and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 
27  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, 
and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; 
 
thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 
28  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, 
as a garment that is moth-eaten.

he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.

and bringest me into judgment with thee? 
 
4  Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? 
 
Not one.

the number of his months are with thee, 
thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 
 
6  turn from him, that he may rest, 
till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
