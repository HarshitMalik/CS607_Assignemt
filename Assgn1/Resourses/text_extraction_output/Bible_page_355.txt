  356    Numbers 19 
27  And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though 
it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the 
winepress. 
28  Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the Lord of all your 
tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give 
 
thereof the Lordâ€™s heave offering to Aaron the priest. 
29  Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord, 
of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. 
30  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best 
thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the 
increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
31  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is 
 
your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
32  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from 
it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the 
 
children of Israel, lest ye die.

The Purification of the Unclean 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
2  This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded, 
saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red 
heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never 
came yoke. 
3  And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her 
forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: 
 
4  and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and 
sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the 
congregation seven times. 
5  And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, 
 
and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
 
6  and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and 
cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
