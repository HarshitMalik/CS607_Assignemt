  1620    Jeremiah 4 
22  For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish 
 
children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do 
 
evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. 
23  ¶ I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the 
 
heavens, and they had no light. 
24  I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills 
moved lightly. 
25  I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens 
were fled. 
26  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the 
cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and 
by his fierce anger. 
27  ¶ For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; 
 
yet will I not make a full end. 
28  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: 
 
because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, 
neither will I turn back from it. 
29  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and 
bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: 
   
every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. 
30  And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou 
 
clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with 
ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in 
vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they 
 
will seek thy life. 
31  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as 
of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter 
of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, 
Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
