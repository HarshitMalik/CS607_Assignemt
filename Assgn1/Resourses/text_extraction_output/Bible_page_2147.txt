47  And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he 
was laid.

The Resurrection 
1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the 
mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they 
might come and anoint him. 
2  And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came 
unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 
3  And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone 
from the door of the sepulchre? 
 
4  And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for 
 
it was very great. 
5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on 
the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were 
 
affrighted. 
6  And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of 
 
Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold 
     
the place where they laid him. 
7  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before 
you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
 
8  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they 
 
trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; 
   
for they were afraid. 
Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene 
9  Â¶ Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he 
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven 
devils. 
10  And she went and told them that had been with him, as they 
mourned and wept.
