  1399    Psalms 148 
15  He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: 
 
his word runneth very swiftly. 
16  He giveth snow like wool: 
 
he scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. 
17  He casteth forth his ice like morsels: 
 
who can stand before his cold? 
 
18  He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: 
 
he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 
19  He showeth his word unto Jacob, 
his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 
20  He hath not dealt so with any nation: 
 
and as for his judgments, they have not known them. 
Praise ye the Lord. 
148 
All Creation Exhorted to Praise the Lord 
1  Praise ye the Lord. 
Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: 
 
praise him in the heights. 
2  Praise ye him, all his angels: 
 
praise ye him, all his hosts. 
3  Praise ye him, sun and moon: 
 
praise him, all ye stars of light. 
4  Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, 
and ye waters that be above the heavens. 
5  Let them praise the name of the Lord: 
 
for he commanded, and they were created. 
6  He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: 
 
he hath made a decree which shall not pass. 
7  Praise the Lord from the earth, 
ye dragons, and all deeps: 
 
8  fire, and hail; snow, and vapor; 
   
stormy wind fulfilling his word:
