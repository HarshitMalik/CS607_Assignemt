  1211    Psalms 10 
10 
A Prayer for the Overthrow of the Wicked 
1  Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? 
 
Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 
 
2  The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: 
 
let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 
3  For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, 
and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. 
4  The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, 
will not seek after God: 
 
God is not in all his thoughts. 
5  His ways are always grievous; 
 
thy judgments are far above out of his sight: 
 
as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 
6  He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: 
 
for I shall never be in adversity. 
7  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: 
 
under his tongue is mischief and vanity. 
8  He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: 
 
in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: 
 
his eyes are privily set against the poor. 
9  He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: 
 
he lieth in wait to catch the poor: 
 
he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 
10  He croucheth, and humbleth himself, 
that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 
11  He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: 
 
he hideth his face; he will never see it. 
 
12  Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: 
   
forget not the humble. 
13  Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? 
 
He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. 
14  Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite,
