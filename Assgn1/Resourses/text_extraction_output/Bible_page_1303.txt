  1304    Psalms 78 
and our fathers have told us. 
4  We will not hide them from their children, 
showing to the generation to come 
the praises of the Lord, and his strength, 
and his wonderful works that he hath done. 
5  For he established a testimony in Jacob, 
and appointed a law in Israel, 
which he commanded our fathers, 
that they should make them known to their children: 
 
6  that the generation to come might know them, 
even the children which should be born; 
 
who should arise and declare them to their children: 
 
7  that they might set their hope in God, 
and not forget the works of God, 
but keep his commandments: 
 
8  and might not be as their fathers, 
a stubborn and rebellious generation; 
 
a generation that set not their heart aright, 
and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. 
9  The children of Ephraim, 
being armed, and carrying bows, 
turned back in the day of battle. 
10  They kept not the covenant of God, 
and refused to walk in his law; 
 
11  and forgat his works, 
and his wonders that he had showed them. 
12  Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, 
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
13  He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; 
 
and he made the waters to stand as a heap.  
14  In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, 
and all the night with a light of fire.  
15  He clave the rocks in the wilderness, 
and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
16  He brought streams also out of the rock,
