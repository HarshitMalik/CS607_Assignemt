  2490    Ephesians 2 
2 
Saved by Grace 
1  And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; 
 
2  wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that 
now worketh in the children of disobedience: 
 
3  among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the 
lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; 
 
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 
4  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he 
loved us, 
5  even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with 
Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 
 
6  and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly 
places in Christ Jesus: 
 
7  that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his 
grace, in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus. 
8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: 
   
it is the gift of God: 
 
9  not of works, lest any man should boast. 
10  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good 
works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in 
them. 
One New Man in Christ 
11  Â¶ Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the 
flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the 
Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 
 
12  that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the 
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of 
promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
