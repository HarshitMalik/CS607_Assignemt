  876    2 Kings 17 
7  Â¶ For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the 
Lord their God, which had brought them up out of the land of 
Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had 
feared other gods, 
8  and walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out 
from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which 
they had made. 
9  And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not 
right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places 
in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced 
city. 
10  And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and 
under every green tree:  
 
11  and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the 
heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought 
 
wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger: 
 
12  for they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, Ye 
shall not do this thing. 
13  Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the 
prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, 
and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the 
law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by 
my servants the prophets. 
14  Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, 
like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord 
their God. 
15  And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with 
their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; 
 
and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the 
heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord 
had charged them, that they should not do like them. 
16  And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and 
made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and 
worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
