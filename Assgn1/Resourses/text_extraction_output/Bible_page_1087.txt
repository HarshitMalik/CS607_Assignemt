of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the 
 
governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

for this people.

The Plots of the Adversaries 
1  Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the 
Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the 
wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time 
 
I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 
 
2  that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet 
together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they 
thought to do me mischief. 
3  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, 
so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I 
 
leave it, and come down to you? 
 
4  Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered 
 
them after the same manner. 
5  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth 
time with an open letter in his hand; 
 
6  wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and 
Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which 
 
cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, 
according to these words. 
7  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at 
Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be 
 
reported to the king according to these words. Come now 
therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
8  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as 
thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
