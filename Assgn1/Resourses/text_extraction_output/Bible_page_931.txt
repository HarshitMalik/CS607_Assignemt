  932    1 Chronicles 11 
22  ¶ Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, 
who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also 
   
he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 
23  And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; 
 
and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he 
 
went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the 
Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
24  These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name 
among the three mighties. 
25  Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the 
first three: and David set him over his guard.
