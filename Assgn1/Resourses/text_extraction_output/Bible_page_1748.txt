  1749    Lamentations 4 
4 
The Punishment of Zion Accomplished 
1  How is the gold become dim! 
 
How is the most fine gold changed! 
 
The stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every 
street. 
2  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, 
how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, 
the work of the hands of the potter! 
 
3  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, 
they give suck to their young ones: 
 
the daughter of my people is become cruel, 
like the ostriches in the wilderness. 
4  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth 
for thirst: 
 
the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
5  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: 
 
they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
6  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people 
is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,  
that was overthrown as in a moment, 
and no hands stayed on her. 
7  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, 
they were whiter than milk, 
they were more ruddy in body than rubies, 
their polishing was of sapphire: 
 
8  their visage is blacker than a coal; 
 
they are not known in the streets: 
 
their skin cleaveth to their bones; 
 
it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
9  They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain 
with hunger:
