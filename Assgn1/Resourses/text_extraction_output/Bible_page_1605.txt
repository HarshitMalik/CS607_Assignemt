  1606    Isaiah 65 
5  which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier 
 
than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the 
day. 
6  Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will 
 
recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 
7  your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the 
Lord, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and 
blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their 
 
former work into their bosom. 
8  ¶ Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and 
one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my 
   
servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all. 
9  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an 
inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my 
 
servants shall dwell there. 
10  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place 
for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. 
11  But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy 
mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the 
drink offering unto that number. 
12  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow 
down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; 
   
when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and 
 
did choose that wherein I delighted not. 
13  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, 
but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall 
 
be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be 
 
ashamed: 
 
14  behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for 
sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 
15  And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the 
 
Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: 
 
16  that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the 
God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the
