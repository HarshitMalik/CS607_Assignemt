  2531    1 Timothy 3 
4  one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in 
subjection with all gravity; 
 
5  (for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he 
take care of the church of God?) 
 
6  not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the 
condemnation of the devil. 
7  Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; 
 
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.  
Qualifications of Deacons 
8  ¶ Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not 
given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
 
9  holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
10  And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a 
 
deacon, being found blameless. 
11  Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in 
all things. 
12  Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children 
and their own houses well. 
13  For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to 
themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is 
in Christ Jesus. 
The Mystery of Our Religion 
14  ¶ These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: 
 
15  but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to 
behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the 
living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 
16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: 
 
God was manifest in the flesh, 
justified in the Spirit, 
seen of angels, 
preached unto the Gentiles,
