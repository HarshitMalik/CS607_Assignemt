  1579    Isaiah 48 
5  I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to 
 
pass I showed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done 
 
them; and my graven image, and my molten image, hath 
 
commanded them. 
6  ¶ Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have 
   
showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and 
thou didst not know them. 
7  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the 
 
day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, 
 
I knew them. 
8  Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time 
   
that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal 
 
very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. 
9  ¶ For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will 
I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. 
10  Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee 
 
in the furnace of affliction. 
11  For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how 
 
should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto 
 
another. 
12  ¶ Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the 
   
first, I also am the last.  
13  Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right 
hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand 
 
up together. 
14  ¶ All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath 
 
declared these things? The Lord hath loved him: he will do his 
   
pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. 
15  I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, 
   
and he shall make his way prosperous. 
16  Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret 
 
from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now 
   
the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
