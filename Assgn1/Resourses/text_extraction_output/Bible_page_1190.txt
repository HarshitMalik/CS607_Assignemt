  1191    Job 38 
12  and it is turned round about by his counsels: 
 
that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them 
upon the face of the world in the earth. 
13  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, 
or for his land, or for mercy. 
14  Hearken unto this, O Job: 
 
stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
15  Dost thou know when God disposed them, 
and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
 
16  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, 
the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
 
17  how thy garments are warm, 
when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? 
 
18  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, 
which is strong, and as a molten looking-glass? 
 
19  Teach us what we shall say unto him; 
 
for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. 
20  Shall it be told him that I speak? 
 
If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 
21  And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: 
 
but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
22  Fair weather cometh out of the north: 
 
with God is terrible majesty. 
23  Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: 
 
he is excellent in power, and in judgment, 
and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. 
 
24  Men do therefore fear him: 
 
he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
