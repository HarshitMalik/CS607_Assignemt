  590    Judges 14 
23  But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he 
would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our 
hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would 
as at this time have told us such things as these. 
24  And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the 
 
child grew, and the Lord blessed him. 
25  And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp 
of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. 
14 
Samson and the Woman of Timnath 
1  And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath 
of the daughters of the Philistines. 
2  And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I 
have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: 
 
now therefore get her for me to wife. 
3  Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a 
woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my 
people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised 
Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for 
   
she pleaseth me well. 
4  ¶ But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, 
that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time 
 
the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
5  ¶ Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to 
Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a 
 
young lion roared against him. 
6  And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent 
him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: 
 
but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 
7  And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased 
 
Samson well.
