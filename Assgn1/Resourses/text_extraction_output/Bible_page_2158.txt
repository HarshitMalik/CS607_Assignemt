  2159    Luke 3 
45  And when they found him not, they turned back again to 
Jerusalem, seeking him. 
46  And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the 
temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and 
asking them questions. 
47  And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and 
answers. 
48  And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said 
 
unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy 
 
father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 
49  And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not 
 
that I must be about my Father’s business? 
 
50  And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 
51  And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was 
subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her 
 
heart. 
52  ¶ And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God 
and man.

saying, 
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
