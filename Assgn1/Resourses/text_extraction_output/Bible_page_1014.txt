  1015    2 Chronicles 22 
15  and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy 
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. 
16  ¶ Moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the 
Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 
 
17  and they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all 
the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, 
and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, 
 
the youngest of his sons. 
18  ¶ And after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an 
incurable disease. 
19  And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two 
years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore 
 
diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning 
of his fathers. 
20  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he 
reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being 
desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in 
the sepulchres of the kings. 
22 
The Reign of Ahaziah of Judah 
1  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son 
king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians 
 
to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram 
king of Judah reigned. 
2  Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and 
he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was 
Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
3  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother 
 
was his counselor to do wickedly. 
4  Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of 
Ahab: for they were his counselors, after the death of his father, to 
 
his destruction.
