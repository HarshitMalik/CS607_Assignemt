David Numbers Israel and Judah 
1  And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he 
moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. 
2  For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with 
him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to 
Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the 
number of the people. 
3  And Joab said unto the king, Now the Lord thy God add unto the 
people, how many soever they be, a hundredfold, and that the eyes 
of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king 
 
delight in this thing?
