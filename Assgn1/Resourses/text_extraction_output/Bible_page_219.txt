  220    Exodus 38 
The Supervision of the Work 
21  ¶ This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of 
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of 
Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to 
Aaron the priest. 
22  And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
made all that the Lord commanded Moses. 
23  And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, 
an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, 
and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 
The Metal of the Sanctuary 
24  ¶ All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the 
holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine 
talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of 
the sanctuary. 
25  And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was 
a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore 
and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
 
26  a bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty 
years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three 
thousand and five hundred and fifty men.  
27  And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the 
sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets of the 
 
hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
28  And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he 
made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted 
them. 
29  And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand 
and four hundred shekels.
