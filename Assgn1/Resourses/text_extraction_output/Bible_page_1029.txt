will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the 
ruin of him, and of all Israel. 
24  And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and 
cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors 
of the house of the Lord, and he made him altars in every corner 
of Jerusalem. 
25  And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn 
incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of 
his fathers. 
26  Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, 
they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
27  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, 
even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of 
 
the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

The Reign of Hezekiah 
1  Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and 
he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s 
name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2  And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according 
to all that David his father had done. 
Hezekiah Restores the Temple Worship 
3  ¶ He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the 
doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them. 
4  And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them 
together into the east street, 
5  and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; sanctify now yourselves, 
 
and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry 
forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
