Superior  people  observe  things  in  terms  of  principle—
right  or  wrong,  good  or  bad,  they  deal  with  them
accordingly. This is called selflessness. Selflessness results
in  objectivity;  objectivity  results  in  clarity.  Clarity  results
in  dealing  with  events  accurately  and  comprehending  the
nature of things.
If  you  view  things  through  your  ego,  then  love  and
hatred arise uncontrollably and you cannot avoid indulging
feelings.  When  you  indulge  feelings,  then  you  are  being
subjective.  When  you  are  subjective,  you  are  ignorant.
When  you  are  ignorant,  you  are  mixed  up  and  confused;
you are only aware of yourself, not of principle.
When there is principle, there is energy; when energy is
manifest, principle is hidden. When there is energy, there
is form; when form is manifest, energy is hidden. Principle
is always balanced, whereas energy is partial; form is even
more  partial.  Balance  is  good  in  all  respects;  there  is
something  that  is  not  good  in  partiality.  If  you  want  to
convert  what  is  not  good  in  partiality  to  return  to  the
goodness  of  balance,  you  must  examine  yourself  closely
on  the  brink  of  action.  Expand  and  fulfill  what  emerges
from  the  balance  of  principle;  cut  off  and  eliminate  what
comes  from  the  partiality  of  form.  After  a  long  time,
principle will naturally remain, while desires will naturally
disappear.
The  principles  of  the  world  must  be  investigated,  yet
they  cannot  all  be  investigated  completely.  There  is  an
essential point, which is to discern confusion in one’s own
