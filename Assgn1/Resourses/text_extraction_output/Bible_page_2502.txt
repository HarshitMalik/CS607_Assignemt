11  and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to 
the glory of God the Father. 
Shining as Lights in the World 
12  ¶ Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my 
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your 
own salvation with fear and trembling: 
 
13  for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good 
pleasure. 
14  ¶ Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
 
15  that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without 
rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among 
whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
 
16  holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of 
 
Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. 
17  Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I 
joy, and rejoice with you all. 
18  For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 
Timothy and Epaphroditus 
19  ¶ But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, 
that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
20  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your 
state. 
21  For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s. 
22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he 
hath served with me in the gospel. 
23  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it 
will go with me. 
24  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 
25  ¶ Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my 
brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your 
messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
