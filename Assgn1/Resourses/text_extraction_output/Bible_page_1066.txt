Ezra and His Company Come to Jerusalem 
1  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, 
Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
2  the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
3  the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
4  the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
5  the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son 
of Aaron the chief priest: 
 
6  this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the 
 
law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given: and the 
 
king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the Lord 
his God upon him. 
7  ¶ And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the 
priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the 
Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the 
king. 
8  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the 
seventh year of the king. 
9  For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from 
Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to 
Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 
10  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to 
do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. 
11  ¶ Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave 
unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the 
commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel. 
12  Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of 
the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. 
13  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his 
priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own 
free will to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
