  971    1 Chronicles 29 
17  I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in 
uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have 
willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy 
 
people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. 
18  O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this 
for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy 
people, and prepare their heart unto thee: 
 
19  and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy 
commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all 
these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made 
provision. 
20  ¶ And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord your 
God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their 
fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the Lord, 
and the king. 
21  And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and offered burnt 
offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, even a 
thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with 
their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 
 
22  and did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great 
gladness. 
¶ And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, 
and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor, and 
Zadok to be priest. 
23  Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of 
David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
 
24  And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise 
of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
25  And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all 
Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been 
on any king before him in Israel.

26  ¶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
