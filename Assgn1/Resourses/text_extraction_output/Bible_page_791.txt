  792    1 Kings 10 
19  The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round 
behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, 
 
and two lions stood beside the stays. 
20  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon 
the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
 
21  And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the 
vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none 
 
were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
 
22  For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: 
 
once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and 
silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
23  ¶ So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and 
for wisdom. 
24  And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which 
God had put in his heart. 
25  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and 
vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and 
mules, a rate year by year. 
Solomon’s Trade in Horses and Chariots 
26  ¶ And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he 
 
had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand 
horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with 
the king at Jerusalem. 
27  And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars 
made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for 
abundance. 
28  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the 
 
king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
29  And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred 
shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all 
 
the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring 
them out by their means.
