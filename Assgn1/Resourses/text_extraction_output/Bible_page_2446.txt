  2447    1 Corinthians 14 
11  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I 
thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish 
 
things. 
12  For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face: now I 
 
know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
 
13  And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest 
 
of these is charity. 
14 
Speaking in Tongues 
1  Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may 
prophesy. 
2  For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, 
but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit 
   
he speaketh mysteries. 
3  But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and 
exhortation, and comfort. 
4  He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he 
 
that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
5  I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye 
prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh 
 
with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive 
edifying. 
6  Â¶ Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what 
shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or 
by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
 
7  And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, 
except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known 
what is piped or harped? 
 
8  For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare 
himself to the battle?
