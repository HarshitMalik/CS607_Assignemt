  464    Deuteronomy 24 
20  unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother 
 
thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless 
 
thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou 
goest to possess it. 
21  ¶ When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt 
not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of 
 
thee; and it would be sin in thee. 
 
22  But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 
23  That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even 
 
a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord 
thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth. 
24  ¶ When thou comest into thy neighbor’s vineyard, then thou 
mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not 
 
put any in thy vessel. 
25  When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbor, then 
thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not 
 
move a sickle unto thy neighbor’s standing corn. 
24 
1  When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to 
pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some 
uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, 
 
and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
2  And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be 
another man’s wife. 
3  And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of 
divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his 
house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; 
   
4  her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again 
to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination 
 
before the Lord: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which 
 
the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
