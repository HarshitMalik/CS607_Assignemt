  396    Numbers 33 
3  And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the 
fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover 
 
the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all 
the Egyptians. 
4  For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had 
smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed 
 
judgments. 
5  ¶ And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in 
Succoth. 
6  And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in 
the edge of the wilderness. 
7  And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-
hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before 
 
Migdol. 
8  And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through 
the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ 
journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 
9  And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim 
 
were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; 
 
and they pitched there. 
10  And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea. 
11  And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the 
wilderness of Sin. 
12  And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and 
encamped in Dophkah. 
13  And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. 
14  And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where 
was no water for the people to drink. 
15  And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness 
of Sinai. 
16  And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibroth-
hattaavah. 
17  And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at 
Hazeroth. 
18  And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.
