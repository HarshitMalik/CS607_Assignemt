  676    1 Samuel 24 
24  ¶ And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his 
 
men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of 
Jeshimon. 
25  Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: 
 
wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness 
of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the 
wilderness of Maon. 
26  And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his 
men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get 
 
away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and 
 
his men round about to take them. 
27  But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and 
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
 
28  Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went 
against the Philstines: therefore they called that place Sela-
 
hammahlekoth [the rock of divisions]. 
29  And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strongholds at 
Engedi. 
24 
David Spares Saul at Engedi 
1  And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the 
Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the 
wilderness of Engedi. 
2  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and 
went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 
3  And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and 
 
Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in 
 
the sides of the cave.  
4  And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the 
Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine 
hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. 
Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
