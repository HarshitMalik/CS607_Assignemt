A  sage  said,  “The  richness  of  inner  virtue  is  like  an
infant.”  Who  does  not  start  life  as  an  infant?  If  we  can
clear  away  the  stain  of  habits,  we  return  to  our  primal
innocence; the virtue of sages is simply thus.
Political,  familial,  and  social  relations  are  universal
expressions  of  the  Way;  those  who  talk  about  the  Way
without  these  are  outsiders.  Wisdom,  humanity,  and
courage  are  universal  expressions  of  virtue;  those  who
speak of virtue without these are immoral.
Confucius  said  to  rely  on  virtue.  Reliance  means
holding firmly so that it is attained once and for all, never
to be lost. Eventually it matures, and on maturing it turns
into humanity.
HUMANITY
Humanity  is  human;  a  human  who  is  not  humane  yet
wants  to  become  a  realized  human  being  can  in  no  way
succeed.  I  consider  what  Confucians  call  humanity  to  be
equivalent  to  what  Buddhists  call  relics  and  Immortalists
call the golden pill.
The  mind  is  the  house  of  humanity;  humanity  is  the
owner  of  the  mind.  Just  clean  your  mind  and  you  will
accordingly  sense  basic  energy  coming  back,  filling  your
whole body; you turn around and look upon all things as
one. This is a sign of self-realization. Therefore it is said,
“If  you  master  yourself  and  return  to  order  one  day,  the
whole world reverts to humanity.”
