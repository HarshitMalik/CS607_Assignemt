  2317    Acts 4 
26  The kings of the earth stood up, 
and the rulers were gathered together 
against the Lord, and against his Christ.  
27  For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast 
anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and 
the people of Israel, were gathered together, 
28  for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before 
to be done. 
29  And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy 
 
servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
30  by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders 
 
may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 
31  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were 
assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, 
 
and they spake the word of God with boldness. 
All Things in Common 
32  ¶ And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of 
one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he 
 
possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  
 
33  And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection 
of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
 
34  Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were 
 
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of 
the things that were sold, 
35  and laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made 
 
unto every man according as he had need.  
36  And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, 
being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the 
country of Cyprus, 
37  having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the 
apostles’ feet.
