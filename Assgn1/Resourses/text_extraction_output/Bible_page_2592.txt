The Second Epistle General of 
Peter 
[2 Peter] 
1 
Salutation 
1  Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, 
¶ To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through 
the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
 
2  ¶ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge 
of God, and of Jesus our Lord. 
Make Your Calling and Election Sure 
3  ¶ According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that 
pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that 
hath called us to glory and virtue: 
 
4  whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; 
 
that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having 
escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 
5  And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and 
 
to virtue, knowledge; 
 
6  and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and 
   
to patience, godliness; 
 
7  and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, 
 
charity. 
8  For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye 
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
9  But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, 
and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
10  Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling 
and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
