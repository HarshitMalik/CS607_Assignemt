As  long  as  you  sense  your  breathing  is  gentle  and  feel
empty,  clear,  and  exhilarated,  this  is  correct  practice  of

When  the  mind  rests  below  the  navel,  that  is  called
womb breathing. Mind and breath submerge together into
the  region  below  the  navel;  keeping  them  clear  and  pure
naturally is called “not forgetting,” while going along with

your  mind,  using  abstruse  silence  as  the  place  you  rest

breath  come  to  stay  together,  spirit  and  energy  merge
harmoniously. Before you realize it, positive energy arises
ecstatically, and you are as if intoxicated.
