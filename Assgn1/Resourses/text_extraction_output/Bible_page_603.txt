  604    Judges 20 
24  Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I 
 
will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what 
seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. 
 
25  But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his 
 
concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, 
 
and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day 
 
began to spring, they let her go. 
26  Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at 
the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light. 
27  ¶ And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the 
house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his 
 
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands 
were upon the threshold. 
28  And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. 
Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and 
gat him unto his place. 
29  And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid 
hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, 
into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel. 
30  And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done 
nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the 
land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak 
 
your minds.

The War against the Benjamites 
1  Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was 
gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with 
the land of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh. 
2  And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, 
presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four 
hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
