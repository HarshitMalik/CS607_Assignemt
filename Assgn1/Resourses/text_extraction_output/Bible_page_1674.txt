  1675    Jeremiah 29 
7  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be 
carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the 
 
peace thereof shall ye have peace. 
8  For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your 
 
prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, 
neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 
9  For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent 
 
them, saith the Lord. 
10  ¶ For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be 
accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good 
word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
11  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, 
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
12  Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I 
will hearken unto you. 
13  And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with 
all your heart.  
14  And I will be found of you, saith the Lord: and I will turn away 
 
your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from 
all the places whither I have driven you, saith the Lord; and I will 
 
bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried 
away captive. 
15  ¶ Because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in 
Babylon; 
 
16  know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the 
throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and 
of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 
 
17  thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the 
 
sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile 
figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
18  And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and 
with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the 
kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a 
hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have 
driven them:
