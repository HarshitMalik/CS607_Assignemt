  560    Judges 3 
11  And the land had rest forty years: and Othniel the son of Kenaz 
 
died. 
Ehud Delivers Israel from Moab 
12  ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: 
 
and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, 
because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord. 
13  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, 
and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. 
14  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen 
years. 
15  ¶ But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord 
raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a 
man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present 
 
unto Eglon the king of Moab. 
16  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit 
length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
 
17  And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon 
 
was a very fat man. 
18  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away 
the people that bare the present. 
19  But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, 
and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep 
 
silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
20  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, 
 
which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message 
from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. 
21  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his 
right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
 
22  and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon 
 
the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and 
 
the dirt came out. 
23  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the 
parlor upon him, and locked them.
