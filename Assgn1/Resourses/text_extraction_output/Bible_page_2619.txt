  2620    Revelation 3 
thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come 
upon thee.  
4  Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their 
garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are 
   
worthy. 
5  He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; 
 
and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will 
confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  
6  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches. 
The Message to Philadelphia 
7  ¶ And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These 
 
things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of 
David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no 
 
man openeth.  
8  ¶ I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, 
 
and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept 
 
my word, and hast not denied my name. 
9  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they 
are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come 
 
and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. 
10  Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep 
thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the 
world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. 
11  Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no 
 
man take thy crown. 
12  Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, 
and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of 
 
my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new 
Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I 
 
will write upon him my new name. 
13  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
churches.
