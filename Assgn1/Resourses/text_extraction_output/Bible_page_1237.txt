  1238    Psalms 32 
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications 
when I cried unto thee. 
23  O love the Lord, all ye his saints: 
 
for the Lord preserveth the faithful, 
and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. 
24  Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, 
all ye that hope in the Lord.

The Blessedness of Forgiveness 
A Psalm of David, Maschil. 
1  Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, 
whose sin is covered. 
2  Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,  
and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
3  When I kept silence, my bones waxed old 
through my roaring all the day long. 
4  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: 
 
my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. 
Selah. 
5  I acknowledged my sin unto thee, 
and mine iniquity have I not hid. 
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; 
 
and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.  
Selah. 
6  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee 
in a time when thou mayest be found: 
 
surely in the floods of great waters 
they shall not come nigh unto him. 
7  Thou art my hiding place; 
 
thou shalt preserve me from trouble; 
 
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.
