  1822    Ezekiel 31 
4  The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her 
rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers 
unto all the trees of the field. 
5  Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and 
his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because 
of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. 
6  All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under 
his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, 
and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
7  Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for 
 
his root was by great waters. 
8  The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees 
 
were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his 
branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in 
 
his beauty. 
9  I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches; so that all 
 
the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. 
10  Â¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast lifted up 
 
thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick 
boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
 
11  I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of 
the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out 
   
for his wickedness. 
12  And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and 
have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his 
 
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of 
the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his 
 
shadow, and have left him. 
13  Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the 
beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
 
14  to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves 
for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick 
boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink 
water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of
