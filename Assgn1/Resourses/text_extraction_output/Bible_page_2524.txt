  2525    2 Thessalonians 3 
9  even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power 
and signs and lying wonders,  
10  and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; 
 
because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be 
saved. 
11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they 
should believe a lie: 
 
12  that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had 
pleasure in unrighteousness. 
Chosen to Salvation 
13  ¶ But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren 
beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen 
you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of 
the truth: 
 
14  whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the 
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
15  Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye 
have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. 
16  ¶ Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, 
which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and 
good hope through grace, 
17  comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and 
work.

Pray for Us 
1  Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have 
free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: 
 
2  and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: 
 
for all men have not faith.
