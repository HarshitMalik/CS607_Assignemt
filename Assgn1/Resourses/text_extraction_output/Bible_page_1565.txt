  1566    Isaiah 42 
23  Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that 
ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and 
 
behold it together. 
24  Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an 
 
abomination is he that chooseth you. 
25  ¶ I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the 
 
rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come 
 
upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay. 
26  Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and 
 
beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that 
 
showeth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that 
heareth your words. 
27  The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to 
 
Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. 
28  For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there 
 
was no counselor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. 
29  Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten 
   
images are wind and confusion.

The Lord’s Servant 
1  Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul 
 
delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth 
   
judgment to the Gentiles. 
2  He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the 
street. 
3  A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not 
quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 
 
4  He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in 
the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.  
 
5  ¶ Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and 
stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which
