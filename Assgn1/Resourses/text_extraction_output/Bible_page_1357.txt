  1358    Psalms 116 
he will bless us; 
 
he will bless the house of Israel; 
 
he will bless the house of Aaron. 
13  He will bless them that fear the Lord, 
both small and great.  
14  The Lord shall increase you more and more, 
you and your children. 
15  Ye are blessed of the Lord 
which made heaven and earth. 
16  The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lordâ€™s: 
 
but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
17  The dead praise not the Lord, 
neither any that go down into silence. 
18  But we will bless the Lord 
from this time forth and for evermore. 
Praise the Lord.

Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death 
1  I love the Lord, because he hath heard 
my voice and my supplications. 
2  Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, 
therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 
3  The sorrows of death compassed me, 
and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: 
 
I found trouble and sorrow. 
4  Then called I upon the name of the Lord; 
 
O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
5  Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; 
 
yea, our God is merciful. 
6  The Lord preserveth the simple: 
 
I was brought low, and he helped me. 
7  Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
