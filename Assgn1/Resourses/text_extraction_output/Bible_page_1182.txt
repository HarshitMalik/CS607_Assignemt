  1183    Job 33 
I also am formed out of the clay. 
7  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, 
neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 
8  Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, 
and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 
9  I am clean without transgression, 
I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. 
 
10  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, 
he counteth me for his enemy; 
 
11  he putteth my feet in the stocks, 
he marketh all my paths. 
12  Behold, in this thou art not just: 
 
I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 
13  Why dost thou strive against him? 
 
for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 
14  For God speaketh once, 
yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. 
15  In a dream, in a vision of the night, 
when deep sleep falleth upon men, 
in slumberings upon the bed; 
 
16  then he openeth the ears of men, 
and sealeth their instruction, 
17  that he may withdraw man from his purpose, 
and hide pride from man. 
18  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, 
and his life from perishing by the sword. 
19  He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, 
and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: 
 
20  so that his life abhorreth bread, 
and his soul dainty meat. 
21  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; 
 
and his bones that were not seen stick out. 
22  Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, 
and his life to the destroyers. 
23  If there be a messenger with him,
