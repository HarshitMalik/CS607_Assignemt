  186    Exodus 26 
15  ¶ And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood 
standing up. 
16  Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall 
be the breadth of one board. 
17  Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against 
another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
 
18  And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards 
on the south side southward. 
19  And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty 
boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two 
 
sockets under another board for his two tenons. 
20  And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there 
shall be twenty boards, 
21  and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and 
 
two sockets under another board. 
22  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six 
boards. 
23  And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in 
the two sides. 
24  And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be 
coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be 
 
for them both; they shall be for the two corners. 
 
25  And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen 
sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under 
 
another board. 
26  ¶ And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of 
 
the one side of the tabernacle, 
27  and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and 
five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two 
sides westward. 
28  And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end 
to end. 
29  And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings 
of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with 
 
gold.
