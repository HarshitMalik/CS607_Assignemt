  1604    Isaiah 64 
14  As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused 
him to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious 
 
name. 
Prayer for Mercy and Help 
15  ¶ Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy 
holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the 
 
sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they 
 
restrained? 
 
16  Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, 
and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our Father, our 
 
Redeemer; thy name is from everlasting. 
 
17  O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and 
hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, 
 
the tribes of thine inheritance. 
18  The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our 
 
adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. 
19  We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called 
   
by thy name. 
64 
1  Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come 
down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 
2  as when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, 
to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may 
tremble at thy presence! 
 
3  When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou 
camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 
4  For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor 
perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides 
thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
