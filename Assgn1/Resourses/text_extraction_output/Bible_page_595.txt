  596    Judges 16 
17  that he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not 
come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God 
 
from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go 
 
from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man. 
18  ¶ And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent 
and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this 
once, for he hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the 
Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
19  And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, 
 
and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she 
 
began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
20  And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke 
out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and 
shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from 
him. 
21  But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him 
down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did 
 
grind in the prison house. 
22  Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was 
shaven. 
The Death of Samson 
23  ¶ Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to 
offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they 
 
said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
24  And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they 
 
said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the 
destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. 
25  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, 
Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for 
Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they 
   
set him between the pillars.
