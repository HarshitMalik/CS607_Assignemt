  2278    John 11 
44  And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with 
graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus 
 
saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 
The Plot against Jesus 
45  ¶ Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the 
things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
46  But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them 
what things Jesus had done. 
47  Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and 
said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 
 
48  If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the 
 
Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. 
49  And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same 
year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 
50  nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for 
the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
51  And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he 
 
prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
 
52  and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather 
together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
53  Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him 
to death. 
54  ¶ Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went 
 
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called 
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
55  ¶ And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of 
 
the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify 
themselves. 
56  Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they 
stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the 
feast?
