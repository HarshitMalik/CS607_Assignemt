The Marriage Supper of the Lamb 
9  ¶ And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called 
unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, 
These are the true sayings of God. 
10  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou 
do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the 
 
testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the 
   
spirit of prophecy. 
The Rider on the White Horse 
11  ¶ And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that 
 
sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he 
doth judge and make war. 
12  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; 
 
and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. 
13  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is 
 
called The Word of God. 
14  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white 
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 
15  And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should 
smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he 
   
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty 
God.  
16  And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King 
of Kings, and Lord of Lords. 
17  ¶ And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud 
 
voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come 
and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; 
 
18  that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the 
flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit
