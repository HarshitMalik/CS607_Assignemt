  1777    Ezekiel 14 
19  And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and 
for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save 
the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that 
hear your lies? 
 
20  Â¶ Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against your 
 
pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I 
will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the 
souls that ye hunt to make them fly. 
21  Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your 
hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye 
 
shall know that I am the Lord. 
22  Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, 
whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the 
 
wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by 
promising him life; 
 
23  therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I 
 
will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I 
 
am the Lord.

Judgment on Idolaters Who Consult a Prophet 
1  Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before 
me. 
2  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
3  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and 
put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I 
 
be inquired of at all by them? 
 
4  Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
God; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in 
 
his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his 
face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that 
 
cometh, according to the multitude of his idols;
