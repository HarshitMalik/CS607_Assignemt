  66    Genesis 28 
9  then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he 
had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of 
Nebajoth, to be his wife. 
God Appears to Jacob at Beth-el 
10  ¶ And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. 
11  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, 
because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and 
 
put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
12  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the 
top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending 
 
and descending on it.

thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not 
 
leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.

in this place; and I knew it not. 
 
17  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none 
 
other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
18  ¶ And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that 
he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil 
upon the top of it. 
19  And he called the name of that place Beth-el [the house of God]: 
 
but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 
20  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will 
keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and 
raiment to put on,
