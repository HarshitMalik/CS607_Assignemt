  1626    Jeremiah 7 
7 
Amend Your Ways and Your Doings 
1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 
2  Stand in the gate of the Lord’s house, and proclaim there this 
word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah, that 
enter in at these gates to worship the Lord. 
3  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways 
and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. 
4  Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The 
temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these. 
5  ¶ For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye 
 
thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor; 
 
6  if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and 
shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods 
to your hurt; 
 
7  then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to 
your fathers, for ever and ever. 
8  ¶ Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 
9  Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and 
burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know 
not; 
 
10  and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my 
name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? 
 
11  Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers 
in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord. 
 
12  But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my 
name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my 
people Israel. 
13  And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, 
and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard 
not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
