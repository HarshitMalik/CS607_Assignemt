great toe of his right foot. 
15  And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the 
palm of his own left hand: 
 
16  and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left 
hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times 
before the Lord: 
 
17  and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon 
the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the 
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, 
upon the blood of the trespass offering: 
 
18  and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall pour

before the Lord. 
24  And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the 
log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before 
the Lord: 
 
25  and he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest 
shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon
