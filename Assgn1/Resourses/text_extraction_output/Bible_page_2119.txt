  2120    Mark 8 
18  Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye 
   
not remember? 
 
19  When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many 
baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. 
 
20  And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full 
of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 
 
21  And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? 
 
A Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida 
22  ¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto 
 
him, and besought him to touch him. 
23  And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the 
town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon 
 
him, he asked him if he saw aught. 
24  And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 
25  After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look 
up; and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
 
26  And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the 
town, nor tell it to any in the town. 
Peter’s Confession 
27  ¶ And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea 
Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, 
 
Whom do men say that I am? 
 
28  And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and 
   
others, One of the prophets.  
29  And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter 
 
answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.  
30  And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
