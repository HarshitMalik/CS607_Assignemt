  111    Genesis 45 
10  and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near 
unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and 
thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 
 
11  and there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; 
   
lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to 
poverty.  
12  And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, 
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
13  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that 
ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 
 
14  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and 
 
Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
15  Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after 
 
that his brethren talked with him. 
16  ¶ And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, 
Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his 
 
servants. 
17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; 
 
lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 
 
18  and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and 
 
I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat 
of the land. 
19  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the 
 
land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring 
your father, and come. 
20  Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is 
 
yours. 
21  ¶ And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, 
 
according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them 
provision for the way. 
22  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to 
 
Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of 
raiment.
