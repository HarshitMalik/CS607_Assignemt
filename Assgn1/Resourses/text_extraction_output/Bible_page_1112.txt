  1113    Esther 1 
10  ¶ On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with 
wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and 
Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in 
the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 
11  to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to 
show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look 
 
on. 
12  But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment 
by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his 
 
anger burned in him. 
13  ¶ Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for 
so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 
 
14  and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, 
Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and 
Media, which saw the king’s face, and which sat the first in the 
kingdom,) 
15  What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because 
she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus 
by the chamberlains? 
 
16  And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti 
the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the 
princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the 
king Ahasuerus. 
17  For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so 
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be 
reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be 
brought in before him, but she came not. 
18  Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the 
king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus 
shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. 
19  If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, 
and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, 
that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king 
Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that 
 
is better than she.
