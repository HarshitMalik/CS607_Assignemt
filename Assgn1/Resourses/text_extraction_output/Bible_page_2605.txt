  2606    1 John 5 
2  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love 
God, and keep his commandments. 
3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and 
 
his commandments are not grievous. 
4  For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is 
 
the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 
5  Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that 
Jesus is the Son of God? 
 
The Witness concerning the Son 
6  ¶ This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by 
 
water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth 
witness, because the Spirit is truth. 
7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the 
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 
 
8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the 
water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 
 
9  If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for 
 
this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 
10  He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he 
 
that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth 
 
not the record that God gave of his Son. 
11  And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and 
this life is in his Son.  
12  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God 
 
hath not life. 
The Knowledge of Eternal Life 
13  ¶ These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of 
the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that 
 
ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 
14  And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any 
thing according to his will, he heareth us:
