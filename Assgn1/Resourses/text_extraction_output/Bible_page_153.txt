  154    Exodus 13 
48  And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the 
passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let 
him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in 
 
the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 
 
49  One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger 
that sojourneth among you. 
50  ¶ Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
51  And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the 
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 
13 
The Consecration of the Firstborn 
1  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
2  Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb 
among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.  
 
3  ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye 
came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength 
 
of hand the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no 
 
leavened bread be eaten. 
4  This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
5  And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the 
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, 
and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a 
land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service 
in this month. 
6  Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day 
shall be a feast to the Lord. 
7  Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no 
 
leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen 
with thee in all thy quarters.
