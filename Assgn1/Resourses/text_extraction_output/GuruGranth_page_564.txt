Become the slave of the Lord‟s slaves, and you shall obtain the True Name.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   True is the tongue which is imbued with Truth, and true are the mind and 
body. By praising any other than the True Lord, one‟s whole life is wasted.  || 2 ||   Let 
Truth be the farm, Truth the seed, and Truth the merchandise you trade. Night and 
day, earn the profit of the True Name; you shall have treasures overflowing with the 
wealth of devotional worship.  || 3 ||   Let Truth be your food, and let Truth be your 
clothes; let your True Support be the Name of the Lord. One who is so blessed receives 
it, and obtains a seat in the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence.  || 4 ||   In Truth we come, 
and  in  Truth  we  go,  and  then  we  are  not  consigned  to  reincarnation  again.  The 
Gurmukhs are recognized as True in the True Court; they merge in the True Lord.  || 5 
||   Deep within they are True, and their minds are True; they sing the Glorious Praises 
of the True Lord. In the true place, they praise the True One; I am a sacrifice to the 
True Guru.  || 6 ||   True is the time, and true is the moment, when one falls in love 
with the True Lord. Then, he sees Truth, and speaks the Truth; he realizes the True 
Lord throughout the entire Creation.  || 7 ||   O Nanak, one merges with the True Lord, 
when He merges with Himself. As it pleases Him, He preserves us; He Himself ordains 
His  Will.    ||  8  ||  1  ||      WADAHANS,    THIRD  MEHL:    The  mind  wanders  in  the  ten 
directions — how can one sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord? It is totally engrossed 
in  sensuality,  constantly  tormented  by  sexual  desire  and  anger.    ||  1  ||      Waaho! 
Waaho! Hail! Hail! Chant His Glorious Praise. The Lord‟s Name is so difficult to obtain in 
this  age;  under  Guru‟s  Instruction,  drink  in  the  subtle  essence  of  the  Lord.    ||  1  ||  
Pause  ||   Remembering the Word of the Shabad, the mind becomes immaculate, and 
then one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Under Guru‟s Instruction, one comes to 
understand his own self, and then he comes to dwell in the home of his heart.  || 2 ||   
O my mind, be imbued forever with the Lord‟s Love, and sing the Glorious Praises of 
the Lord forever. The Immaculate Lord is forever the Giver of peace; from Him, one 
receives the fruits of the mind‟s desires.  || 3 ||   I am lowly, but I have been exalted, 
entering  the  Sanctuary  of  the  Lord.  He  has  lifted  up  the  sinking  stone;  True  is  His 
glorious  greatness.    ||  4  ||      From  poison,  I  have  been  transformed  into  Ambrosial 
Nectar; under Guru‟s Instruction, I have obtained wisdom. From bitter herbs, I have 
been transformed into sandalwood; this fragrance permeates deep within my being.  || 
5 ||   This human birth is very precious; one must earn the right to come into the world. 
By perfect destiny, I met the True Guru; I meditate on the Name of the Lord.  || 6 ||   
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; attached to corruption, they waste away their 
lives in vain. The Name of the Lord is forever an ocean of peace, but the manmukhs do 
not love the True Word of the Shabad.  || 7 ||   Everyone can chant the Name of the 
Lord,  Har,  Har  with  their  mouths,  but  only  a  few  enshrine  it  within  their  hearts.  O 
Nanak,  those  who  enshrine  the  Lord  within  their  hearts,  attain  liberation  and 
emancipation.  || 8 || 2 ||    
WADAHANS,  FIRST MEHL,  CHHANT:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
Why bother to wash the body which is polluted by falsehood? One‟s cleansing bath is 
only approved, if one practices Truth.
