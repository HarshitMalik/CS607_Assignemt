  225    Exodus 40 
9  And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, 
and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels 
thereof: and it shall be holy. 
 
10  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his 
vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 
 
11  And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 
12  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
13  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, 
and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s 
 
office. 
14  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
 
15  and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that 
they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing 
 
shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their 
generations. 
16  ¶ Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, 
 
so did he. 
17  And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the 
first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 
18  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and 
set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up 
his pillars. 
19  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the 
covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded 
 
Moses. 
20  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves 
on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
 
21  and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of 
the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses. 
22  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side 
of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. 
23  And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord; as the Lord 
 
had commanded Moses.
