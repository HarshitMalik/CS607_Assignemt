  478    Deuteronomy 29 
65  And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the 
sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a 
 
trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 
 
66  and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day 
 
and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 
 
67  in the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even 
 
thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine 
 
heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes 
which thou shalt see. 
68  And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the 
way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: 
 
and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and 
bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

The Lord’s Covenant with Israel in Moab 
1  These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded 
Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, 
besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. 
2  ¶ And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have 
seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt 
unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 
 
3  the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and 
those great miracles: 
 
4  yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to 
see, and ears to hear, unto this day. 
5  And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are 
 
not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy 
foot. 
6  Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong 
drink: that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.
