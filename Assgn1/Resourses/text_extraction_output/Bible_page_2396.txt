  2397    Romans 4 
31  Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we 
   
establish the law.

The Example of Abraham 
1  What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to 
the flesh, hath found? 
 
2  For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; 
 
but not before God. 
3  For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was 
 
counted unto him for righteousness.  
4  Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but 
of debt. 
5  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth 
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
6  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto 
whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 
7  saying, 
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are 
covered. 
8  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  
9  ¶ Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon 
the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to 
 
Abraham for righteousness. 
10  How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in 
 
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
 
11  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness 
of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be 
 
the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; 
 
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
 
12  and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the 
circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of 
our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
