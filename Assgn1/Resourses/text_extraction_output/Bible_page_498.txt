  499    Joshua 3 
3 
Israel Passes over the Jordan 
1  And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from 
 
Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and 
lodged there before they passed over. 
2  And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through 
the host; 
 
3  and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of 
the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites 
bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. 
4  Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand 
cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the 
 
way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way 
 
heretofore. 
5  And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow 
 
the Lord will do wonders among you. 
6  And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the 
covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the 
ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 
7  Â¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify 
thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was 
with Moses, so I will be with thee. 
8  And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the 
covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of 
Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. 
9  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear 
the words of the Lord your God. 
10  And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is 
among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you 
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the 
Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 
11  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth 
over before you into Jordan.
