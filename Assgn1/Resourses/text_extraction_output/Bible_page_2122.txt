  2123    Mark 9 
18  and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth, 
 
and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy 
 
disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. 
 
19  He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long 
shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto 
   
me. 
20  And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, 
 
straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and 
 
wallowed foaming. 
21  And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto 
him? And he said, Of a child. 
 
22  And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to 
destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, 
 
and help us. 
23  Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to 
him that believeth. 
24  And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with 
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
 
25  When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked 
the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge 
thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 
26  And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he 
 
was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. 
 
27  But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. 
 
28  And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him 
privately, Why could not we cast him out? 
 
29  And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but 
by prayer and fasting.

would not that any man should know it.
