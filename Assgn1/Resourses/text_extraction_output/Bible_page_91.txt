  92    Genesis 38 
4  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name 
 
Onan. 
5  And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name 
 
Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
 
6  And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 
7  And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and 
 
the Lord slew him. 
8  And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and 
marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
9  And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to 
 
pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on 
the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 
10  And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he 
 
slew him also. 
11  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at 
thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest 
 
peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and 
dwelt in her father’s house. 
12  ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; 
 
and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to 
Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
13  And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up 
to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
14  And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her 
with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is 
by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she 
 
was not given unto him to wife. 
15  When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had 
 
covered her face. 
16  And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let 
me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-
 
in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest 
 
come in unto me? 
 
17  And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt 
thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
