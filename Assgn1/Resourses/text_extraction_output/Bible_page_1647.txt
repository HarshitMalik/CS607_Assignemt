inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable 
things. 
19  ¶ O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day 
of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the 
earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, 
and things wherein there is no profit. 
20  Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 
 
21  ¶ Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will 
cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know 
 
that my name is The Lord.

Judah’s Heart Engraved with Sin 
1  The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of 
a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the 
 
horns of your altars; 
 
2  whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the 
green trees upon the high hills. 
3  O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy 
treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy 
borders. 
4  And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I 
gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land 
 
which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, 
 
which shall burn for ever. 
5  ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, 
 
and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the 
Lord. 
6  For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when 
good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the 
 
wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited. 
7  ¶ Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the 
Lord is.
