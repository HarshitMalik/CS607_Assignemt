  859    2 Kings 10 
Jehu Wipes Out the Worship of Baal 
18  ¶ And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, 
Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much. 
 
19  Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his 
servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great 
   
sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. 
 
But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the 
worshippers of Baal. 
20  And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they 
proclaimed it. 
21  And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal 
 
came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they 
came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from 
 
one end to another. 
22  And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth 
vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them 
forth vestments. 
23  And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of 
Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that 
there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord, but the 
worshippers of Baal only. 
24  And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu 
appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men 
whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, 
his life shall be for the life of him. 
25  ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the 
burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go 
in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with 
 
the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, 
 
and went to the city of the house of Baal. 
26  And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and 
burned them. 
27  And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house 
of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.
