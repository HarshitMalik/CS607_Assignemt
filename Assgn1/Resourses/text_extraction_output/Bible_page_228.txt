  229    Leviticus 2 
11  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the 
Lord: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round 
 
about upon the altar. 
12  And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the 
 
priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which 
is upon the altar: 
 
13  but he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the 
 
priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt 
 
sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
14  ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, 
then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. 
15  And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, 
and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at 
 
the side of the altar: 
 
16  and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside 
the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes. 
17  And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it 
asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood 
 
that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, 
 
of a sweet savor unto the Lord.

Meal Offerings 
1  And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his 
offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put 
 
frankincense thereon. 
2  And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take 
 
thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, 
with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the 
 
memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savor unto the Lord: 
 
3  and the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: 
 
it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.
