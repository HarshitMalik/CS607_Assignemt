  321    Numbers 7 
7  Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, 
according to their service: 
 
8  and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, 
according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of 
Aaron the priest. 
9  But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of 
 
the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon 
their shoulders. 
10  And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it 
was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the 
altar. 
11  And the Lord said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, 
each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar. 
12  ¶ And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the 
son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah: 
 
13  and his offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was a 
hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after 
the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were full of fine flour 
 
mingled with oil for a meat offering: 
 
14  one spoon of ten shekels of gold, full of incense: 
 
15  one young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt 
offering: 
 
16  one kid of the goats for a sin offering: 
 
17  and for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he 
goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Nahshon 
 
the son of Amminadab. 
18  ¶ On the second day Nethaneel the son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, 
did offer: 
 
19  he offered for his offering one silver charger, the weight whereof 
was a hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, 
after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour 
 
mingled with oil for a meat offering: 
 
20  one spoon of gold of ten shekels, full of incense: 
 
21  one young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt 
offering:
