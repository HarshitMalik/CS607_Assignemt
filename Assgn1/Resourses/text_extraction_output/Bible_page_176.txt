  177    Exodus 23 
22  Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.  
23  If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will 
surely hear their cry; 
 
24  and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and 
 
your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. 
25  ¶ If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou 
shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him 
usury.  
26  If thou at all take thy neighbor’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt 
deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 
 
27  for that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein 
 
shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, 
 
that I will hear; for I am gracious.  
 
28  ¶ Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.  
29  ¶ Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy 
liquors. 
¶ The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. 
30  Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven 
 
days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it 
 
me. 
31  ¶ And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh 
 
that is torn of beasts in the fields; ye shall cast it to the dogs. 
 
23 
1  Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the 
 
wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
2  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou 
 
speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 
 
3  neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.  
4  ¶ If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt 
surely bring it back to him again. 
5  If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, 
and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.  
6  ¶ Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
