  2338    Acts 11 
6  upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and 
saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping 
things, and fowls of the air. 
7  And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 
 
8  But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at 
 
any time entered into my mouth. 
9  But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath 
cleansed, that call not thou common. 
10  And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into 
 
heaven. 
11  And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto 
the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. 
12  And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover 
these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the manâ€™s 
house: 
 
13  and he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which 
stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, 
whose surname is Peter; 
 
14  who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be 
saved. 
15  And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at 
the beginning. 
16  Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John 
indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy 
 
Ghost.  
17  Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, 
who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I could 
withstand God? 
 
18  When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified 
God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted 
repentance unto life.
