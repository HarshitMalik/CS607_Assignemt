extent  that  nature  is  fulfilled,  to  that  extend  spirit  and
energy  are  congealed.  There  is  no  more  to  learning  than
serenely attaining this.”
The whole work is in stopping thought. The most direct
and  rapid  method  for  this  is  keeping  mind  and  breathing
together. How so? Energy is the mother of spirit, spirit is
the  child  of  energy;  mind  and  breathing  keeping  together
is like child and mother meeting. When spirit and energy
merge into one, after a long period of close intimacy this
produces great stabilization. This is called returning to the
root and restoring life. When the root is deep, the stem is
solid; this is the way of long life and eternal vision.
Ancestral  Teacher  Qiu  said,  “If  the  breathing  is  at  all
unsettled, life is not your own.” I say, “If the mind is at all
unforgotten,  breathing  cannot  be  settled.”  Human  beings
have  a  universal  nature  as  well  as  a  disposition.  The
universal nature is the totality of the absolute; as soon as it
gets  into  yin  and  yang  and  the  five  elements,  then  it  is
disposition.  So  the  substance  of  the  absolute  falls  into
disposition—it is not that there is a separate nature.
Master Zhang said, “When you skillfully return to it, the
universal  nature  is  there.”  Asked  if  there  is  a  way  of
skillful return, he said, “Yes. Confucians speak of cleaning
the  mind  and  being  inaccessible;  Buddhists  speak  of
independent  observation;  Taoists  speak  of  returning  to
simplicity. These are the beginnings of skillful return.
“Confucians  say  that  there  is  stability  after  knowing
when to stop and there can be serenity after stabilization.
