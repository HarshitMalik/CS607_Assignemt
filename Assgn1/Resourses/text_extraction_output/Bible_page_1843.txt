  1844    Ezekiel 40 
therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of 
their enemies; so fell they all by the sword. 
 
24  According to their uncleanness and according to their 
transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them. 
25  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Now will I bring again the 
 
captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, 
and will be jealous for my holy name; 
 
26  after that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses 
whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in 
their land, and none made them afraid. 
27  When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered 
them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the 
sight of many nations; 
 
28  then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, which caused 
them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have 
 
gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any 
more there. 
29  Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured 
 
out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.

The Prophet’s Vision of the Temple 
1  In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of 
the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after 
that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord 
was upon me, and brought me thither. 
2  In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set 
me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city 
on the south.  
3  And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose 
appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in 
his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
