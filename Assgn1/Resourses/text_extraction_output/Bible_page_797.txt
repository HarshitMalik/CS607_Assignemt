  798    1 Kings 12 
Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of 
Nebat. 
16  ¶ So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, 
the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in 
David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your 
   
tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel 
 
departed unto their tents. 
17  But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, 
Rehoboam reigned over them. 
18  Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and 
 
all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king 
Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to 
Jerusalem. 
19  So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
20  And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come 
again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and 
made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the 
 
house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 
21  ¶ And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all 
the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and 
fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight 
against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to 
Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
22  But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
23  Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and 
unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of 
the people, saying, 
24  Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your 
brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for 
   
this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the 
Lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord.
