12  and let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare 
unto Judah, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this 
young woman. 
13  ¶ So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in 
 
unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son. 
14  And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which hath 
not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be 
famous in Israel. 
15  And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of 
thine old age: for thy daughter-in-law, which loveth thee, which is 
 
better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him. 
16  And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became 
nurse unto it. 
17  And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a 
son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father 
   
of Jesse, the father of David. 
18  ¶ Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, 
 
19  and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 
20  and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 
21  and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 
22  and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
