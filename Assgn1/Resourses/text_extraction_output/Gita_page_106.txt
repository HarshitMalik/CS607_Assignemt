BHAGAVAD GITA
24. On seeing Thee (the Cosmic Form) touching the sky, shining in many colours, with
mouths wide open, with large, fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart and find neither courage nor peace,
O Vishnu!
Damshtraakaraalaani cha te mukhaani
Drishtwaiva kaalaanalasannibhaani;
Disho na jaane na labhe cha sharma
Praseeda devesha jagannivaasa.
25. Having seen Thy mouths, fearful with teeth, blazing like the fires of cosmic dissolution,
I know not the four quarters, nor do I find peace. Have mercy, O Lord of the gods! O abode of the
universe!
Amee cha twaam dhritaraashtrasya putraah
Sarve sahaivaavanipaalasanghaih;
Bheeshmo dronah sootaputrastathaa’sau
Sahaasmadeeyairapi yodhamukhyaih.
26. All the sons of Dhritarashtra with the hosts of kings of the earth, Bhishma, Drona and
Karna, with the chief among all our warriors,
Vaktraani te twaramaanaa vishanti
Damshtraakaraalaani bhayaanakaani;
Kechidwilagnaa dashanaantareshu
Sandrishyante choornitairuttamaangaih.
27. They hurriedly enter into Thy mouths with terrible teeth and fearful to behold. Some are
found sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed to powder.
Yathaa nadeenaam bahavo’mbuvegaah
Samudramevaabhimukhaah dravanti;
Tathaa tavaamee naralokaveeraah
Vishanti vaktraanyabhivijwalanti.
28. Verily, just as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, even so these heroes of the
world of men enter Thy flaming mouths.
COMMENTARY: Arjuna sees all the warriors, whom he did not wish to kill, rushing to
death. He knows now that the Lord has already destroyed them, so why should he worry about the
inevitable.
Yathaa pradeeptam jwalanam patangaa
Vishanti naashaaya samriddhavegaah;
Tathaiva naashaaya vishanti lokaas
Tavaapi vaktraani samriddhavegaah.
