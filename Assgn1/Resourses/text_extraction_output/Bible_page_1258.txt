  1259    Psalms 46 
for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. 
 
12  And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; 
 
even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 
13  The King’s daughter is all glorious within: 
 
her clothing is of wrought gold. 
14  She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: 
 
the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto 
thee. 
15  With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: 
 
they shall enter into the King’s palace. 
16  Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, 
whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 
17  I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: 
 
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

God Is Our Refuge and Strength 
To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah,  
A Song upon Alamoth. 
1  God is our refuge and strength, 
a very present help in trouble. 
2  Therefore will not we fear, 
though the earth be removed, 
and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
 
3  though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, 
though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. 
Selah. 
4  There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, 
the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 
5  God is in the midst of her; 
 
she shall not be moved: 
 
God shall help her, and that right early.
