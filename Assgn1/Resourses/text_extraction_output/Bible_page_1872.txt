  1873    Daniel 2 
11  And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none 
other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose 
dwelling is not with flesh. 
12  ¶ For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and 
commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
13  And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and 
 
they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. 
14  Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the 
captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise 
men of Babylon: 
 
15  he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the 
decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known 
 
to Daniel. 
16  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give 
him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation. 
17  ¶ Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to 
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
 
18  that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning 
this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the 
 
rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
19  Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then 
Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
20  Daniel answered and said, 
Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: 
 
for wisdom and might are his: 
 
21  and he changeth the times and the seasons: 
 
he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: 
 
he giveth wisdom unto the wise, 
and knowledge to them that know understanding: 
 
22  he revealeth the deep and secret things: 
 
he knoweth what is in the darkness, 
and the light dwelleth with him. 
23  I thank thee, and praise thee, 
O thou God of my fathers, 
who hast given me wisdom and might,
