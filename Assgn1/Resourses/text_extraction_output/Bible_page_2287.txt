  2288    John 15 
30  Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this 
 
world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
31  But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the 
 
Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. 
15 
Jesus the True Vine 
1  I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
2  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and 
 
every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring 
forth more fruit. 
3  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 
4  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, 
except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
 
5  I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in 
him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do 
 
nothing. 
6  If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is 
withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and 
 
they are burned. 
7  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye 
will, and it shall be done unto you. 
8  Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be 
 
my disciples. 
9  As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my 
 
love. 
10  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I 
 
have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. 
11  These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in 
you, and that your joy might be full. 
12  ¶ This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have 
loved you.
