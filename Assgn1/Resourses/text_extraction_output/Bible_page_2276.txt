  2277    John 11 
30  Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place 
where Martha met him. 
31  The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted 
her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, 
followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 
32  Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell 
down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, 
my brother had not died. 
33  When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping 
which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
34  and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come 
 
and see. 
35  Jesus wept. 
36  Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
 
37  And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes 
of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 
 
Lazarus Brought to Life 
38  Â¶ Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It 
was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
39  Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that 
was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he 
 
hath been dead four days. 
40  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest 
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 
 
41  Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was 
laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that 
thou hast heard me. 
42  And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people 
 
which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent 
me. 
43  And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, 
come forth.
