  954    1 Chronicles 22 
22 
1  Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the 
altar of the burnt offering for Israel. 
David’s Preparation for the Temple 
2  ¶ And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were 
in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to 
 
build the house of God. 
3  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of 
the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without 
 
weight; 
 
4  also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre 
 
brought much cedar wood to David. 
5  And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the 
house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding 
magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will 
 
therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared 
abundantly before his death. 
6  ¶ Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a 
house for the Lord God of Israel. 
7  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind 
to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God: 
 
8  but the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed 
blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a 
 
house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the 
earth in my sight. 
9  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and 
 
I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name 
 
shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in 
his days. 
10  He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I 
 
will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom 
 
over Israel for ever.
