it;  so  it  is  called  the  pivot  of  the  sky.  Since  even  the
heavens  have  a  pivot—which  is  considered  the  root  of
creation—human  beings  also  have  a  pivot,  which  is
considered the source of nature and life.
Even though they are equally human, there are so-called
great  people  who  match  their  qualities  with  heaven  and
earth. Try examining your own mind and your own nature
—how  may  they  match  heaven  and  earth?  If  they  match,
then be diligent; if not, then quickly reform. Do this, and
attaining human greatness will not be a worry.
Heaven produces, earth develops; they are our universal
father and mother. Heaven is active, earth is still; they are
our  universal  guide  and  teacher.  The  past  sages  were  the
children  of  heaven  and  earth;  the  future  sages  are  kindly
descendants of heaven and earth. Those who actually love
their  parents  are  great  in  virtue;  they  will  surely  receive
life. Those who actually respect their teachers learn from
the ground up and arrive at the peak.
HUMAN LIFE
Human  life  is  the  ultimate;  when  the  ultimate  goes  into
action  it  produces  positive  energy  as  fire.  Fire  is  spirit.
When the ultimate becomes quiescent it produces negative
energy as water. Water is vitality. The fire of spirit and the
water of vitality combine subtly and congeal between the
two kidneys to constitute the root of original energy.
