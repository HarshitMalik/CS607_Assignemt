  339    Numbers 13 
6  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
7  Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
8  Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 
9  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
10  Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
11  Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the 
son of Susi. 
12  Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
13  Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
14  Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
15  Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
16  These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the 
land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua. 
17  ¶ And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said 
unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the 
mountain: 
 
18  and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, 
 
whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 
 
19  and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; 
 
and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in 
strongholds; 
 
20  and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be 
wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the 
fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes. 
21  ¶ So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of 
Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 
22  And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where 
 
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now 
Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
23  And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from 
thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between 
two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the 
 
figs.
