  1540    Isaiah 29 
23  ¶ Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. 
 
24  Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break 
 
the clods of his ground? 
 
25  When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad 
the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat 
and the appointed barley and the rye in their place? 
 
26  For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him. 
27  ¶ For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, 
neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the 
 
fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. 
28  Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor 
 
break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. 
29  This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful 
in counsel, and excellent in working.

Ariel and Her Enemies 
1  Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to 
 
year; let them kill sacrifices. 
 
2  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: 
 
and it shall be unto me as Ariel. 
3  And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against 
thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. 
4  And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, 
and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, 
as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy 
speech shall whisper out of the dust. 
5  ¶ Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, 
and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth 
away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. 
 
6  Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with 
earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the 
flame of devouring fire.
