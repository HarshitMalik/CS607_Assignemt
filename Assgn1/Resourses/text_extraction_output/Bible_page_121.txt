  122    Genesis 50 
The Death and Burial of Jacob 
28  ¶ All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their 
 
father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to 
 
his blessing he blessed them. 
29  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered 
unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the 
 
field of Ephron the Hittite, 
30  in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before 
Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the 
field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.  
31  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried 
 
Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
 
32  The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from 
the children of Heth. 
33  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he 
gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was 
gathered unto his people.

1  And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and 
kissed him. 
2  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his 
father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
 
3  And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of 
 
those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him 
 
threescore and ten days. 
4  ¶ And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto 
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your 
eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
5  My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I 
 
have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury 
me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, 
and I will come again.
