  1510    Isaiah 10 
The Lord’s Use of Assyria 
5  ¶ O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is 
mine indignation. 
6  I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people 
of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take 
the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
7  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it 
 
is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. 
8  For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 
 
9  Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not 
   
Samaria as Damascus? 
 
10  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose 
graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
 
11  shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to 
Jerusalem and her idols? 
 
12  ¶ Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath 
performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I 
will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and 
the glory of his high looks. 
13  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my 
wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the 
   
people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the 
inhabitants like a valiant man: 
 
14  and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as 
 
one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and 
 
there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or 
peeped. 
15  ¶ Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or 
 
shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod 
 
should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff 
should lift up itself, as if it were no wood. 
16  Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones 
leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the 
 
burning of a fire.
