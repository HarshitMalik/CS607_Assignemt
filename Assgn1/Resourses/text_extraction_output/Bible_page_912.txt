  913    1 Chronicles 5 
34  ¶ And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah, 
35  and Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of 
Asiel, 
36  and Elioenai and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and Adiel, 
and Jesimiel, and Benaiah, 
37  and Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the 
son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah; 
 
38  these mentioned by their names were princes in their families: and 
 
the house of their fathers increased greatly. 
39  And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east side of 
the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 
40  And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and 
quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old. 
 
41  And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of 
Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found 
there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their 
rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks. 
 
42  And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, 
went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and 
Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 
43  And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and 
dwelt there unto this day.

The Descendants of Reuben 
1  Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the 
firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his 
 
birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and 
 
the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. 
2  For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief 
ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s:) 
   
3  the sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and 
Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
