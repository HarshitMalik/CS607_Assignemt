  1173    Job 28 
and a place for gold where they fine it. 
2  Iron is taken out of the earth, 
and brass is molten out of the stone. 
3  He setteth an end to darkness, 
and searcheth out all perfection: 
 
the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
4  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; 
 
even the waters forgotten of the foot: 
 
they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
5  As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: 
 
and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
6  The stones of it are the place of sapphires: 
 
and it hath dust of gold. 
7  There is a path which no fowl knoweth, 
and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen: 
 
8  the lion’s whelps have not trodden it, 
nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
9  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; 
 
he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
10  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; 
 
and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
11  He bindeth the floods from overflowing; 
 
and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
12  But where shall wisdom be found? 
 
And where is the place of understanding? 
 
13  Man knoweth not the price thereof; 
 
neither is it found in the land of the living. 
14  The depth saith, It is not in me: 
 
and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
15  It cannot be gotten for gold, 
neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 
16  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, 
with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
17  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: 
 
and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
