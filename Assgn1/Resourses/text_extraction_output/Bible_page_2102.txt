  2103    Mark 3 
A Multitude at the Seaside 
7  ¶ But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a 
 
great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, 
8  and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; 
 
and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had 
heard what great things he did, came unto him. 
9  And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him 
because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
10  For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for 
 
to touch him, as many as had plagues.  
11  And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and 
cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
12  And he straitly charged them that they should not make him 
known. 
Jesus Chooses the Twelve 
13  ¶ And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he 
would: and they came unto him. 
 
14  And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he 
might send them forth to preach, 
15  and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 
 
16  and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
 
17  and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and 
 
he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 
 
18  And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and 
Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon 
the Canaanite, 
19  and Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him. 
¶ And they went into a house.
