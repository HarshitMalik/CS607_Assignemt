  85    Genesis 35 
12  and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, 
and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.  
13  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
14  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even 
a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he 
 
poured oil thereon. 
15  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, 
Beth-el.  
The Death of Rachel 
16  ¶ And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way 
 
to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. 
 
17  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife 
said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
 
18  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died,) 
that she called his name Benoni [the son of my sorrow]: but his 
 
father called him Benjamin [the son of the right hand]. 
19  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is 
Bethlehem. 
20  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel’s 
 
grave unto this day. 
21  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 
The Sons of Jacob 
22  ¶ And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben 
went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard it. 
 
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
 
23  the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, 
 
and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 
 
24  the sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
   
25  and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 
   
26  and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These are 
 
the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
