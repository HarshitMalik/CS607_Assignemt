  2265    John 8 
47  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 
 
48  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
 
49  But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
50  Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being 
one of them,) 
51  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he 
doeth? 
 
52  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, 
 
and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 
 
The Woman Caught in Adultery 
53  Â¶ And every man went unto his own house. 
8 
1  Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
2  And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all 
the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
 
3  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in 
adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
 
4  they say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in 
the very act. 
5  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: 
 
but what sayest thou? 
 
6  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. 
But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, 
as though he heard them not. 
7  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said 
unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a 
stone at her. 
8  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
9  And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, 
went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: 
 
and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
