  2605    1 John 5 
9  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God 
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live 
through him. 
10  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and 
sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 
11  Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 
12  No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God 
dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 
13  Â¶ Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he 
hath given us of his Spirit. 
14  And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be 
the Saviour of the world. 
15  Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth 
in him, and he in God. 
16  And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God 
is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in 
 
him. 
17  Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the 
day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 
 
18  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because 
   
fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
19  We love him, because he first loved us. 
20  If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he 
 
that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love 
God whom he hath not seen? 
 
21  And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth 
God love his brother also.

Faith Is the Victory over the World 
1  Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and 
 
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is 
begotten of him.
