  1562    Isaiah 40 
with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, 
   
Behold your God! 
 
10  Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm 
shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work 
 
before him.  
11  He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs 
 
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead 
those that are with young. 
Israel’s Incomparable God 
12  ¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and 
meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the 
earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the 
hills in a balance? 
 
13  Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counselor 
hath taught him?  
 
14  With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught 
him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and 
showed to him the way of understanding? 
 
15  Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the 
small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very 
 
little thing. 
16  And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof 
sufficient for a burnt offering. 
17  All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him 
 
less than nothing, and vanity. 
18  ¶ To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye 
 
compare unto him? 
 
19  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith 
spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. 
20  He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree 
that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to 
 
prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
