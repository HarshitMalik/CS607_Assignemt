children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to 
 
the evil. 
36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
Judging Others 
37  ¶ Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall 
 
not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
   
38  give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, 
 
and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your 
bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be 
measured to you again. 
39  ¶ And he spake a parable unto them; Can the blind lead the blind? 
   
shall they not both fall into the ditch?  
 
40  The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect 
 
shall be as his master. 
41  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but 
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
 
42  Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out 
the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the 
beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the 
 
beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull 
out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye. 
A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit 
43  ¶ For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a 
 
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 
44  For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not 
gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
45  A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that 
which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart 
 
bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart 
 
his mouth speaketh.
