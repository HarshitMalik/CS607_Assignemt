  1839    Ezekiel 38 
23  neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor 
with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: 
 
but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they 
have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and 
 
I will be their God. 
24  ¶ And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall 
 
have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and 
 
observe my statutes, and do them. 
25  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my 
servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell 
 
therein, even they, and their children, and their children’s children 
for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever. 
 
26  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an 
 
everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and 
 
multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for 
evermore. 
27  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and 
 
they shall be my people.  
28  And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, 
when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

The Prophecy against Gog 
1  And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief 
prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 
3  and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O 
 
Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
 
4  and I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will 
bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of 
them clothed with all sorts of armor, even a great company with 
bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
