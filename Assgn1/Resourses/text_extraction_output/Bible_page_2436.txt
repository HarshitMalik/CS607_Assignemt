  2437    1 Corinthians 9 
5  For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in 
earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
6  but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, 
and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, 
 
and we by him. 
7  ¶ Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with 
 
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto 
an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 
 
8  But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we 
 
the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
 
9  But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a 
stumblingblock to them that are weak. 
10  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the 
idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be 
emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
 
11  and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for 
whom Christ died? 
 
12  But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak 
conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
13  Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh 
while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

The Rights of Those Who Preach the Gospel 
1  Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our 
   
Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
   
2  If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the 
 
seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
3  ¶ Mine answer to them that do examine me is this: 
 
4  Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
 
5  Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other 
apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
 
6  Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
