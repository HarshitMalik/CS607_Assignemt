and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: 
   
therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord. 
33  ¶ And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, 
saying, What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto 
 
them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the Lord. 
 
34  And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, 
The burden of the Lord, I will even punish that man and his 
house. 
35  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his 
brother, What hath the Lord answered? and, What hath the 
 
Lord spoken? 
 
36  And the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more; for every 
 
man’s word shall be his burden: for ye have perverted the words of 
 
the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God. 
37  Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord answered 
thee? and, What hath the Lord spoken? 
   
38  But since ye say, The burden of the Lord; therefore thus saith the 
 
Lord; Because ye say this word, The burden of the Lord, and I 
 
have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the 
Lord; 
 
39  therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will 
forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast 
you out of my presence: 
 
40  and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual 
shame, which shall not be forgotten.

The Lesson from the Good and Bad Figs 
1  The Lord showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set 
before the temple of the Lord, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of 
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim 
king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and 
smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
