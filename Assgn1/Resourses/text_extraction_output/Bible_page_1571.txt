  1572    Isaiah 44 
13  The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; 
   
he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, 
and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a 
man; that it may remain in the house. 
 
14  He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, 
which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: 
 
he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it. 
15  Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and 
 
warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he 
   
maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, 
 
and falleth down thereto. 
16  He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth 
 
flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, 
   
and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 
 
17  and the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he 
 
falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and 
saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. 
 
18  ¶ They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their 
 
eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot 
 
understand. 
19  And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor 
understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I 
 
have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and 
 
eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall 
   
I fall down to the stock of a tree? 
 
20  He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that 
 
he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right 
hand? 
 
The Lord the Redeemer of Israel 
21  ¶ Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I 
   
have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be 
   
forgotten of me.
