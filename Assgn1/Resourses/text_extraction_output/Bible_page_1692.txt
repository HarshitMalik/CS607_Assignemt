  1693    Jeremiah 35 
12  ¶ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, 
13  Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the 
 
men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive 
instruction to hearken to my words? saith the Lord. 
 
14  The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his 
sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink 
 
none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I 
 
have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened 
 
not unto me. 
15  I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up 
early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his 
evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to 
serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you 
and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor 
 
hearkened unto me. 
16  Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the 
commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but 
 
this people hath not hearkened unto me: 
 
17  therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel; 
 
Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because 
 
I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have 
 
called unto them, but they have not answered. 
18  ¶ And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith 
the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the 
 
commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, 
and done according unto all that he hath commanded you; 
 
19  therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab 
 
the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
