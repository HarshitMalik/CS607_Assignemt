  333    Numbers 10 
21  ¶ And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the 
 
other did set up the tabernacle against they came. 
22  And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set 
forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama 
 
the son of Ammihud. 
23  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was 
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
24  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was 
Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
25  ¶ And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, 
which was the rearward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and 
 
over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 
26  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel 
the son of Ocran. 
27  And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira 
the son of Enan. 
28  Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to 
their armies, when they set forward. 
29  ¶ And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, 
Moses’ father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which 
the Lord said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do 
 
thee good: for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel. 
 
30  And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own 
 
land, and to my kindred.  
31  And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest 
 
how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us 
instead of eyes. 
32  And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what 
goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. 
33  ¶ And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days’ 
journey: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before 
 
them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for 
them. 
34  And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went 
out of the camp.
