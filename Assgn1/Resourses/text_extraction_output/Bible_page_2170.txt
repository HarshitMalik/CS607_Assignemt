  2171    Luke 6 
11  And they were filled with madness; and communed one with 
 
another what they might do to Jesus. 
Jesus Chooses the Twelve 
12  ¶ And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a 
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. 
13  And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them 
 
he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
 
14  Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, 
James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
15  Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called 
Zelotes, 
16  and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was 
the traitor. 
Jesus Ministers to a Great Multitude 
17  ¶ And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the 
company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all 
Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, 
which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
 
18  and they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were 
 
healed. 
19  And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went 
 
virtue out of him, and healed them all. 
Blessings and Woes 
20  ¶ And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye 
poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. 
 
21  ¶ Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are 
 
ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
