  565    Judges 5 
11  They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of 
drawing water,

thou son of Abinoam. 
13  Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles 
among the people:

and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. 
15  And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; 
 
even Issachar, and also Barak: 
 
he was sent on foot into the valley. 
For the divisions of Reuben 
there were great thoughts of heart.

to hear the bleatings of the flocks? 
 
For the divisions of Reuben 
there were great searchings of heart. 
17  Gilead abode beyond Jordan: 
 
and why did Dan remain in ships? 
 
Asher continued on the seashore, 
and abode in his breaches. 
18  Zebulun and Naphtali were a people 
that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the 
field. 
19  The kings came and fought; 
 
then fought the kings of Canaan 
in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo;
