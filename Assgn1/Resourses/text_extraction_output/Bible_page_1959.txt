Israel’s Moral Corruption 
1  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, 
 
as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my 
   
soul desired the first ripe fruit. 
2  The good man is perished out of the earth; and there is none upright 
 
among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his 
   
brother with a net. 
3  That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, 
and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his 
 
mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. 
 
4  The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a 
 
thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; 
   
now shall be their perplexity. 
5  Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the 
 
doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
6  For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against 
her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a 
 
man’s enemies are the men of his own house.  
7  Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my 
 
salvation: my God will hear me. 
 
The Lord Brings Light and Deliverance 
8  ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; 
   
when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. 
9  I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned 
against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: 
 
he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his 
righteousness.
