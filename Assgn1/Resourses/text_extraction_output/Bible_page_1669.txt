  1670    Jeremiah 27 
prophesied against this city and against this land according to all 
the words of Jeremiah: 
 
21  and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the 
princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but 
 
when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
 
22  and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the 
son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. 
23  And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto 
Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his 
 
dead body into the graves of the common people. 
24  Â¶ Nevertheless, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with 
Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people 
to put him to death.

The Lesson from the Yoke-bars 
1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of 
Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 
2  Thus saith the Lord to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put 
 
them upon thy neck, 
3  and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and 
to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the 
king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to 
Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 
 
4  and command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord 
of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; 
   
5  I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the 
ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have 
given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. 
6  And now have I given all these lands into the hand of 
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of 
 
the field have I given him also to serve him.
