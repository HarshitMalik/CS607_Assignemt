  572    Judges 7 
9  ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, 
Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into 
 
thine hand. 
10  But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down 
to the host: 
 
11  and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands 
 
be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down 
with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that 
were in the host. 
12  And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the 
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and 
 
their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for 
multitude. 
13  And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a 
dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, 
lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and 
came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that 
the tent lay along. 
14  And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the 
sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand 
 
hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. 
15  ¶ And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and 
the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into 
the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into 
 
your hand the host of Midian. 
16  And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and 
he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and 
lamps within the pitchers. 
17  And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, 
 
when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so 
shall ye do. 
18  When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow 
ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The 
sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.
