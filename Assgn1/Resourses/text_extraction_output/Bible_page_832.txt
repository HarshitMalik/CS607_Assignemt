  833    2 Kings 1 
spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come 
down. 
10  And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of 
God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and 
thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed 
him and his fifty. 
11  ¶ Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. 
And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the 
king said, Come down quickly. 
12  And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let 
fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And 
the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and 
his fifty. 
13  ¶ And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And 
the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees 
before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, 
I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be 
precious in thy sight. 
14  Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two 
captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life 
 
now be precious in thy sight. 
15  And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be 
 
not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the 
king. 
16  And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou 
hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it 
not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? 
 
therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art 
gone up, but shalt surely die. 
17  ¶ So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had 
spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead, in the second year of 
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no 
 
son. 
18  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not 
written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
