BHAGAVAD GITA
14. Then, Arjuna, filled with wonder and with hair standing on end, bowed down his head to
the Lord and spoke with joined palms.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Pashyaami devaamstava deva dehe
Sarvaamstathaa bhootavisheshasanghaan;
Brahmaanameesham kamalaasanastha-
Mrisheemshcha sarvaanuragaamshcha divyaan.
Arjuna said:
15. I behold all the gods, O God, in Thy body, and hosts of various classes of beings;
Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents!
Anekabaahoodaravaktranetram
Pashyaami twaam sarvatoâ€™nantaroopam;
Naantam na madhyam na punastavaadim
Pashyaami vishweshwara vishwaroopa.
16. I see Thee of boundless form on every side, with many arms, stomachs, mouths and
eyes; neither the end nor the middle nor also the beginning do I see, O Lord of the universe, O
Cosmic Form!
Kireetinam gadinam chakrinam cha,
Tejoraashim sarvato deeptimantam;
Pashyaami twaam durnireekshyam samantaad
Deeptaanalaarkadyutimaprameyam.
17. I see Thee with the diadem, the club and the discus, a mass of radiance shining
everywhere, very hard to look at, blazing all round like burning fire and the sun, and immeasurable.
Twamaksharam paramam veditavyam
Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam;
Twamavyayah shaashwatadharmagoptaa
Sanaatanastwam purusho mato me.
18. Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, worthy of being known; Thou art the
great treasure-house of this universe; Thou art the imperishable protector of the eternal Dharma;
Thou art the ancient Person, I deem.
Anaadimadhyaantamanantaveeryam
Anantabaahum shashisooryanetram;
Pashyaami twaam deeptahutaashavaktram
Swatejasaa vishwamidam tapantam.
