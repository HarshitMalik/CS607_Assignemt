  1160    Job 19 
and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 
15  They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, 
count me for a stranger: 
 
I am an alien in their sight. 
16  I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; 
 
I entreated him with my mouth. 
17  My breath is strange to my wife, 
though I entreated for the childrenâ€™s sake of mine own body. 
18  Yea, young children despised me; 
 
I arose, and they spake against me. 
19  All my inward friends abhorred me: 
 
and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
20  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, 
and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
21  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; 
 
for the hand of God hath touched me. 
22  Why do ye persecute me as God, 
and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
 
23  Oh that my words were now written! 
 
Oh that they were printed in a book! 
 
24  That they were graven with an iron pen and lead 
in the rock for ever! 
 
25  For I know that my Redeemer liveth, 
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 
 
26  and though after my skin worms destroy this body, 
yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
 
27  whom I shall see for myself, 
and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; 
 
though my reins be consumed within me. 
28  But ye should say, Why persecute we him, 
seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 
 
29  Be ye afraid of the sword: 
 
for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, 
that ye may know there is a judgment.
