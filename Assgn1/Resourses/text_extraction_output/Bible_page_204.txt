  205    Exodus 33 
unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, 
saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 
 
2  and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the 
 
Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the 
Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
 
3  unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the 
 
midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee 
   
in the way. 
4  ¶ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and 
 
no man did put on him his ornaments. 
5  For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, 
Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in 
 
a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments 
 
from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 
6  And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments 
by the mount Horeb. 
7  ¶ And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, 
afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the 
congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the 
Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was 
without the camp. 
8  And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that 
all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and 
looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
9  And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the 
cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, 
and the Lord talked with Moses. 
10  And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle 
door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his 
 
tent door. 
11  And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh 
unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant 
 
Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the 
tabernacle.
