  2146    Mark 15 
20  And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from 
him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify 
him. 
The Crucifixion 
21  ¶ And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming 
out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his 
cross. 
22  And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being 
interpreted, The place of a skull. 
23  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he 
 
received it not. 
24  And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, 
casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
25  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
26  And the superscription of his accusation was written over, The 
king of the jews. 
27  And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, 
 
and the other on his left. 
28  And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered 
with the transgressors.  
29  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and 
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three 
days,  
30  save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
31  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with 
the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 
 
32  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we 
may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled 
him. 
33  ¶ And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the 
whole land until the ninth hour.
