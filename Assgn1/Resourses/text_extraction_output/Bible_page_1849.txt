  1850    Ezekiel 41 
11  And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was 
left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the 
south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits 
 
round about. 
12  ¶ Now the building that was before the separate place at the end 
toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the 
 
building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof 
ninety cubits. 
13  ¶ So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the 
 
separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred 
cubits long; 
 
14  also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place 
toward the east, a hundred cubits. 
15  ¶ And he measured the length of the building over against the 
separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the 
one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner 
temple, and the porches of the court; 
 
16  the doorposts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round 
about on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood 
round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the 
windows were covered; 
 
17  to that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, 
and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. 
18  And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree 
was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; 
   
19  so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, 
and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: 
 
it was made through all the house round about. 
20  From the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm 
trees made, and on the wall of the temple. 
21  ¶ The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the 
sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other. 
 
22  The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two 
cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the
