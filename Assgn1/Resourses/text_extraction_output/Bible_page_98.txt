  99    Genesis 41 
16  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall 
 
give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon 
the bank of the river: 
 
18  and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed 
and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow: 
   
19  and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very 
ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of 
Egypt for badness: 
 
20  and the lean and the ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat 
kine: 
 
21  and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they 
had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. 
 
So I awoke. 
22  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one 
stalk, full and good: 
 
23  and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east 
wind, sprung up after them: 
 
24  and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto 
 
the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 
 
25  Â¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God 
 
hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
26  The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are 
 
seven years: the dream is one. 
 
27  And the seven thin and ill-favored kine that came up after them are 
seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind 
 
shall be seven years of famine. 
28  This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is 
 
about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh. 
29  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the 
land of Egypt: 
 
30  and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the 
 
plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall 
 
consume the land;
