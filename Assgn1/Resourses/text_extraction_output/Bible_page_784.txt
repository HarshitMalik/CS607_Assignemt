  785    1 Kings 8 
39  then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, 
and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou 
knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the 
 
children of men;) 
 
40  that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which 
thou gavest unto our fathers. 
41  ¶ Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, 
but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake; 
 
42  (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and 
of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this 
 
house: 
 
43  hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that 
the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may 
 
know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they 
 
may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy 
name. 
44  ¶ If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever 
thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city 
which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for 
thy name: 
 
45  then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and 
maintain their cause. 
46  ¶ If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and 
thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that 
they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or 
near; 
 
47  yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were 
carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in 
the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have 
sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 
 
48  and so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, 
in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray 
unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, 
the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built 
for thy name:
