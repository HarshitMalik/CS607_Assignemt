The Golden Candlestick 
31  Â¶ And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work 
 
shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his 
 
bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same. 
32  And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of 
 
the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the 
candlestick out of the other side: 
 
33  three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in 
one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other 
 
branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come 
 
out of the candlestick. 
34  And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, 
with their knops and their flowers. 
35  And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a 
knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two 
branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed 
out of the candlestick. 
36  Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all of it shall be 
 
one beaten work of pure gold. 
37  And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light 
 
the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. 
38  And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure 
gold. 
39  Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. 
40  And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was 
showed thee in the mount.

1  Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine 
twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of 
 
cunning work shalt thou make them.
