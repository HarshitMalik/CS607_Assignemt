  1673    Jeremiah 28 
Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of 
 
Babylon. 
5  ¶ Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in 
the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that 
stood in the house of the Lord, 
6  even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the Lord do so: the Lord 
   
perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the 
vessels of the Lord’s house, and all that is carried away captive, 
from Babylon into this place. 
7  Nevertheless, hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, 
and in the ears of all the people; 
 
8  The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old 
prophesied both against many countries, and against great 
kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
9  The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the 
prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that 
the Lord hath truly sent him. 
10  ¶ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet 
Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it. 
11  And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus 
saith the Lord; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar 
 
king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of 
two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
12  ¶ Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after 
that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck 
of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
13  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast 
 
broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of 
 
iron. 
14  For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a 
 
yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I 
   
have given him the beasts of the field also.
