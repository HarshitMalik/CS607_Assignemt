  2393    Romans 2 
2  But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth 
against them which commit such things. 
3  And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such 
things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of 
God? 
 
4  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and 
long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee 
 
to repentance? 
 
5  but, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto 
thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the 
righteous judgment of God; 
 
6  who will render to every man according to his deeds:  
 
7  to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory 
and honor and immortality, eternal life: 
 
8  but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but 
obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 
9  tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil; of 
 
the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
 
10  but glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good; to 
 
the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 
 
11  for there is no respect of persons with God.  
12  Â¶ For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without 
law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the 
 
law; 
 
13  (for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of 
the law shall be justified. 
14  For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the 
things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law 
unto themselves: 
 
15  which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their 
conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while 
accusing or else excusing one another;) 
 
16  in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ 
according to my gospel.
