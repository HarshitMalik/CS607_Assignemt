  2167    Luke 5 
3  And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and 
prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he 
sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.  
4  Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out 
into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
5  And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the 
night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let 
 
down the net. 
6  And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of 
fishes: and their net brake. 
 
7  And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other 
ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and 
filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. 
8  When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, 
Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
 
9  For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of 
the fishes which they had taken: 
 
10  and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were 
partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from 
 
henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
11  And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, 
and followed him. 
Jesus Cleanses a Leper 
12  ¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man 
full of leprosy; who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, 
 
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
13  And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou 
 
clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
14  And he charged him to tell no man: But go, and show thyself to the 
 
priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, 
for a testimony unto them.
