  360    Numbers 20 
not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy 
borders. 
18  And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come 
out against thee with the sword. 
19  And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high 
way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: 
   
I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet. 
20  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out 
against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 
21  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: 
 
wherefore Israel turned away from him. 
Aaron Dies on Mount Hor 
22  Â¶ And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, 
journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 
23  And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the 
coast of the land of Edom, saying, 
24  Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into 
 
the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye 
rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. 
25  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount 
Hor: 
 
26  and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his 
son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. 
 
27  And Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up into 
 
mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
28  And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon 
Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and 
   
Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 
29  And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they 
mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
