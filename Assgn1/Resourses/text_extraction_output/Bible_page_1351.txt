  1352    Psalms 109 
and let the strangers spoil his labor. 
12  Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: 
 
neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children. 
13  Let his posterity be cut off; 
 
and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 
14  Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; 
 
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
15  Let them be before the Lord continually, 
that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
16  Because that he remembered not to show mercy, 
but persecuted the poor and needy man, 
that he might even slay the broken in heart. 
17  As he loved cursing, 
so let it come unto him: 
 
as he delighted not in blessing, 
so let it be far from him. 
18  As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, 
so let it come into his bowels like water, 
and like oil into his bones. 
19  Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, 
and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 
20  Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, 
and of them that speak evil against my soul. 
21  But do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake: 
 
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. 
22  For I am poor and needy, 
and my heart is wounded within me. 
23  I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: 
 
I am tossed up and down as the locust. 
24  My knees are weak through fasting; 
 
and my flesh faileth of fatness. 
25  I became also a reproach unto them: 
 
when they looked upon me they shook their heads.  
26  Help me, O Lord my God: 
 
O save me according to thy mercy:
