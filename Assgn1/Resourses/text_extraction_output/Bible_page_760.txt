  761    1 Kings 1 
34  and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there 
king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save 
 
king Solomon. 
35  Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon 
my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed 
   
him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
36  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, 
Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too. 
 
37  As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with 
Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord 
king David. 
38  ¶ So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the 
son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went 
down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and 
brought him to Gihon. 
39  And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and 
anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people 
 
said, God save king Solomon. 
40  And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with 
pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the 
sound of them. 
41  ¶ And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as 
they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of 
the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an 
uproar? 
 
42  And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the 
priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a 
   
valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 
43  And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king 
David hath made Solomon king. 
44  And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the 
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and 
the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s 
mule:
