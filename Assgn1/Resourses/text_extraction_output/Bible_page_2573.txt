  2574    Hebrews 13 
Benediction and Final Greetings 
20  ¶ Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord 
Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the 
everlasting covenant, 
21  make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you 
that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to 
 
whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
22  ¶ And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I 
 
have written a letter unto you in few words. 
23  Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if 
 
he come shortly, I will see you. 
24  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They 
of Italy salute you. 
25  Grace be with you all. Amen.
