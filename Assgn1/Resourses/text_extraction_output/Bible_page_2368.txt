  2369    Acts 21 
27  ¶ And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which 
were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the 
people, and laid hands on him, 
28  crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all 
 
men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: 
 
and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted 
this holy place. 
29  (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an 
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the 
temple.) 
30  And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they 
 
took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the 
 
doors were shut. 
31  And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief 
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar: 
 
32  who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto 
them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they 
 
left beating of Paul. 
33  Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded 
him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and 
 
what he had done. 
34  And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: 
 
and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he 
commanded him to be carried into the castle. 
35  And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of 
the soldiers for the violence of the people. 
36  For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with 
him. 
Paul’s Defense before the People 
37  ¶ And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief 
captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak 
 
Greek?
