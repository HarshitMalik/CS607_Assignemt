  2035    Matthew 10 
The Mission of the Twelve 
5  ¶ These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go 
not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the 
Samaritans enter ye not: 
 
6  but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
7  And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
8  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: 
 
freely ye have received, freely give. 
9  Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses; 
 
10  nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet 
staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  
 
11  And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is 
worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 
 
12  And when ye come into a house, salute it. 
13  And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be 
 
not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
14  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when 
ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  
15  Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of 
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.  
Coming Persecutions 
16  ¶ Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye 
 
therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 
17  But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and 
 
they will scourge you in their synagogues; 
 
18  and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for 
a testimony against them and the Gentiles. 
19  But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye 
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall 
 
speak. 
20  For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which 
speaketh in you.
