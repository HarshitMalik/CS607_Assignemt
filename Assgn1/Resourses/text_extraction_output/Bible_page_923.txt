  924    1 Chronicles 8 
6  And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of 
 
the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath: 
 
7  and Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat 
Uzza, and Ahihud. 
8  And Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab, after he had 
sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives. 
 
9  And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and 
Malcham, 
10  and Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These were his sons, heads of 
the fathers. 
11  And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal. 
12  The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built 
 
Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof: 
 
13  Beriah also, and Shema, who were heads of the fathers of the 
inhabitants of Ajalon, who drove away the inhabitants of Gath: 
 
14  and Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth, 
15  and Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader, 
16  and Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah; 
 
17  and Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki, and Heber, 
18  Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal; 
 
19  and Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi, 
20  and Elienai, and Zilthai, and Eliel, 
21  and Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimhi; 
 
22  and Ishpan, and Heber, and Eliel, 
23  and Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan, 
24  and Hananiah, and Elam, and Antothijah,
