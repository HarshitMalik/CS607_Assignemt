The Unity of the Spirit 
1  I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk 
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 
2  with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing 
one another in love;  
 
3  endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
4  There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope 
of your calling; 
 
5  one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
6  one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in 
you all. 
7  But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of 
the gift of Christ. 
8  Wherefore he saith, 
When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, 
and gave gifts unto men.  
9  (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first 
into the lower parts of the earth? 
 
10  He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all 
heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
11  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, 
   
evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 
   
12  for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the 
edifying of the body of Christ: 
 
13  till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of 
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature 
of the fulness of Christ:
