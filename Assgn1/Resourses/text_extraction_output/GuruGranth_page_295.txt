The most sublime wisdom and purifying baths; the four cardinal blessings, the opening 
of the heart-lotus; in the midst of all, and yet detached from all; beauty, intelligence, 
and the realization of reality; to look impartially upon all, and to see only the One — 
these  blessings  come  to  one  who,  through  Guru  Nanak,  chants  the  Naam  with  his 
mouth, and hears the Word with his ears.  || 6 ||   One who chants this treasure in his 
mind  —  in  every  age, he attains salvation. In it is the Glory of God, the Naam, the 
chanting  of  Gurbani.  The  Simritees,  the  Shaastras  and  the  Vedas  speak  of  it.  The 
essence of all religion is the Lord‟s Name alone. It abides in the minds of the devotees 
of God. Millions of sins are erased, in the Company of the Holy. By the Grace of the 
Saint, one escapes the Messenger of Death. Those, who have such pre-ordained destiny 
on their foreheads, O Nanak, enter the Sanctuary of the Saints.  || 7 ||   One, within 
whose mind it abides, and who listens to it with love — that humble person consciously 
remembers the Lord God. The pains of birth and death are removed. The human body, 
so  difficult  to  obtain,  is  instantly  redeemed.  Spotlessly  pure  is  his  reputation,  and 
ambrosial is his speech. The One Name permeates his mind. Sorrow, sickness, fear and 
doubt depart. He is called a Holy person; his actions are immaculate and pure. His glory 
becomes  the  highest  of  all.  O  Nanak,  by  these  Glorious  Virtues,  this  is  named 
Sukhmani, Peace of mind.  || 8 || 24 ||    
 
T‟HITEE ~ THE LUNAR DAYS:  GAUREE,  FIFTH MEHL,  SHALOK:   
O U C G B G T G
NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
The Creator Lord and Master is pervading the water, the land, and the sky. In so many 
ways, the One, the Universal Creator has diffused Himself, O Nanak.  || 1 ||   PAUREE:  
The first day of the lunar cycle:  Bow in humility and meditate on the One, the Universal 
Creator Lord God. Praise God, the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the World; 
seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, our King. Place your hopes in Him, for salvation and 
peace; all things come from Him. I wandered around the four corners of the world and 
in  the  ten  directions,  but  I  saw  nothing  except  Him.  I  listened  to  the  Vedas,  the 
Puraanas and the Simritees, and I pondered over them in so many ways. The Saving 
Grace of sinners, the Destroyer of fear, the Ocean of peace, the Formless Lord. The 
Great Giver, the Enjoyer, the Bestower — there is no place at all without Him. You shall 
obtain all that you desire, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.  || 1 ||   
Sing the Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, each and every day. Join the 
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and vibrate, meditate on Him, O my friend.  || 
1 ||  Pause  ||   SHALOK:  Bow in humility to the Lord, over and over again, and enter 
the Sanctuary of the Lord, our King. Doubt is eradicated, O Nanak, in the Company of 
the Holy, and the love of duality is eliminated.  || 2 ||   PAUREE:  The second day of the 
lunar cycle:  Get rid of your evil-mindedness, and serve the Guru continually. The jewel 
of the Lord‟s Name shall come to dwell in your mind and body, when you renounce 
sexual desire, anger and greed, O my friend. Conquer death and obtain eternal life; all 
your troubles will depart.
