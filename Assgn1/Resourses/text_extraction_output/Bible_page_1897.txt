  1898    Daniel 11 
12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that 
 
thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself 
before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy 
words. 
13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and 
twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help 
 
me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
 
14  Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy 
people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. 
 
15  ¶ And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face 
toward the ground, and I became dumb. 
16  And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my 
lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that 
 
stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned 
upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
17  For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for 
 
as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is 
there breath left in me. 
18  ¶ Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of 
a man, and he strengthened me, 
19  and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee; be 
   
strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was 
strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast 
 
strengthened me. 
20  Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now 
 
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone 
 
forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. 
21  But I will show thee that which is noted in the Scripture of truth: 
 
and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael 
your prince.

1  Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm 
and to strengthen him.
