  417    Deuteronomy 4 
10  specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in 
Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people 
together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn 
to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that 
they may teach their children. 
11  And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the 
 
mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with 
darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. 
12  And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard 
 
the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. 
 
13  And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you 
to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two 
 
tables of stone.  
14  And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes 
and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go 
over to possess it. 
Warning against Idolatry 
15  Â¶ Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no 
 
manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in 
Horeb out of the midst of the fire; 
 
16  lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the 
similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
17  the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any 
winged fowl that flieth in the air, 
18  the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness 
of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: 
 
19  and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest 
the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, 
shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the 
Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole 
heaven.
