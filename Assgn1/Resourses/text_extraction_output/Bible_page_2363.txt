  2364    Acts 20 
4  And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Beroea; and of the 
 
Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and 
 
Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
 
5  These going before tarried for us at Troas. 
6  And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened 
bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode 
 
seven days. 
Paul’s Farewell Visit at Troas 
7  ¶ And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came 
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart 
on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 
 
8  And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were 
gathered together. 
9  And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, 
being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he 
 
sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was 
taken up dead. 
10  And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, 
Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. 
 
11  When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and 
eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he 
departed. 
12  And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little 
comforted. 
The Voyage from Troas to Miletus 
13  ¶ And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there 
intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself 
 
to go afoot. 
14  And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to 
Mitylene.
