  1538    Isaiah 28 
28 
Condemnation of Ephraim 
1  Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose 
glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat 
valleys of them that are overcome with wine! 
 
2  Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest 
of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters 
overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. 
3  The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden 
under feet: 
 
4  and the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall 
be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which 
 
when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he 
eateth it up. 
5  ¶ In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and 
for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 
6  and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for 
strength to them that turn the battle to the gate. 
7  ¶ But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink 
are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through 
 
strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the 
way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in 
 
judgment. 
8  For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place 
clean. 
9  ¶ Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to 
 
understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and 
 
drawn from the breasts. 
10  For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon 
 
line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little. 
 
11  ¶ For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to 
this people.
