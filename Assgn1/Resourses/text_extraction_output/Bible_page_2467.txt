  2468    2 Corinthians 9 
15  as it is written, 
He that had gathered much had nothing over; 
 
and he that had gathered little had no lack.  
16  Â¶ But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the 
heart of Titus for you. 
17  For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of 
 
his own accord he went unto you. 
18  And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the 
gospel throughout all the churches; 
 
19  and not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel 
with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of 
the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: 
 
20  avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance 
which is administered by us: 
 
21  providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but 
also in the sight of men.  
22  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have 
oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more 
diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. 
23  Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper 
concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the 
 
messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. 
24  Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of 
your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

1  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for 
me to write to you: 
 
2  for I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you 
to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your 
 
zeal hath provoked very many. 
3  Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in 
vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
