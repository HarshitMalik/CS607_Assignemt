  548    Joshua 23 
23 
Joshuaâ€™s Charge to the People 
1  And it came to pass, a long time after that the Lord had given rest 
unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed 
old and stricken in age. 
2  And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their 
heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto 
them, I am old and stricken in age: 
 
3  and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all 
these nations because of you; for the Lord your God is he that hath 
 
fought for you. 
4  Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, 
to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the 
nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. 
5  And the Lord your God, he shall expel them from before you, and 
drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, 
 
as the Lord your God hath promised unto you. 
6  Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written 
in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to 
the right hand or to the left; 
 
7  that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among 
you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to 
 
swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 
 
8  but cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day. 
9  For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and 
strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you 
 
unto this day. 
10  One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he 
 
it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.  
11  Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord 
your God.
