25 
Bildad Denies That Man Can Be Justified with God 
1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
2  Dominion and fear are with him; 
 
he maketh peace in his high places. 
3  Is there any number of his armies? 
 
And upon whom doth not his light arise? 
 
4  How then can man be justified with God? 
 
Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 
5  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; 
 
yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
6  How much less man, that is a worm? 
 
and the son of man, which is a worm?

Job Declares Godâ€™s Sovereignty 
1  But Job answered and said, 
2  How hast thou helped him that is without power? 
 
How savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
 
3  How hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom? 
 
And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
 
4  To whom hast thou uttered words? 
 
And whose spirit came from thee? 
 
5  Dead things are formed from under the waters, 
and the inhabitants thereof. 
6  Hell is naked before him, 
and destruction hath no covering. 
7  He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, 
and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
8  He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; 
 
and the cloud is not rent under them.
