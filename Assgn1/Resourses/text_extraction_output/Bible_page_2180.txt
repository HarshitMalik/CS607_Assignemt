  2181    Luke 8 
29  (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. 
For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with 
 
chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the 
 
devil into the wilderness.) 
30  And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, 
 
Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
 
31  And they besought him that he would not command them to go 
out into the deep. 
32  And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the 
mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to 
 
enter into them. And he suffered them. 
33  Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: 
 
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and 
were choked. 
34  ¶ When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went 
and told it in the city and in the country. 
35  Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and 
 
found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the 
feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
 
36  They also which saw it told them by what means he that was 
possessed of the devils was healed. 
37  Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round 
about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with 
 
great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. 
 
38  Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought 
him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
 
39  Return to thine own house, and show how great things God hath 
done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout 
the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

40  ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people 
gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.
