  369    Numbers 23 
and let my last end be like his! 
 
11  ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I 
 
took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed 
them altogether. 
12  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that 
which the Lord hath put in my mouth? 
 
13  ¶ And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto 
another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see 
 
but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse 
 
me them from thence. 
14  And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, 
and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every 
altar. 
15  And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I 
meet the Lord yonder. 
16  And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, 
Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 
17  And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, 
and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What 
hath the Lord spoken? 
 
18  And he took up his parable, and said, 
Rise up, Balak, and hear; 
 
hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 
 
19  God is not a man, that he should lie; 
 
neither the son of man, that he should repent: 
 
hath he said, and shall he not do it? 
 
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
 
20  Behold, I have received commandment to bless: 
 
and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 
 
21  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, 
neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: 
 
the Lord his God is with him, 
and the shout of a king is among them. 
22  God brought them out of Egypt; 
 
he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.
