  807    1 Kings 15 
11  And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did 
David his father. 
12  And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all 
the idols that his fathers had made.  
13  And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being 
queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed 
 
her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron. 
14  But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was 
 
perfect with the Lord all his days. 
15  And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and 
the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the 
Lord, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
Asa’s League with Ben-hadad 
16  ¶ And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their 
days. 
17  And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, 
that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of 
Judah. 
18  Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the 
treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s 
house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king 
 
Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of 
Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
19  There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and 
thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and 
 
gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he 
 
may depart from me. 
20  So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of 
the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, 
and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the 
land of Naphtali. 
21  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off 
building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
