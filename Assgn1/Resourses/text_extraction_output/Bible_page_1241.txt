  1242    Psalms 35 
but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. 
20  He keepeth all his bones: 
 
not one of them is broken.  
21  Evil shall slay the wicked: 
 
and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. 
22  The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: 
 
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

A Prayer for Rescue from Enemies 
A Psalm of David. 
1  Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: 
 
fight against them that fight against me. 
2  Take hold of shield and buckler, 
and stand up for mine help. 
3  Draw out also the spear, 
and stop the way against them that persecute me: 
 
say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. 
4  Let them be confounded and put to shame 
that seek after my soul: 
 
let them be turned back and brought to confusion 
that devise my hurt. 
5  Let them be as chaff before the wind: 
 
and let the angel of the Lord chase them. 
6  Let their way be dark and slippery: 
 
and let the angel of the Lord persecute them. 
7  For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, 
which without cause they have digged for my soul. 
8  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; 
 
and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: 
 
into that very destruction let him fall. 
9  And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord:
