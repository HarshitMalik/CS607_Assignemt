  858    2 Kings 10 
7  And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took 
the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in 
baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. 
8  And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have 
brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in 
two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
9  And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, 
and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired 
 
against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? 
   
10  Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word 
of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: 
 
for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah. 
11  So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and 
all his great men, and his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him 
none remaining. 
12  ¶ And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at 
the shearing house in the way, 
13  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, 
Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; 
   
and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children 
of the queen. 
14  And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew 
them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; 
 
neither left he any of them. 
15  ¶ And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the 
son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to 
 
him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And 
 
Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave 
him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. 
 
16  And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. So they 
made him ride in his chariot. 
17  And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto 
Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying 
of the Lord, which he spake to Elijah.
