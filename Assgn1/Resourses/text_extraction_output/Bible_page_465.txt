  466    Deuteronomy 25 
19  ¶ When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast 
forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall 
 
be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the 
 
Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her. 
6  And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in 
the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out

7  And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his
