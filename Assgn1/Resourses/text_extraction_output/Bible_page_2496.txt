  2497    Ephesians 6 
28  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that 
loveth his wife loveth himself. 
29  For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and 
 
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 
 
30  for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 
31  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be 
joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  
32  This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the 
 
church. 
33  Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife 
even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. 
 
6 
1  Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.  
 
2  Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment 
 
with promise; 
 
3  that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the 
earth.  
4  And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring 
 
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 
5  Â¶ Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to 
the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as 
unto Christ; 
 
6  not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, 
 
doing the will of God from the heart; 
 
7  with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
 
8  knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same 
shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.  
9  And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing 
threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is 
   
there respect of persons with him.
