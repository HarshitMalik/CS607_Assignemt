After being separated from the Lord for countless incarnations, I am re-united with Him, 
entering the Sanctuary of the True, True, True Guru.  || 4 ||   There is one bed for the 
soul-bride, and the same bed for God, her Lord and Master. The self-willed manmukh 
does  not  obtain  the  Mansion  of  the  Lord‟s  Presence;  she  wanders  around,  in  limbo. 
Uttering, “Guru, Guru”, she seeks His Sanctuary; so God comes to meet her, without a 
moment‟s delay.  || 5 ||   One may perform many rituals, but the mind is filled with 
hypocrisy, evil deeds and greed. When a son is born in the house of a prostitute, who 
can tell the name of his father?  || 6 ||   Because of devotional worship in my past 
incarnations, I have been born into this life. The Guru has inspired me to worship the 
Lord,  Har,  Har,  Har,  Har.  Worshipping,  worshipping  Him  with  devotion,  I  found  the 
Lord, and then I merged into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har.  || 7 ||   God 
Himself came and ground the henna leaves into powder, and applied it to my body. Our 
Lord and Master showers His Mercy upon us, and grasps hold of our arms; O Nanak, He 
lifts us up and saves us.  || 8 || 6 || 9 || 2 || 1 || 6 || 9 ||

NE  NIVERSAL  REATOR  OD.   Y THE  RACE OF THE  RUE  URU:   
I cannot express the Praises of my God; I cannot express His Praises. I have abandoned 
all others, seeking His Sanctuary.  || 1 ||  Pause  ||   God‟s Lotus Feet are Infinite. I am 
forever a sacrifice to Them. My mind is in love with Them. If I were to abandon Them, 
there is nowhere else I could go.  || 1 ||   I chant the Lord‟s Name with my tongue. The 
filth of my sins and evil mistakes is burnt off. Climbing aboard the Boat of the Saints, I 
am emancipated. I have been carried across the terrifying world-ocean.  || 2 ||   My 
mind is tied to the Lord with the string of love and devotion. This is the Immaculate 
Way of the Saints. They forsake sin and corruption. They meet the Formless Lord God.  
|| 3 ||   Gazing upon God, I am wonderstruck. I taste the Perfect Flavor of Bliss. I do 
not  waver  or  wander  here  or  there.  The  Lord  God,  Har,  Har,  dwells  within  my 
consciousness.  || 4 ||   Those who constantly remember God, the treasure of virtue, 
will never go to hell. Those who listen, fascinated, to the Unstruck Sound-Current of the 
Word, will never have to see the Messenger of Death with their eyes.  || 5 ||   I seek 
the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Heroic Lord of the World. The Merciful Lord God is under 
the power of His devotees. The Vedas do not know the Mystery of the Lord. The silent 
sages constantly serve Him.  || 6 ||   He is the Destroyer of the pains and sorrows of 
the poor. It is so very difficult to serve Him. No one knows His limits. He is pervading 
the water, the land and the sky.  || 7 ||   Hundreds of thousands of times, I humbly 
bow to Him. I have grown weary, and I have collapsed at God‟s Door. O God, make me 
the dust of the feet of the Holy. Please fulfill this, Nanak‟s wish.  || 8 || 1 ||   BILAAVAL,  
FIFTH MEHL:  God, please release me from birth and death. I have grown weary, and 
collapsed at Your door. I grasp Your Feet, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the 
Holy. The Love of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet to my mind.
