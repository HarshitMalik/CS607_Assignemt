  1535    Isaiah 26 
he bringeth it even to the dust. 
6  The foot shall tread it down, 
even the feet of the poor, 
and the steps of the needy. 
7  The way of the just is uprightness: 
 
thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. 
8  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, 
have we waited for thee; 
 
the desire of our soul is to thy name, 
and to the remembrance of thee. 
9  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; 
 
yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: 
 
for when thy judgments are in the earth, 
the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 
10  Let favor be showed to the wicked, 
yet will he not learn righteousness: 
 
in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, 
and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. 
11  Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, 
they will not see: 
 
but they shall see, and be ashamed 
for their envy at the people; 
 
yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.  
12  Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: 
 
for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. 
13  O Lord our God, 
other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; 
 
but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. 
14  They are dead, they shall not live; 
 
they are deceased, they shall not rise: 
 
therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, 
and made all their memory to perish. 
15  Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord, 
thou hast increased the nation; 
 
thou art glorified:
