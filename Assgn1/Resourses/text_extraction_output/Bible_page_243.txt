  244    Leviticus 8 
12  And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and 
anointed him, to sanctify him. 
13  And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and 
girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses. 
14  ¶ And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and 
 
his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin 
offering. 
15  And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the 
 
horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the 
altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and 
sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. 
16  And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul 
above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses 
burned it upon the altar. 
17  But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with 
fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses. 
 
18  ¶ And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his 
 
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
19  And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar 
 
round about. 
20  And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the 
 
pieces, and the fat. 
21  And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt 
 
the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet 
 
savor, and an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord 
 
commanded Moses. 
22  ¶ And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and 
 
Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
23  And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon 
 
the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, 
and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
24  And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the 
tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and
