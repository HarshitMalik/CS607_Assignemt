  2134    Mark 12 
The Question about the Resurrection 
18  ¶ Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no 
resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
 
19  Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his 
wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take 
his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  
20  Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and 
 
dying left no seed. 
21  And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the 
 
third likewise. 
22  And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died 
 
also. 
23  In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall 
she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 
 
24  ¶ And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, 
because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God? 
 
25  For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are 
given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. 
 
26  And as touching the dead, that they rise; have ye not read in the 
 
book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am 
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 
 
27  He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye 
 
therefore do greatly err. 
The Great Commandment 
28  ¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning 
together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked 
him, Which is the first commandment of all? 
 
29  And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, 
Hear, O Israel; 
 
The Lord our God is one Lord: 
 
30  and thou shalt love the Lord thy God 
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
