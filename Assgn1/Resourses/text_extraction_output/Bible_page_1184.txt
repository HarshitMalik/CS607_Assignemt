  1185    Job 34 
let us know among ourselves what is good. 
5  For Job hath said, I am righteous: 
 
and God hath taken away my judgment. 
6  Should I lie against my right? 
 
My wound is incurable without transgression. 
7  What man is like Job, 
who drinketh up scorning like water? 
 
8  which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, 
and walketh with wicked men. 
9  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing 
that he should delight himself with God. 
10  Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: 
 
far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; 
 
and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 
11  For the work of a man shall he render unto him,  
and cause every man to find according to his ways. 
12  Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, 
neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 
13  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? 
 
Or who hath disposed the whole world? 
 
14  If he set his heart upon man, 
if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 
 
15  all flesh shall perish together, 
and man shall turn again unto dust. 
16  If now thou hast understanding, hear this: 
 
hearken to the voice of my words. 
17  Shall even he that hateth right govern? 
 
And wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
 
18  Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? 
 
and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 
 
19  How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, 
nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? 
 
For they all are the work of his hands. 
20  In a moment shall they die, 
and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away:
