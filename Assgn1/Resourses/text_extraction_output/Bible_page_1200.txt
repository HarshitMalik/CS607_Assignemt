  1201    Job 42 
15  And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of 
Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
 
16  After this lived Job a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and 
his sonsâ€™ sons, even four generations. 
17  So Job died, being old and full of days.
