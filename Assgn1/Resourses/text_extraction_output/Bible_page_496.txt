  497    Joshua 2 
2  And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men 
in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country. 
3  And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the 
men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for 
 
they be come to search out all the country. 
4  And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, 
There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 
 
5  and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it 
was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went, I wot not: 
   
pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. 
 
6  But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid 
them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the 
roof. 
7  And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: 
 
and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they 
shut the gate. 
8  ¶ And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon 
the roof; 
 
9  and she said unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you 
the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the 
inhabitants of the land faint because of you. 
10  For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red sea 
for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two 
 
kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon 
and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.  
11  And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, 
neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of 
you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in 
 
earth beneath. 
12  Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I 
have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness unto my 
father’s house, and give me a true token: 
 
13  and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my 
brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our 
lives from death.
