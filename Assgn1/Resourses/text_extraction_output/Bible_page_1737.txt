  1738    Jeremiah 52 
27  And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in 
Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive 
out of his own land. 
28  ¶ This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in 
 
the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 
 
29  in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive 
from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
 
30  in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan 
the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven 
hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand 
 
and six hundred. 
Jehoiachin Released and Honored in Babylon 
31  ¶ And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity 
of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and 
twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in 
the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of 
Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, 
32  and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of 
the kings that were with him in Babylon, 
33  and changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread 
 
before him all the days of his life. 
34  And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of 
Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days 
of his life.
