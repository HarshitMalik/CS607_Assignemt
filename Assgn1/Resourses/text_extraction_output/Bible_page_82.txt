  83    Genesis 34 
20  And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, 
and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
21  These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the 
 
land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for 
 
them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give 
 
them our daughters. 
22  Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to 
be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are 
circumcised. 
23  Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be 
ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
 
24  And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that 
went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all 
 
that went out of the gate of his city. 
25  ¶ And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that 
two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took 
each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the 
males. 
26  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the 
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out. 
27  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because 
they had defiled their sister. 
28  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that 
which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
29  and all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took 
they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 
30  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make 
me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the 
Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall 
 
gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be 
 
destroyed, I and my house. 
31  And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
