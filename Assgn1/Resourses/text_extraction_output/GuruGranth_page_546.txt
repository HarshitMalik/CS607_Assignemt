Prays Nanak, please give me Your Hand and save me, O Lord of the Universe, Merciful 
to the meek.  || 4 ||   That day is judged to be fruitful, when I met with the Lord God. 
Total happiness was revealed, and pain was taken far away. Intuitive peace and poise, 
joy and eternal happiness come from constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord 
of the World. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I lovingly worship the 
Lord; I shall not wander again in reincarnation. He has hugged me close in His Loving 
Embrace, with intuitive ease, and the seed of my primal destiny has sprouted. Prays 
Nanak,  He  Himself  has  met  me;  He  shall  never  leave  me  again.    ||  5  ||  4  ||  7  ||   
BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT:  Listen to my prayer, O my Lord and Master. I 
am filled with millions of sins, but still, I am Your slave. O Destroyer of pain, Bestower 
of  mercy,  Fascinating  Lord,  Destroyer  of  sorrow  and  strife:  I  have  come  to  Your 
Sanctuary; please preserve my honor. You are in all, O Immaculate Lord. God hears 
and beholds all; He is with us, the nearest of the near. O Lord and Master, hear Nanak‟s 
prayer; please save the servants of Your household.  || 1 ||   You are eternal and all-
powerful; I am a mere beggar, Lord. I am intoxicated with emotional attachment to 
Maya — save me, Lord! Bound down by greed, emotional attachment and corruption, I 
have  made  all  sorts  of  bad  mistakes.  The  creator  is  detached,  and  free  of 
entanglement; one obtains the fruits of his own actions. Be kind to me, O Purifier of 
sinners; I am so tired of wandering through reincarnation. Prays Nanak, I am the slave 
of the Lord; God is the Support of my soul, and my breath of life.  || 2 ||   You are 
great and all-powerful; my understanding is shallow, O Lord. You cherish even those 
who  are  ungrateful;  Your  Glance  of  Grace  is  perfect,  Lord.  Your  wisdom  is 
unfathomable, O  Infinite  Creator. I am lowly  —  I know nothing  at all. Rejecting the 
jewel, I have saved the shell; I am a lowly, ignorant beast. I have gathered that fickle 
wealth which will forsake me; I committed sins, over and over again. Nanak seeks Your 
Sanctuary,  Almighty  Lord  and  Master;  please,  preserve  my  honor.    ||  3  ||      I  was 
separated from Him, and now, He has united me with Himself. In the Saadh Sangat, the 
Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Singing the Praises of the 
Lord of the Universe, forever sublime, the blissful Lord is revealed to me. My bed is 
adorned with God; my God has made me His own. Abandoning anxiety, I have become 
carefree,  and  I  shall  not  suffer  in  pain  any  more.  Nanak  lives  by  gazing  upon  the 
Blessed Vision of His Darshan, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, 
the Ocean of excellence.  || 4 || 5 || 8 ||   BIHAAGRAA,  FIFTH MEHL,  CHHANT:  O 
you  of righteous faith, chant the Lord‟s Name; why do you remain silent? with your 
eyes, you have seen the treacherous ways of Maya. Nothing shall go along with you, 
except the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Land and clothes, gold and silver — all of 
these things are useless. Children, spouse and worldly honors, elephants, horses and 
other corrupting influences shall not go with you.
