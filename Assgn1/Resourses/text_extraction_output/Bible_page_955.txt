  956    1 Chronicles 23 
The Divisions and Duties of the Levites 
2  ¶ And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests 
and the Levites. 
3  Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and 
upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty 
 
and eight thousand. 
4  Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work 
of the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and 
 
judges: 
 
5  moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised 
 
the Lord with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise 
therewith. 
6  And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, 
namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
7  ¶ Of the Gershonites were Laadan, and Shimei. 
8  The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, 
 
three. 
9  The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. 
 
These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 
10  And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. 
These four were the sons of Shimei. 
11  And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and 
 
Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, 
 
according to their father’s house. 
12  ¶ The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
 
13  The sons of Amram; Aaron, and Moses: and Aaron was separated, 
   
that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for 
ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and 
to bless in his name for ever.  
14  Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the 
tribe of Levi. 
15  The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. 
16  Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
