  1666    Jeremiah 25 
13  And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have 
pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which 
Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. 
14  For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them 
also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and 
 
according to the works of their own hands. 
The Cup of Wrath for the Nations 
15  ¶ For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the winecup 
 
of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send 
thee, to drink it. 
16  And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the 
sword that I will send among them. 
17  ¶ Then took I the cup at the Lord’s hand, and made all the nations 
to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me: 
 
18  to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and 
the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a 
hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; 
   
19  Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his 
people; 
 
20  and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and 
all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and 
Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 
21  Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 
22  and all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings 
of the isles which are beyond the sea, 
23  Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners, 
24  and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people 
that dwell in the desert, 
25  and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the 
kings of the Medes, 
26  and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and 
all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: 
 
and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
