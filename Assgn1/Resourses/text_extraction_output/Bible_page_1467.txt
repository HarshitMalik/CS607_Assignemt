  1468    Ecclesiastes 5 
11  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be 
 
warm alone? 
 
12  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a 
 
threefold cord is not quickly broken. 
13  ¶ Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, 
who will no more be admonished. 
14  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in 
 
his kingdom becometh poor. 
15  I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the 
second child that shall stand up in his stead. 
16  There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before 
them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this 
 
also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
5 
The Folly of Rash Vows 
1  Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more 
ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider 
 
not that they do evil. 
2  Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to 
utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon 
 
earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
 
3  ¶ For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a 
 
fool’s voice is known by multitude of words. 
4  ¶ When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he 
 
hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
 
5  Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest 
vow and not pay. 
6  Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou 
 
before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be 
 
angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
 
7  ¶ For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also 
divers vanities: but fear thou God.
