THE BODY
The  human  body  has  three  chambers  in  front,  called  the
nirvana  chamber,  the  crimson  chamber,  and  the  chamber
of  the  yellow  court.  These  are  where  spirit  and  energy
dwell.  In  back  there  are  three  passes,  called  the  coccyx
pass,  the  midspine  pass,  and  the  jade  pillow  pass.  These
constitute the route along which spirit and energy course.
Mencius  said,  “Sage  emperors  Yao  and  Shun  did  it  by
nature; Kings Tang and Wu did it by rediscovery.” He also
said, “Tang and Wu did it in person.” This is just a matter
of  rediscovering  it  in  oneself.  Kings  Tang  and  Wu  were
able to rediscover Emperors Yao and Shun in the bodies of
Tang and Wu; if we are able to rediscover it in ourselves,
there  is  a  sage  emperor  Yao  and  a  sage  emperor  Shun  in
every one of us.
When  we  inwardly  examine  the  body,  energy  is  there.
When  we  inwardly  examine  that  energy,  spirit  is  there.
Because  cultivated  people  follow  the  Way  with  their
bodies, when the body is cultivated the Way is established.
Immature people follow desires with their bodies, so their
desires flourish while their bodies pass away.
The  Shurangama  Sutra  says,  “Deeply  entering  one
gateway,  enter  one  without  straying;  when  you  know  the
root,  the  six  senses  are  clear  and  calm  all  at  once.”  The
reason people are unable to attain the Way is because they
are burdened by the body.
If you want to get rid of this burden, you should realize
this  body  is  an  impermanent  thing,  a  painful  material
