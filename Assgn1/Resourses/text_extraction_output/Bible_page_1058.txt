The Restoration of Worship 
1  And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel 
were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one 
man to Jerusalem. 
2  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the 
priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and 
builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings 
thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.  
3  And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them 
 
because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt 
 
offerings thereon unto the Lord, even burnt offerings morning 
and evening.  
4  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered 
the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as 
the duty of every day required;  
 
5  and afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new 
moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, 
and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the 
Lord. 
6  From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt 
offerings unto the Lord. But the foundation of the temple of the 
Lord was not yet laid. 
7  They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and 
 
meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, 
to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to 
the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. 
The Rebuilding of the Temple Begun 
8  Â¶ Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at 
Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of 
Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their
