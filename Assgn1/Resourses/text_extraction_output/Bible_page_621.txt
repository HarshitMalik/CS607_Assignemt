  622    1 Samuel 2 
24  And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with 
three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and 
brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child 
 
was young. 
25  And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
26  And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the 
woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. 
27  For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition 
 
which I asked of him: 
 
28  therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he 
 
shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.

The Song of Hannah 
1  And Hannah prayed, and said, 
My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, 
mine horn is exalted in the Lord; 
 
my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; 
 
because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
2  There is none holy as the Lord: 
 
for there is none besides thee: 
 
neither is there any rock like our God. 
3  Talk no more so exceeding proudly; 
 
let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: 
 
for the Lord is a God of knowledge, 
and by him actions are weighed. 
4  The bows of the mighty men are broken, 
and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 
5  They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; 
 
and they that were hungry ceased: 
 
so that the barren hath borne seven; 
 
and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. 
6  The Lord killeth, and maketh alive:
