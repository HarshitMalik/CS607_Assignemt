  2078    Matthew 24 
10  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, 
and shall hate one another. 
11  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 
12  And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 
13  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  
14  And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world 
for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. 
 
15  ¶ When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, 
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso 
readeth, let him understand,) 
16  then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: 
 
17  let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing 
out of his house: 
 
18  neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.  
19  And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck 
in those days! 
 
20  But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the 
sabbath day: 
 
21  for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the 
beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 
22  And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh 
be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. 
 
23  Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; 
 
believe it not. 
24  For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show 
great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they 
 
shall deceive the very elect. 
25  Behold, I have told you before. 
26  Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go 
 
not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. 
   
27  For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto 
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
 
28  For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered 
together.
