  1403    Proverbs 1 
14  cast in thy lot among us; 
 
let us all have one purse: 
 
15  my son, walk not thou in the way with them; 
 
refrain thy foot from their path: 
 
16  for their feet run to evil, 
and make haste to shed blood. 
17  Surely in vain the net is spread 
in the sight of any bird. 
18  And they lay wait for their own blood; 
 
they lurk privily for their own lives. 
19  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; 
 
which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 
20  Wisdom crieth without; 
 
she uttereth her voice in the streets: 
 
21  she crieth in the chief place of concourse, 
in the openings of the gates: 
 
in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 
22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? 
 
and the scorners delight in their scorning, 
and fools hate knowledge? 
 
23  Turn you at my reproof: 
 
behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, 
I will make known my words unto you. 
24  Because I have called, and ye refused; 
 
I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
 
25  but ye have set at nought all my counsel, 
and would none of my reproof: 
 
26  I also will laugh at your calamity; 
 
I will mock when your fear cometh; 
 
27  when your fear cometh as desolation, 
and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; 
 
when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
28  Then shall they call upon me, 
but I will not answer; 
 
they shall seek me early,
