  1407    Proverbs 3 
by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
20  By his knowledge the depths are broken up, 
and the clouds drop down the dew. 
21  My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: 
 
keep sound wisdom and discretion: 
 
22  so shall they be life unto thy soul, 
and grace to thy neck. 
23  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, 
and thy foot shall not stumble. 
24  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: 
 
yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
25  Be not afraid of sudden fear, 
neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 
26  For the Lord shall be thy confidence, 
and shall keep thy foot from being taken. 
27  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, 
when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. 
28  Say not unto thy neighbor, 
Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; 
 
when thou hast it by thee. 
29  Devise not evil against thy neighbor, 
seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 
30  Strive not with a man without cause, 
if he have done thee no harm. 
31  Envy thou not the oppressor, 
and choose none of his ways. 
32  For the froward is abomination to the Lord: 
 
but his secret is with the righteous. 
33  The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: 
 
but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 
34  Surely he scorneth the scorners: 
 
but he giveth grace unto the lowly.  
35  The wise shall inherit glory: 
 
but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
