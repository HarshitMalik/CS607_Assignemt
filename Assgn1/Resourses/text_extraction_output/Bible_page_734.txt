  735    2 Samuel 17 
20  And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, 
they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said 
 
unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they 
had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
21  ¶ And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up 
out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, 
Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel 
 
counseled against you. 
22  Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they 
passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of 
 
them that was not gone over Jordan. 
23  ¶ And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he 
saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his 
city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, 
and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 
24  ¶ Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over 
Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
25  And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: 
 
which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, 
that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah 
Joab’s mother. 
26  So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
27  ¶ And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that 
Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and 
Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite 
of Rogelim, 
28  brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and 
barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and 
parched pulse, 
29  and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, 
and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The 
 
people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
