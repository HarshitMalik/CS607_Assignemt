  2235    Luke 23 
11  And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked 
him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to 
Pilate. 
12  And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for 
 
before they were at enmity between themselves. 
Jesus Sentenced to Die 
13  ¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the 
rulers and the people, 
14  said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that 
perverteth the people; and, behold, I, having examined him before 
 
you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof 
ye accuse him: 
 
15  no, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of 
   
death is done unto him. 
16  I will therefore chastise him, and release him. 
17  (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
18  ¶ And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and 
release unto us Barabbas: 
 
19  (who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was 
cast into prison.) 
20  Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
21  But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. 
22  And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he 
done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore 
   
chastise him, and let him go. 
23  And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be 
crucified: and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
 
24  And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
25  And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was 
cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to 
 
their will.
