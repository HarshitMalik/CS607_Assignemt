it is forgetting repute; few in the world attain this, so it is
considered difficult.
The noble who can be unaffected and the rich who are
not extravagant can keep their riches and nobility because
they  are  not  excessively  mundane.  Those  who  can  be
unshakably stable and insightful without exploiting it can
profoundly  realize  true  eternity  because  they  are  not
excessive in religion. Chuang-tzu said, “It is easy to know
the Way; it is hard not to speak of it.”
To know but not speak of it is the way to get to heaven.
To know and speak of it is the way to get to humanity. The
people of old were divine, not human.
Insight  can  know  the  Way,  but  this  is  not  attaining  the
Way. People may know the advantages of gaining insight
without  realizing  the  benefits  of  attaining  the  Way.  “Use
insight to clarify the ultimate principle, employ eloquence
to  move  people’s  feelings  and  arouse  their  hearts,
increasing in the course of events, coming in contact with
others. If you only speak of constant calm in the midst of
activity,  how  can  you  know  that  calmness  is  a  matter  of
being calm in order to deal with people?” These words do
not  express  tranquil  stabilization.  Even  if  you  are
intellectually  outstanding,  that  only  makes  you  so  much
less  near  to  the  Way.  You  may  have  originally  gone
chasing deer, but you are going home with a rabbit. What
you  have  got  is  extremely  slight,  because  you  are  being
small-minded.
