  162    Exodus 16 
3  and the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had 
died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by 
the fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have 
 
brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly 
with hunger. 
4  ¶ Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from 
heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain 
 
rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in 
my law, or no. 
5  And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare 
that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they 
 
gather daily. 
6  And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, 
then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the 
land of Egypt: 
 
7  and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for 
 
that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are 
 
we, that ye murmur against us? 
 
8  And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the 
evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that 
 
the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against 
him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but 
   
against the Lord. 
9  ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of 
the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath 
 
heard your murmurings. 
10  And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of 
the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, 
behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. 
11  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
12  I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto 
 
them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall 
be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your 
 
God.
