Devoted to His Worship, he remains attached to the Lord‟s Feet.  || 3 ||   All the gods, 
silent  sages,  Indra,  Shiva  and  Yogis  have  not  found  the  Lord‟s  limits  —  not  even 
Brahma who contemplates the Vedas. I shall not give up meditating on the Lord, even 
for an instant. The God of Mat‟huraa is Merciful to the meek; He blesses and uplifts the 
Sangats throughout the Universe. Guru Raam Daas, to save the world, enshrined the 
Guru‟s Light into Guru Arjun.  || 4 ||   In this world, there is no other Great Soul; the 
Lord revealed Himself, incarnated as Guru Arjun. Millions of pains are taken away, from 
those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, says Mat‟huraa. O mortal being, 
do not leave this path; do not think that there is any difference between God and Guru. 
The Perfect Lord God has manifested Himself; He dwells in the heart of Guru Arjun.  || 
5 ||   As long as the destiny written upon my forehead was not activated, I wandered 
around lost, running in all directions. I was drowning in the horrible world-ocean of this 
Dark Age of Kali Yuga, and my remorse would never have ended. O Mat‟huraa, consider 
this essential truth: to save the world, the Lord incarnated Himself. Whoever meditates 
on Guru Arjun Dayv, shall not have to pass through the painful womb of reincarnation 
ever again.  || 6 ||   In the ocean of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord‟s Name has 
been revealed in the Form of Guru Arjun, to save the world. Pain and poverty are taken 
away  from  that  person,  within  whose  heart  the  Saint  abides.  He  is  the  Pure, 
Immaculate Form of the Infinite Lord; except for Him, there is no other at all. Whoever 
knows Him in thought, word and deed, becomes just like Him. He is totally pervading 
the earth, the sky and the nine regions of the planet. He is the Embodiment of the Light 
of God. So speaks Mat‟huraa: there is no difference between God and Guru; Guru Arjun 
is the Personification of the Lord Himself.  || 7 || 19 ||   The Water of the Guru is like 
the Ganges, invincible and unstoppable. The Sikhs of the Sangat all bathe in it. The 
Puraanaas dwell continually upon the Guru; Brahma sings His Praises in the Vedas. The 
invincible chauri, the fly-brush, waves over His head; with His mouth, He drinks in the 
Ambrosial  Nectar  of  the  Naam.  The  Transcendent  Lord  Himself  has placed the royal 
canopy over the head of Guru Arjun. Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas and 
Guru Raam Daas met together before the Lord. So speaks Harbans: Their Praises echo 
and resound all over the world; who can possibly say that the Great Gurus are dead?  || 
1 ||   When it was the Will of the Transcendent Lord Himself, Guru Raam Daas went to 
the City of God. The Lord offered Him His Royal Throne, and seated the Guru upon it. 
The angels and gods were delighted; they proclaimed and celebrated Your victory, O 
Guru. The demons ran away; their sins made them shake and tremble inside. Those 
people who found Guru Raam daas were rid of their sins. He gave the Royal Canopy 
and Throne to Guru Arjun, and came home.  || 2 || 21 || 9 || 11 || 10 || 10 || 22 || 60
