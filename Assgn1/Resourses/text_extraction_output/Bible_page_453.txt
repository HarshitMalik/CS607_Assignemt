  454    Deuteronomy 19 
4  ¶ And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he 
may live: Whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated 
 
not in time past; 
 
5  as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew 
wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the 
tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his 
neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: 
   
6  lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is 
hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; 
 
whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not 
in time past. 
7  Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities 
for thee. 
8  And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto 
thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give 
unto thy fathers; 
 
9  if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I 
command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to walk 
ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, 
 
beside these three: 
 
10  that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the Lord thy 
God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. 
11  ¶ But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise 
up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into 
one of these cities; 
 
12  then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and 
deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
13  Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of 
innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. 
14  ¶ Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s landmark, which they of 
old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in 
the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.
