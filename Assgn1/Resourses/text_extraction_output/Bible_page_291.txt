  292    Leviticus 25 
46  And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after 
you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen 
 
for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not 
 
rule one over another with rigor.  
47  ¶ And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother 
that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or 
sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family: 
 
48  after that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren 
 
may redeem him: 
 
49  either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is 
nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be 
 
able, he may redeem himself. 
50  And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that 
he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale 
 
shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time 
of a hired servant shall it be with him. 
51  If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give 
again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was 
bought for. 
52  And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he 
shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give 
him again the price of his redemption. 
53  And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other 
 
shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight. 
54  And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the 
year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him. 
55  For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my 
 
servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
 
Lord your God.
