  2308    Acts 1 
11  which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into 
heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, 
 
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. 
Judas’ Successor Chosen 
12  ¶ Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called 
Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey. 
13  And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, 
where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, 
and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, 
and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.  
14  These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, 
with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his 
brethren. 
15  ¶ And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and 
said, (the number of names together were about a hundred and 
twenty,) 
16  Men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, 
which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before 
concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. 
17  For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this 
ministry. 
18  Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and 
 
falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels 
gushed out. 
19  And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as 
 
that field is called, in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, 
The field of blood.  
20  For it is written in the book of Psalms, 
Let his habitation be desolate, 
and let no man dwell therein:  
 
and, 
His bishopric let another take.
