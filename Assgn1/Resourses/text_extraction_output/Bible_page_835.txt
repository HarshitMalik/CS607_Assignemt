  836    2 Kings 3 
21  And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in 
there, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; 
 
there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. 
22  So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of 
Elisha which he spake. 
23  ¶ And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up 
 
by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and 
mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, 
 
thou bald head. 
24  And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the 
name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the 
wood, and tare forty and two children of them. 
25  And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he 
returned to Samaria.

The Reign of Jehoram of Israel 
1  Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria 
in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned 
twelve years. 
2  And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord; but not like his 
 
father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that 
 
his father had made. 
3  Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of 
Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
 
Elisha Predicts Victory over Moab 
4  ¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto 
the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred 
thousand rams, with the wool. 
5  But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab 
rebelled against the king of Israel.
