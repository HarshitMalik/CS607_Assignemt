  2172    Luke 6 
22  ¶ Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall 
separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out 
your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.  
23  Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is 
 
great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the 
 
prophets.  
24  ¶ But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your 
 
consolation. 
25  ¶ Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you 
 
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. 
 
26  ¶ Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did 
 
their fathers to the false prophets.

27  ¶ But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to 
them which hate you, 
28  bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use 
you. 
29  And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the 
other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat 
 
also. 
30  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away 
 
thy goods ask them not again. 
31  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them 
likewise.  
32  ¶ For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for 
 
sinners also love those that love them. 
33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have 
ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
 
34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have 
ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
 
35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for 
nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the
