  207    Exodus 34 
34 
The Second Tables of Stone 
1  And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like 
unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were 
 
in the first tables, which thou brakest. 
2  And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto 
mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the 
mount. 
3  And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen 
throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed 
 
before that mount. 
4  And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses 
 
rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the 
Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of 
stone. 
5  And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, 
and proclaimed the name of the Lord. 
6  And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, 
The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and 
abundant in goodness and truth, 
7  keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression 
and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the 
 
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s 
children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.  
8  And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and 
worshipped. 
9  And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my 
Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and 
   
pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. 
10  ¶ And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I 
 
will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in 
any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the 
 
work of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
