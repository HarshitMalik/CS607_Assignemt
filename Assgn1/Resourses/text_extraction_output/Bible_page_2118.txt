  2119    Mark 8 
5  And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, 
 
Seven. 
6  And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he 
 
took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his 
disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people. 
 
7  And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded 
 
to set them also before them. 
8  So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken 
 
meat that was left seven baskets. 
9  And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent 
 
them away. 
10  And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came 
into the parts of Dalmanutha. 
The Demand for a Sign 
11  ¶ And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, 
seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
12  And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this 
generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no 
 
sign be given unto this generation. 
13  And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the 
other side. 
The Leaven of the Pharisees 
14  ¶ Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in 
the ship with them more than one loaf. 
15  And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of 
the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. 
16  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have 
no bread. 
17  And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, 
because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? 
   
have ye your heart yet hardened?
