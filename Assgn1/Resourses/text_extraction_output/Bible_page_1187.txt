  1188    Job 36 
yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: 
 
16  therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; 
 
he multiplieth words without knowledge. 
36 
Elihu Extols God’s Greatness 
1  Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
2  Suffer me a little, and I will show thee 
that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf. 
3  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, 
and will ascribe rightousness to my Maker. 
4  For truly my words shall not be false: 
 
he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 
5  Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: 
 
he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 
6  He preserveth not the life of the wicked: 
 
but giveth right to the poor. 
7  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: 
 
but with kings are they on the throne; 
 
yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
8  And if they be bound in fetters, 
and be holden in cords of affliction; 
 
9  then he showeth them their work, 
and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
10  He openeth also their ear to discipline, 
and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 
11  If they obey and serve him, 
they shall spend their days in prosperity, 
and their years in pleasures. 
12  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, 
and they shall die without knowledge. 
13  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: 
 
they cry not when he bindeth them.
