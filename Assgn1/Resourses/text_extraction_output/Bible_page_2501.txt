  2502    Philippians 2 
27  ¶ Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: 
 
that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of 
your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving 
together for the faith of the gospel; 
 
28  and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an 
 
evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
29  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe 
on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 
 
30  having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in 
me.

Christ’s Humiliation and Exaltation 
1  If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of 
love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 
2  fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being 
of one accord, of one mind. 
3  Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of 
 
mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 
4  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the 
things of others. 
5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
 
6  who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal 
with God: 
 
7  but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of 
a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
 
8  and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and 
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a 
name which is above every name: 
 
10  that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in 
heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
