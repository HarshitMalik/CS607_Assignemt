  119    Genesis 49 
18  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the 
 
firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
 
19  And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he 
 
also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his 
 
younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become 
a multitude of nations. 
20  And he blessed them that day, saying, 
In thee shall Israel bless, saying, 
God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: 
 
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
21  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with 
 
you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
22  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, 
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and 
with my bow.

Jacob’s Prophecy concerning His Sons 
1  And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves 
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last 
days. 
2  Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; 
 
and hearken unto Israel your father. 
3  Reuben, thou art my firstborn, 
my might, and the beginning of my strength, 
the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 
 
4  unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; 
 
because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; 
 
then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 
 
5  Simeon and Levi are brethren; 
 
instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
6  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; 
 
unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united:
