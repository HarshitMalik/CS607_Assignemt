  700    2 Samuel 3 
7  And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter 
of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in 
 
unto my father’s concubine? 
 
8  Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, 
Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do show kindness this day 
unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his 
friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that 
thou chargest me today with a fault concerning this woman? 
 
9  So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the Lord hath 
sworn to David, even so I do to him; 
 
10  to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the 
throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-
sheba. 
11  And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared 
him. 
12  ¶ And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, 
Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, 
 
behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto 
thee. 
13  And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I 
   
require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first 
bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face. 
14  And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying, 
Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred 
foreskins of the Philistines.  
15  And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from 
Phaltiel the son of Laish. 
16  And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to 
Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. 
17  ¶ And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, 
Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: 
 
18  now then do it: for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the 
 
hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the 
hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
