between the sanctuary and the profane place.

earth shined with his glory. 
3  And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, 
even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the 
city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river 
 
Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

gate whose prospect is toward the east. 
5  So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, 
 
behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.

children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of 
Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their 
whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places. 
8  In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post 
by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even
