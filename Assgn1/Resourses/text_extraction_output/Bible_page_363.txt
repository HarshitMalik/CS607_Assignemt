  364    Numbers 22 
Israel Conquers Og of Bashan 
31  Â¶ Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
32  And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages 
thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. 
33  And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the 
 
king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the 
battle at Edrei. 
34  And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered 
 
him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt 
 
do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which 
dwelt at Heshbon. 
35  So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was 
none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

Balak Sends for Balaam 
1  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of 
Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho. 
2  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the 
Amorites. 
3  And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: 
 
and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
4  And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company 
lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of 
the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at 
that time. 
5  He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to 
Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his 
people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from 
Egypt: Behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over 
 
against me:
