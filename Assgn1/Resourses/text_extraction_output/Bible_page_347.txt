  348    Numbers 16 
Fringes on Garments 
37  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
38  Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make 
them fringes in the borders of their garments, throughout their 
generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a 
ribband of blue: 
 
39  and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and 
remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and 
 
that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after 
which ye use to go a whoring: 
 
40  that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy 
unto your God. 
41  I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of 
Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

Korah’s Rebellion 
1  Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, 
and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of 
Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: 
 
2  and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of 
Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the 
congregation, men of renown: 
 
3  and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against 
Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all 
the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is 
among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the 
 
congregation of the Lord? 
 
4  And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 
 
5  and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even 
tomorrow the Lord will show who are his, and who is holy; and
