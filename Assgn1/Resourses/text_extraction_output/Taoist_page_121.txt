marvel  of  the  body  in  itself.  Unashamed  of  their  own
shortcoming,  they  imitate  others’  errors.  They  are  like
summer insects that do not believe in ice or frost, or bugs
in  a  jar  that  deny  the  sky  and  earth.  They  cannot  be

SITTING FORGETTING
Essentials and Auxiliaries
If you want to cultivate the Way and attain realization, first
get rid of warped behaviors.
With  external  affairs  cut  off  so  that  there  is  nothing  to
get on your mind, then sit straight and gaze inwardly with
accurate awareness.
As  soon  as  you  notice  a  thought  arise,  immediately
extinguish  it;  arrest  thoughts  as  they  arise,  in  order  to
make your mind peaceful and quiet.
Next,  even  though  you  may  not  obviously  have  any
obsessions, still floating, wandering, random thoughts are
also to be extinguished.
Work  diligently  day  and  night,  never  giving  up  for  a
moment;  but  only  extinguish  the  stirring  mind,  do  not
extinguish the shining mind.
Disappear  into  the  empty  mind;  do  not  disappear  into
the possessive mind.
Do not dwell on any thing and the mind will be stable.
This  method  is  mysterious,  with  benefits  that  are  very
profound.  Unless  you  already  have  affinity  for  the  Way
