  2439    1 Corinthians 10 
20  And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to 
 
them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain 
them that are under the law; 
 
21  to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without 
law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them 
that are without law. 
22  To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am 
 
made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 
23  And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof 
with you. 
24  ¶ Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one 
receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
 
25  And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all 
things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an 
 
incorruptible. 
26  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that 
 
beateth the air: 
 
27  but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by 
 
any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a 
castaway.

Warning against Idolatry 
1  Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how 
that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the 
sea;  
 
2  and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
 
3  and did all eat the same spiritual meat;  
 
4  and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that 
 
spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. 
 
5  But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were 
 
overthrown in the wilderness.
