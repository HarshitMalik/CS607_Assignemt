  993    2 Chronicles 10 
2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in 
Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, 
heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
3  And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and

12  ¶ So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third 
day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
