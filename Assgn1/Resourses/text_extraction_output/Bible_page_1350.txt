  1351    Psalms 109 
11  Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? 
 
And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
 
12  Give us help from trouble: 
 
for vain is the help of man. 
13  Through God we shall do valiantly: 
 
for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

A Cry for Vengeance 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David. 
1  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 
 
2  for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are 
opened against me: 
 
they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 
3  They compassed me about also with words of hatred; 
 
and fought against me without a cause. 
4  For my love they are my adversaries: 
 
but I give myself unto prayer. 
5  And they have rewarded me evil for good, 
and hatred for my love. 
6  Set thou a wicked man over him: 
 
and let Satan stand at his right hand. 
7  When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: 
 
and let his prayer become sin. 
8  Let his days be few; 
 
and let another take his office.  
9  Let his children be fatherless, 
and his wife a widow. 
10  Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: 
 
let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 
11  Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
