  763    1 Kings 2 
3  and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to 
keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and 
his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou 
mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou 
turnest thyself: 
 
4  that the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning 
me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before 
me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall 
not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. 
5  ¶ Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to 
me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto 
Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he 
slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war 
upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were 
on his feet. 
6  Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go 
down to the grave in peace. 
7  But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let 
them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when 
 
I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
8  And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a 
Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in 
the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me 
 
at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put 
thee to death with the sword.  
9  Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and 
 
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head 
 
bring thou down to the grave with blood.
