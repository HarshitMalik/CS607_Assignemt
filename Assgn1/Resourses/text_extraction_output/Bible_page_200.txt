11  and the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: 
 
according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 
The Sabbath as a Sign 
12  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
13  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my 
sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you 
 
throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the 
 
Lord that doth sanctify you. 
14  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you. Every 
 
one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever 
 
doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his 
people. 
15  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, 
 
holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, 
 
he shall surely be put to death.  
16  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe 
the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
17  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six 
 
days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he 
rested, and was refreshed. 
The Golden Calf 
18  ¶ And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of 
communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, 
tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 
32 
1  And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of 
the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, 
and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for
