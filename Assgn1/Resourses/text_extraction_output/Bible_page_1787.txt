The Soul That Sins Shall Die 
1  The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, 
2  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of 
Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the 
children’s teeth are set on edge? 
 
3  As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to 
use this proverb in Israel. 
4  Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul 
 
of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. 
 
5  ¶ But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
6  and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his 
eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his 
neighbor’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 
7  and hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his 
pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the 
hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
 
8  he that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any 
increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath 
executed true judgment between man and man, 
9  hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal 
truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God. 
 
10  ¶ If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that 
doeth the like to any one of these things, 
11  and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon 
the mountains, and defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
12  hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath 
not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, 
hath committed abomination,
