  1244    Psalms 36 
23  Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, 
even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. 
24  Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness; 
 
and let them not rejoice over me. 
25  Let them not say in their hearts, 
Ah, so would we have it: 
 
let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 
26  Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together 
that rejoice at mine hurt: 
 
let them be clothed with shame and dishonor 
that magnify themselves against me. 
27  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, 
that favor my righteous cause: 
 
yea, let them say continually, 
Let the Lord be magnified, 
which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 
28  And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness 
and of thy praise all the day long. 
36 
The Steadfast Love of God 
To the chief Musician,  
A Psalm of David the servant of the Lord. 
1  The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, 
that there is no fear of God before his eyes.  
2  For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, 
until his iniquity be found to be hateful. 
3  The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: 
 
he hath left off to be wise, and to do good. 
4  He deviseth mischief upon his bed; 
 
he setteth himself in a way that is not good; 
 
he abhorreth not evil.
