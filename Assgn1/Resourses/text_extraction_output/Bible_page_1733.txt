  1734    Jeremiah 51 
48  Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for 
Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith 
 
the Lord. 
49  As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall 
fall the slain of all the earth.  
50  ¶ Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: 
 
remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your 
mind. 
51  We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath 
 
covered our faces; for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the 
 
Lord’s house. 
52  Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will do 
judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the 
 
wounded shall groan. 
53  Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she 
should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers 
come unto her, saith the Lord. 
54  ¶ A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from 
the land of the Chaldeans: 
 
55  because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her 
the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of 
 
their voice is uttered: 
 
56  because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her 
mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the 
 
Lord God of recompenses shall surely requite. 
57  And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, 
and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a 
 
perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is The 
Lord of hosts. 
58  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be 
 
utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and 
 
the people shall labor in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they 
shall be weary. 
59  ¶ The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the 
son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah
