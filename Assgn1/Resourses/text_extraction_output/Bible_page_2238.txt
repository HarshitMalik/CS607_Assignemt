  2239    Luke 24 
The Walk to Emmaus 
13  ¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called 
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. 
14  And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
15  And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and 
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
16  But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
17  And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these 
that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
 
18  And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said 
unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not 
known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
 
19  And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, 
 
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed 
and word before God and all the people: 
 
20  and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be 
condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
21  But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed 
Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these things 
 
were done. 
22  Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, 
which were early at the sepulchre; 
 
23  and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they 
had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
24  And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and 
found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
 
25  Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all 
that the prophets have spoken: 
 
26  ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his 
glory? 
 
27  And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto 
them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 
28  ¶ And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he 
 
made as though he would have gone further.
