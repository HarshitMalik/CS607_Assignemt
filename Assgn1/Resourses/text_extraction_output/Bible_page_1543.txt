  1544    Isaiah 30 
16  But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: 
     
and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue 
 
you be swift. 
17  One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five 
 
shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, 
 
and as an ensign on a hill. 
The Promise of God’s Grace to Israel 
18  ¶ And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto 
you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon 
you: for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that 
   
wait for him. 
19  For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no 
 
more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; 
   
when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. 
20  And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water 
of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any 
more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: 
 
21  and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the 
way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye 
turn to the left. 
22  Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and 
the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them 
 
away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. 
 
23  ¶ Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the 
ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be 
 
fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. 
 
24  The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat 
clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and 
with the fan. 
25  And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high 
hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, 
when the towers fall.
