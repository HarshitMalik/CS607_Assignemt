When your name is not on the rolls and your heart is not
on power and profit, this is how you shed the human shell
and become a companion of Heaven.
MINDLESSNESS AND MASTERY
Energy  is  hard  to  master;  it  is  swift  as  a  galloping  horse.
Only by calmness does it become easy.
Get  rid  of  external  longings.  If  you  see  the  hubbub  in
front of your eyes as if it were deep in the mountains, in
inaccessible valleys, this is the heart of a Wayfarer.
No one can exercise mastery without reaching the state
of mindlessness.
NATURAL PATTERNS
When the mind is stable, feelings are forgotten.
When the body is immaterial, energy circulates.
When the mind dies, the spirit lives.
When positivity is strong, negativity vanishes.
These are natural patterns.
SLEEPING TECHNIQUE
The subtlety of preserving nonvolatile energy is in keeping
vitality complete.
It is most important to be guarded when sleeping. When
you are going to sleep, keep accurate mindfulness present,
so myriad thoughts disappear.
