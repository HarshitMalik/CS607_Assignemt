  1267    Psalms 52 
and uphold me with thy free Spirit. 
13  Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; 
 
and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 
14  Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, 
thou God of my salvation: 
 
and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
15  O Lord, open thou my lips; 
 
and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. 
16  For thou desirest not sacrifice; 
 
else would I give it: 
 
thou delightest not in burnt offering. 
17  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: 
 
a broken and a contrite heart, O God, 
thou wilt not despise. 
18  Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: 
 
build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
19  Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, 
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: 
 
then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

The Futility of Boastful Wickedness 
To the chief Musician, Maschil,  
A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told 
Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of 
Ahimelech.  
1  Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? 
 
The goodness of God endureth continually. 
2  Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; 
 
like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
3  Thou lovest evil more than good; 
 
and lying rather than to speak righteousness.
