  1331    Psalms 97 
the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: 
 
he shall judge the people righteously. 
11  Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; 
 
let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 
12  Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: 
 
then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 
13  before the Lord: for he cometh, 
 
for he cometh to judge the earth: 
 
he shall judge the world with righteousness, 
and the people with his truth.

The Lordâ€™s Dominion and Power 
1  The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice; 
   
let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 
2  Clouds and darkness are round about him: 
 
righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 
3  A fire goeth before him, 
and burneth up his enemies round about. 
4  His lightnings enlightened the world: 
 
the earth saw, and trembled. 
5  The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, 
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
6  The heavens declare his righteousness, 
and all the people see his glory. 
7  Confounded be all they that serve graven images, 
that boast themselves of idols: 
 
worship him, all ye gods. 
8  Zion heard, and was glad; 
 
and the daughters of Judah rejoiced 
because of thy judgments, O Lord. 
9  For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth: 
 
thou art exalted far above all gods.
