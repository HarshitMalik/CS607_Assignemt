  2371    Acts 22 
8  And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am 
 
Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. 
9  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; 
 
but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 
10  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, 
 
Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all 
 
things which are appointed for thee to do. 
11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by 
the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. 
12  ¶ And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a 
good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, 
13  came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive 
thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. 
14  And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou 
shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear 
the voice of his mouth. 
15  For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen 
and heard. 
16  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away 
 
thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. 
Paul’s Call to the Gentiles 
17  ¶ And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, 
even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 
 
18  and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out 
of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning 
 
me. 
19  And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every 
synagogue them that believed on thee: 
 
20  and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was 
standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment 
of them that slew him.  
21  And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto 
 
the Gentiles.
