Knowledge  and  action  are  fundamentally  one  combined
effort. To always keep knowledge present is to be able to
act on it. Whenever you do not act on knowledge, you are
then ignorant.
Cultured  people  understand  the  Way  with  their  bodies;
wherever  the  body  is,  there  is  where  the  Way  is.  Thus
there  is  walking  exercise  for  when  you  are  walking,
standing  exercise  for  when  you  are  standing,  sitting

truth  is  not  realistic,  yet  you  insist  on  trying  to  act  on  it,
how much will and energy do you have? When your will
is  exhausted  and  your  energy  flags,  you  won’t  be  able  to
carry on.
Evening  and  nighttime  are  times  of  rest  for  cultivated
people.  Accordingly  you  should  withdraw  into  the
chamber  of  spirit  and  embrace  oneness  without  parting.
Since  there  are  no  worldly  feelings  enveloping  you,
neither  is  there  an  original  sublime  truth—when  you  are
like a dead man for the time being, that is called great rest.
After  you  get  to  the  point  of  dreaming  and  sleeping
