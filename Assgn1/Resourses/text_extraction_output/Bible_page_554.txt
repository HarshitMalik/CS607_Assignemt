  555    Judges 1 
21  And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that 
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of 
 
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.  
Joseph Conquers Beth-el 
22  ¶ And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and 
 
the Lord was with them. 
23  And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-el. (Now the name of 
the city before was Luz.) 
24  And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said 
unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we 
will show thee mercy. 
25  And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote 
the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all 
 
his family. 
26  And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and 
called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this 
 
day. 
The Extent of the Conquests of Manasseh and Ephraim 
27  ¶ Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and 
her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor 
and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor 
the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites 
 
would dwell in that land. 
28  And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the 
Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.  
29  ¶ Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in 
Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
