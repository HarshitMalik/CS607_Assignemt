  1162    Job 20 
17  He shall not see the rivers, 
the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 
18  That which he labored for shall he restore, 
and shall not swallow it down: 
 
according to his substance shall the restitution be, 
and he shall not rejoice therein. 
19  Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; 
 
because he hath violently taken away a house which he builded not. 
20  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, 
he shall not save of that which he desired. 
21  There shall none of his meat be left; 
 
therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
22  In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: 
 
every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 
23  When he is about to fill his belly, 
God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, 
and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. 
24  He shall flee from the iron weapon, 
and the bow of steel shall strike him through. 
25  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; 
 
yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: 
 
terrors are upon him. 
26  All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: 
 
a fire not blown shall consume him; 
 
it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
27  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; 
 
and the earth shall rise up against him. 
28  The increase of his house shall depart, 
and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
29  This is the portion of a wicked man from God, 
and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
