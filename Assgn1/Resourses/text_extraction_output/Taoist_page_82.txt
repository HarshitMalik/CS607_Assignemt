Master  Zhu  said,  “The  work  of  nurturing  the
fundamental  is  interrupted  very  easily.  However,  as  soon
as you become aware of the interruption, this is the point
of  resumption.  Just  keep  bringing  it  to  mind  all  the  time,
building  this  up  bit  by  bit,  until  eventually  there  is
spontaneous continuity, turning into one whole.”
Those  in  whom  vitality,  energy,  and  spirit  get  their
proper  nourishment  and  thrive  will  live;  those  in  whom
they miss their proper nourishment and fade will die. Try
examining this in the course of a single day; how much do
they  get  their  nourishment  and  thrive,  and  how  much  do
they miss their nourishment and fade? Then you can know
about  your  life  and  death  by  yourself,  without  using
divination.
The work of learning the Way requires greater intimacy
with each passing day, greater intimacy with each passing
hour. Eventually you develop spontaneous familiarity and
unite with the Way.
DISCIPLINE
Human beings have always acted on emotions and desires;
this  habit  is  so  deep-seated  that  if  they  seek  clarity  and
calm  one  day,  this  is  not  easy  to  achieve.  Therefore  it  is
necessary to keep discipline first.
Keeping discipline means purifying thought, word, and
deed.
