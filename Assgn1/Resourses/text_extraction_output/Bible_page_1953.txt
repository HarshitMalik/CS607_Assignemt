  1954    Micah 3 
6  ¶ Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not 
 
prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame. 
7  O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the Spirit of the Lord 
straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him 
   
that walketh uprightly? 
 
8  Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe 
 
with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse 
from war. 
9  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant 
houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. 
 
10  Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, 
   
it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. 
11  If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will 
prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be 
 
the prophet of this people. 
12  ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the 
 
remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, 
 
as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by 
 
reason of the multitude of men. 
13  The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and 
 
have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it; and their king 
 
shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them.

Israel’s Leaders Denounced 
1  And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the 
house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? 
   
2  Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from 
 
off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
 
3  who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off 
them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for 
 
the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
