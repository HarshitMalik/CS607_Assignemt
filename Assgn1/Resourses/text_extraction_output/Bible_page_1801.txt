  1802    Ezekiel 23 
28  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, 
seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the 
Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken. 
29  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised 
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have 
 
oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
30  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the 
hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should 
not destroy it: but I found none. 
 
31  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have 
 
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I 
 
recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God.

The Two Sisters 
1  The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 
2  Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
 
3  and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed 
 
whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and 
 
there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
4  And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her 
sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus 
 
were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
 
5  Â¶ And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted 
 
on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, 
6  which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them 
desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
7  Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that 
were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: 
 
with all their idols she defiled herself. 
8  Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her 
 
youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her 
virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
