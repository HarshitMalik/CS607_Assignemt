  2465    2 Corinthians 7 
16  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are 
 
the temple of the living God; as God hath said, 
 
I will dwell in them, and walk in them; 
 
and I will be their God, 
and they shall be my people.  
17  Wherefore come out from among them, 
and be ye separate, 
saith the Lord, 
and touch not the unclean thing;  
 
and I will receive you, 
18  and will be a Father unto you, 
and ye shall be my sons and daughters,  
saith the Lord Almighty.

our hearts to die and live with you. 
4  Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of 
you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our 
 
tribulation. 
5  ¶ For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,

comforted us by the coming of Titus;
