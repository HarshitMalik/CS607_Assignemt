  746    2 Samuel 21 
6  let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang 
them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, whom the Lord did 
choose. And the king said, I will give them. 
7  ¶ But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son 
of Saul, because of the Lord’s oath that was between them, 
between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.  
8  But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, 
whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five 
 
sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for 
Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: 
 
9  and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they 
hanged them in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seven 
 
together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first 
days, in the beginning of barley harvest. 
10  ¶ And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for 
her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water 
dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of 
the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
11  And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the 
concubine of Saul, had done. 
12  And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of 
Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen 
them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had 
hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:  
 
13  and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of 
Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were 
 
hanged. 
14  And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the 
country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: 
 
and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that 
God was entreated for the land.
