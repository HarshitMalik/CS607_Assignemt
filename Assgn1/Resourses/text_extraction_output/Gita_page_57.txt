THE YOGA OF WISDOM
Katham etadvijaaneeyaam twam aadau proktavaan iti.
Arjuna said:
4. Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to
understand that Thou didst teach this Yoga in the beginning?
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Bahooni me vyateetaani janmaani tava chaarjuna;
Taanyaham veda sarvaani na twam vettha parantapa.
The Blessed Lord said:
5. Many births of Mine have passed, as well as of thine, O Arjuna! I know them all but thou
knowest not, O Parantapa!
Ajo’pi sannavyayaatmaa bhootaanaam eeshwaro’pi san;
Prakritim swaam adhishthaaya sambhavaamyaatmamaayayaa.
6. Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings,
yet, ruling over My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.
Yadaa yadaa hi dharmasya glaanir bhavati bhaarata;
Abhyutthaanam adharmasya tadaatmaanam srijaamyaham.
7. Whenever there is a decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then
I manifest Myself!
COMMENTARY: That which elevates a man and helps him to reach the goal of life and
attain knowledge is Dharma (righteousness); that which drags him into worldliness is
unrighteousness. That which helps a man to attain liberation is Dharma; that which makes him
irreligious is Adharma or unrighteousness.
Paritraanaaya saadhoonaam vinaashaaya cha dushkritaam;
Dharma samsthaapanaarthaaya sambhavaami yuge yuge.
8. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment
of righteousness, I am born in every age.
Janma karma cha me divyam evam yo vetti tattwatah;
Tyaktwa deham punarjanma naiti maameti so’rjuna.
9. He who thus knows in true light My divine birth and action, after having abandoned the
body is not born again; he comes to Me, O Arjuna!
Veetaraagabhayakrodhaa manmayaa maam upaashritaah;
Bahavo jnaana tapasaa pootaa madbhaavam aagataah.
