  261    Leviticus 14 
the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the 
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
26  And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left 
hand: 
 
27  and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that 
is in his left hand seven times before the Lord: 
 
28  and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of 
the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of 
his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the 
place of the blood of the trespass offering: 
 
29  and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon 
the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for 
him before the Lord. 
30  And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young 
pigeons, such as he can get; 
 
31  even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other 
for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall 
 
make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord. 
32  This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand 
is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. 
33  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
34  When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a 
possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of 
your possession; 
 
35  and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 
It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 
 
36  then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before 
the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be 
not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the 
 
house: 
 
37  and he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the 
walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which 
in sight are lower than the wall; 
 
38  then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, 
and shut up the house seven days:
