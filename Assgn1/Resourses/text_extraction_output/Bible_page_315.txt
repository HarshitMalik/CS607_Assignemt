  316    Numbers 5 
the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath 
trespassed. 
8  But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, 
let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord, even to the priest; 
 
beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be 
made for him.  
9  And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, 
which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. 
10  And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man 
 
giveth the priest, it shall be his. 
The Law concerning Jealousy 
11  ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
12  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s 
wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 
13  and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her 
husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no 
witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner; 
 
14  and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his 
wife, and she be defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, 
 
and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 
 
15  then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring 
her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he 
 
shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an 
 
offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to 
remembrance. 
16  ¶ And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the Lord: 
 
17  and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the 
 
dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and 
put it into the water: 
 
18  and the priest shall set the woman before the Lord, and uncover 
the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, 
which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand 
 
the bitter water that causeth the curse:
