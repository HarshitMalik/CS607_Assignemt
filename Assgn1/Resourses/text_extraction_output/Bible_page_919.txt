The Descendants of Issachar 
1  Now the sons of Issachar were, Tola, and Puah, Jashub, and 
Shimrom, four. 
2  And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, 
 
and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their fatherâ€™s house, to wit, of 
Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose 
   
number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six 
hundred. 
3  And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael, 
     
and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men. 
 
4  And with them, by their generations, after the house of their 
fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand men: 
 
for they had many wives and sons. 
5  And their brethren among all the families of Issachar were valiant 
men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and 
seven thousand.
