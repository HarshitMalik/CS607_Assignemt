  1658    Jeremiah 22 
wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the 
widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. 
4  For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates 
of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in 
chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
5  But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the 
Lord, that this house shall become a desolation. 
6  For thus saith the Lord unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou art 
 
Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make 
 
thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. 
7  And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his 
weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them 
 
into the fire. 
8  And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every 
man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto 
this great city? 
 
9  Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant 
of the Lord their God, and worshipped other gods, and served 
them. 
10  ¶ Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for 
 
him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native 
 
country. 
11  ¶ For thus saith the Lord touching Shallum the son of Josiah king 
of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went 
forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more: 
   
12  but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and 
shall see this land no more. 
13  ¶ Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and 
his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbor’s service without 
 
wages, and giveth him not for his work; 
 
14  that saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and 
cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted 
 
with vermilion.
