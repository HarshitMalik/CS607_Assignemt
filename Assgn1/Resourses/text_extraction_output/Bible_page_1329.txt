  1330    Psalms 96 
and the sheep of his hand. 
Today if ye will hear his voice, 
8  harden not your heart, as in the provocation, 
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: 
 
9  when your fathers tempted me, 
proved me, and saw my work. 
10  Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, 
and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, 
and they have not known my ways: 
 
11  unto whom I sware in my wrath 
that they should not enter into my rest.

A Song of Praise 
1  O sing unto the Lord a new song: 
 
sing unto the Lord, all the earth. 
2  Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; 
 
show forth his salvation from day to day. 
3  Declare his glory among the heathen, 
his wonders among all people. 
4  For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: 
 
he is to be feared above all gods. 
5  For all the gods of the nations are idols: 
 
but the Lord made the heavens. 
6  Honor and majesty are before him: 
 
strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
7  Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, 
give unto the Lord glory and strength. 
8  Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: 
 
bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
9  O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness:  
 
fear before him, all the earth. 
10  Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth:
