  424    Deuteronomy 6 
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou 
risest up. 
8  And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they 
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 
9  And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy 
gates.  
Warnings against Disobedience 
10  ¶ And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee 
into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to 
Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou 
buildedst not, 
11  and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells 
digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which 
thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; 
   
12  then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth 
out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
13  Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear 
by his name. 
14  Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are 
round about you; 
 
15  (for the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you;) lest the anger 
 
of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee 
from off the face of the earth. 
16  ¶ Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in 
Massah.  
17  Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, 
and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded 
thee. 
18  And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the 
Lord; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in 
 
and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, 
19  to cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath 
spoken.
