  171    Exodus 20 
2  ¶ I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land 
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
3  ¶ Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
4  ¶ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness 
of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, 
or that is in the water under the earth: 
 
5  thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
 
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers 
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that 
hate me; 
 
6  and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep 
my commandments.  
7  ¶ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for 
 
the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
8  ¶ Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  
9  Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: 
 
10  but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou 
 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy 
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger 
that is within thy gates: 
 
11  for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord 
 
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  
12  ¶ Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long 
 
upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  
13  ¶ Thou shalt not kill.  
14  ¶ Thou shalt not commit adultery.  
15  ¶ Thou shalt not steal.  
16  ¶ Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.  
17  ¶ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet 
thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor 
his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s.
