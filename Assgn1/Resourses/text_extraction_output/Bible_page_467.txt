  468    Deuteronomy 26 
blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou 
 
shalt not forget it.  
26 
The Firstfruits and the Tithe 
1  And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and 
dwellest therein; 
 
2  that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which 
thou shalt bring of thy land that the Lord thy God giveth thee, and 
shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord 
thy God shall choose to place his name there.  
3  And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and 
say unto him, I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am 
come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for 
to give us. 
4  And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it 
down before the altar of the Lord thy God. 
5  Â¶ And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian 
ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and 
 
sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, 
mighty, and populous: 
 
6  and the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon 
us hard bondage: 
 
7  and when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord 
heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labor, and 
our oppression: 
 
8  and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, 
and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and 
with signs, and with wonders: 
 
9  and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, 
even a land that floweth with milk and honey.
