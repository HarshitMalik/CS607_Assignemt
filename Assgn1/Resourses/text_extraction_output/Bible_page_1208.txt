  1209    Psalms 9 
that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
3  When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, 
the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 
 
4  what is man, that thou art mindful of him? 
 
and the son of man, that thou visitest him?  
 
5  For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, 
and hast crowned him with glory and honor. 
6  Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; 
 
thou hast put all things under his feet:  
 
7  all sheep and oxen, 
yea, and the beasts of the field; 
 
8  the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, 
and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
9  O Lord our Lord, 
how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

A Psalm of David. 
1  I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; 
 
I will show forth all thy marvelous works. 
2  I will be glad and rejoice in thee: 
 
I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. 
3  When mine enemies are turned back, 
they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 
4  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; 
 
thou satest in the throne judging right. 
5  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, 
thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 
6  O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: 
 
and thou hast destroyed cities;
