God’s Covenant with David 
1  And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord 
had given him rest round about from all his enemies; 
 
2  that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a 
house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 
3  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for 
 
the Lord is with thee. 
4  ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came 
unto Nathan, saying, 
5  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou 
build me a house for me to dwell in? 
 
6  Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I 
brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but 
have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
7  In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel 
spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded 
to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me a house of 
cedar? 
 
8  Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith 
the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following 
the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 
 
9  and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off 
all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great 
name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
10  Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant 
them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no 
more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any 
 
more, as beforetime,
