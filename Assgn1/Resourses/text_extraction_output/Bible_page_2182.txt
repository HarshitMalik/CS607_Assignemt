  2183    Luke 9 
55  And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he 
 
commanded to give her meat. 
56  And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they 
 
should tell no man what was done.

The Mission of the Twelve 
1  Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power 
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
2  And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the 
sick. 
3  And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither 
staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two 
 
coats apiece. 
4  And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence 
depart. 
5  And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, 
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.  
6  And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the 
gospel, and healing every where. 
The Death of John the Baptist 
7  Â¶ Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and 
 
he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was 
risen from the dead; 
 
8  and of some, that Elijah had appeared; and of others, that one of 
 
the old prophets was risen again.  
9  And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I 
 
hear such things? And he desired to see him.
