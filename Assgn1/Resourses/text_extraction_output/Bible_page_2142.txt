  2143    Mark 14 
The Young Man Who Fled 
51  ¶ And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen 
cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on 
 
him: 
 
52  and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 
Jesus before the Council 
53  ¶ And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were 
 
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
54  And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high 
priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 
 
55  And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against 
Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 
 
56  For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed 
not together. 
57  And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 
58  We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with 
hands, and within three days I will build another made without 
hands.  
59  But neither so did their witness agree together. 
60  And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, 
Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against 
 
thee? 
 
61  But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest 
asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the 
Blessed? 
 
62  And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the 
 
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  
63  Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any 
further witnesses? 
 
64  Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all 
   
condemned him to be guilty of death.
