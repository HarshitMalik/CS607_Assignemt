  1645    Jeremiah 15 
ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to 
 
the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord. 
10  ¶ Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife 
and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on 
 
usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them 
 
doth curse me. 
11  ¶ The Lord said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I 
 
will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in 
the time of affliction. 
12  Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 
 
13  Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without 
price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. 
14  And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which 
thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall 
 
burn upon you. 
The Lord’s Assurance to Jeremiah 
15  ¶ O Lord, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge 
 
me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy long-suffering: 
   
know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. 
16  Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto 
 
me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, 
 
O Lord God of hosts. 
17  I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone 
 
because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
 
18  Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth 
to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters 
 
that fail? 
 
19  ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring 
thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth 
 
the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them 
 
return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
