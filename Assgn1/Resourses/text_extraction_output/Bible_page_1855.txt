  1856    Ezekiel 44 
2  Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be 
 
opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord the God 
 
of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. 
3  It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before 
 
the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and 
 
shall go out by the way of the same. 
4  ¶ Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: 
 
and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of 
the Lord: and I fell upon my face. 
 
5  And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold 
with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee 
concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the 
laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with 
 
every going forth of the sanctuary. 
6  And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, 
Thus saith the Lord God; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of 
 
all your abominations, 
7  in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised 
in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to 
pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the 
blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your 
abominations. 
8  And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have 
 
set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. 
9  ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, 
 
nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any 
stranger that is among the children of Israel. 
10  And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went 
astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall 
 
even bear their iniquity. 
11  Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the 
gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the 
 
burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand 
before them to minister unto them.
