  1846    Ezekiel 40 
16  And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their 
posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and 
 
windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm 
 
trees. 
17  ¶ Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were 
chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty 
 
chambers were upon the pavement. 
18  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of 
the gates was the lower pavement. 
19  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate 
unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits 
eastward and northward. 
20  ¶ And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, 
he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 
21  And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on 
that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after 
 
the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and 
 
the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
22  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were 
after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they 
 
went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before 
 
them. 
23  And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the 
north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate a 
 
hundred cubits. 
24  ¶ After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate 
toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof, and the 
 
arches thereof, according to these measures. 
25  And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, 
like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five 
 
and twenty cubits. 
26  And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were 
before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another 
 
on that side, upon the posts thereof.
