  414    Deuteronomy 3 
7  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to 
ourselves. 
8  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the 
Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of 
Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
 
9  (which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it 
 
Shenir;) 
 
10  all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto 
Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
11  For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; 
 
behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of 
 
the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and 
 
four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 
Reuben, Gad, and Half of Manasseh Settle East of the Jordan 
12  ¶ And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which 
is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, 
gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
13  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, 
gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with 
 
all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 
14  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the 
coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own 
 
name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day. 
15  And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
16  And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead 
even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto 
the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
 
17  the plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth 
even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-
pisgah eastward. 
18  ¶ And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God 
hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed
