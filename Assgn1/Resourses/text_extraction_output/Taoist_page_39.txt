Views of person and self are certainly thoughts, but so
are  views  of  attachment  to  religion,  and  these  must  be
eliminated  too.  If  you  consciously  try  to  stop  errant
thoughts, errant thoughts will instead seem to increase. Try
observing  what  the  thoughts  are  and  those  thoughts  will

To  cultivate  realization  it  is  essential  to  stop  thoughts.
To stop thoughts it is essential to observe mind. When you

ordinary  human  beings.  Do  not  destroy  them  either  and
you  will  avoid  falling  into  quietism.  The  all-at-once
teaching of the school of completeness is after all like this;
just  accord  with  original  nature  and  conscious  cognition

who  are  free  from  thoughts  after  having  had  thoughts
