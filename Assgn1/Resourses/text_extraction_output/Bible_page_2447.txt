  2448    1 Corinthians 14 
9  So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be 
understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall 
 
speak into the air. 
10  There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and 
none of them is without signification. 
11  Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto 
him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a 
barbarian unto me. 
12  Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye 
may excel to the edifying of the church. 
13  ¶ Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that 
he may interpret. 
14  For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my 
understanding is unfruitful. 
15  What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the 
 
understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with 
 
the understanding also. 
16  Else, when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that 
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of 
thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? 
 
17  For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 
18  I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 
 
19  yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my 
understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten 
thousand words in an unknown tongue. 
20  ¶ Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be 
 
ye children, but in understanding be men. 
21  In the law it is written, 
With men of other tongues and other lips 
will I speak unto this people; 
 
and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  
22  Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to 
them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that 
 
believe not, but for them which believe.
