  124    Genesis 50 
we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy 
father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
18  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they 
 
said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
19  And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
   
20  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto 
 
good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 
21  Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. 
 
And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. 
22  ¶ And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph 
 
lived a hundred and ten years. 
23  And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the 
 
children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon 
Joseph’s knees. 
24  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and God will surely visit 
 
you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to 
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
25  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will 
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.  
26  So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they 
 
embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
