Wash the vessel, sit down and anoint it with fragrance; then, go out and get the milk. 
Add  the  rennet  of  clear  consciousness  to the milk of good deeds, and then, free of 
desire, let it curdle.  || 1 ||   Chant the Name of the One Lord. All other actions are 
fruitless. || 1 ||  Pause  ||   Let your mind be the handles, and then churn it, without 
sleeping. If you chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord ,with your tongue, then the curd 
will be churned. In this way, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained.  || 2 ||   Wash your mind 
in the pool of Truth, and let it be the vessel of the Lord; let this be your offering to 
please Him. That humble servant who dedicates and offers his life, and who serves in 
this way, remains absorbed in his Lord and Master.  || 3 ||   The speakers speak and 
speak and speak, and then they depart. There is no other to compare to You. Servant 
Nanak, lacking devotion, humbly prays: may I sing the Praises of the True Lord.  || 4 ||

Deep  within  the  self,  the  Lord abides; do not go outside  looking for Him. You have 
renounced the Ambrosial Nectar — why are you eating poison?  || 1 ||   Meditate on 
such spiritual wisdom, O my mind, and become the slave of the True Lord.  || 1 ||  
Pause  ||   Everyone speaks of wisdom and meditation; but bound in  bondage, the 
whole world is wandering around in confusion.  || 2 ||   One who serves the Lord is His 
servant. The Lord is pervading and permeating the water, the land, and the sky.  || 3 ||   
I am not good; no one is bad. Prays Nanak, He alone saves us!  || 4 || 1 || 2 ||
