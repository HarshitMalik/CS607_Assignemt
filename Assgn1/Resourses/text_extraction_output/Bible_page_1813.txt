  1814    Ezekiel 27 
20  Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 
21  Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in 
lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants. 
 
22  The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: 
 
they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all 
precious stones, and gold. 
23  Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, 
and Chilmad, were thy merchants. 
24  These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and 
broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, 
and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 
25  Â¶ The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou 
 
wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 
26  Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath 
 
broken thee in the midst of the seas. 
27  Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy 
pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all 
thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in 
the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of 
thy ruin. 
28  The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 
29  And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the 
sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the 
land; 
 
30  and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry 
bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow 
themselves in the ashes: 
 
31  and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them 
with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of 
heart and bitter wailing. 
32  And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and 
lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed 
in the midst of the sea?
