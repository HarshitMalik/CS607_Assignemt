  2184    Luke 9 
The Feeding of the Five Thousand 
10  ¶ And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they 
had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert 
place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. 
11  And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received 
 
them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed 
them that had need of healing. 
12  And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and 
said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the 
towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we 
 
are here in a desert place. 
13  But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have 
no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and 
 
buy meat for all this people. 
14  For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his 
disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. 
15  And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
16  Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to 
heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set 
before the multitude. 
17  And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of 
 
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. 
Peter’s Declaration 
18  ¶ And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were 
with him; and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I 
 
am? 
 
19  They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and 
   
others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.  
20  He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering 
 
said, The Christ of God.
