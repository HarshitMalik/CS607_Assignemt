streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, 
They have their reward. 
3  But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy 
right hand doeth: 
 
4  that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in 
 
secret himself shall reward thee openly. 
Jesus’ Teaching on Prayer 
5  ¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: 
 
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners 
of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, 
They have their reward. 
6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou 
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy 
 
Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
7  ¶ But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for 
 
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 
8  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what 
 
things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 
9  After this manner therefore pray ye: 
 
Our Father which art in heaven, 
Hallowed be thy name. 
10  Thy kingdom come. 
Thy will be done 
in earth, as it is in heaven. 
11  Give us this day our daily bread. 
12  And forgive us our debts, 
as we forgive our debtors. 
13  And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil: 
 
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. 
Amen. 
14  For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also 
forgive you:
