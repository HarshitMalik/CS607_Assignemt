  939    1 Chronicles 15 
15 
The Ark Brought to Jerusalem 
1  And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a 
place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
2  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the 
Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, 
 
and to minister unto him for ever.  
3  And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the 
ark of the Lord unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 
4  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
 
5  of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred 
 
and twenty: 
 
6  of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two 
 
hundred and twenty: 
 
7  of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred 
 
and thirty: 
 
8  of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two 
 
hundred: 
 
9  of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
   
10  of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a 
 
hundred and twelve. 
11  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the 
Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and 
Amminadab, 
12  and said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: 
 
sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up 
the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared 
for it. 
13  For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a 
breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
14  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the 
ark of the Lord God of Israel.
