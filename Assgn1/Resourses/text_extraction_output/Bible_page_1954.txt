  1955    Micah 4 
4  Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he 
 
will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved 
themselves ill in their doings. 
5  ¶ Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my 
people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that 
 
putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him: 
 
6  Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; 
 
and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun 
 
shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over 
them. 
7  Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, 
 
they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. 
 
8  But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of 
judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, 
and to Israel his sin. 
9  ¶ Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes 
of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 
10  They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
11  The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach 
for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they 
 
lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil 
 
can come upon us. 
12  Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and 
Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as 
the high places of the forest.

The Lord’s Universal Reign 
1  But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the 
house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, 
and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. 
 
2  And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to 
the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
