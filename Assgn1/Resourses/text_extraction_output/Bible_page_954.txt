  955    1 Chronicles 23 
11  Now, my son, the Lord be with thee; and prosper thou, and build 
 
the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee. 
12  Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee 
charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the 
Lord thy God. 
13  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes 
and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning 
Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.  
   
14  Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the 
Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand 
thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for 
   
it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou 
   
mayest add thereto. 
15  Moreover, there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and 
workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for 
every manner of work. 
16  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no 
number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee. 
17  Â¶ David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon 
his son, saying, 
18  Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest 
 
on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into 
 
mine hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before 
 
his people. 
19  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise 
 
therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the 
ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into 
the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. 
23 
1  So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son 
king over Israel.
