  64    Genesis 27 
34  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great 
and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me 
also, O my father. 
35  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away 
thy blessing. 
36  And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted 
 
me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now 
   
he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not 
reserved a blessing for me? 
 
37  And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him 
thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and 
 
with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now 
 
unto thee, my son? 
 
38  And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my 
father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his 
 
voice, and wept.  
39  ¶ And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, 
Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, 
and of the dew of heaven from above; 
 
40  and by thy sword shalt thou live, 
and shalt serve thy brother: 
 
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, 
that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  
Jacob Flees from Esau 
41  ¶ And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his 
father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of 
 
mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother 
 
Jacob. 
42  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and 
 
she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, 
Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, 
purposing to kill thee.
