  687    1 Samuel 28 
10  And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, 
there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. 
11  Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he 
 
said, Bring me up Samuel. 
12  And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and 
 
the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for 
 
thou art Saul. 
13  And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? 
   
And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the 
earth. 
14  And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old 
 
man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul 
 
perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the 
ground, and bowed himself. 
15  ¶ And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring 
me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines 
   
make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth 
me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have 
 
called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. 
16  Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the 
Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 
 
17  And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord 
 
hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy 
neighbor, even to David: 
 
18  because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst 
his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this 
thing unto thee this day. 
19  Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand 
of the Philistines: and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with 
 
me: the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of 
 
the Philistines. 
20  ¶ Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore 
afraid, because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength 
 
in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
