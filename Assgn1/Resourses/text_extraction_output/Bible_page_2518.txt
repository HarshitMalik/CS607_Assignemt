  2519    1 Thessalonians 4 
4  For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we 
should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. 
 
5  For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your 
faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our 
labor be in vain. 
6  ¶ But now when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us 
good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good 
remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to 
see you: 
 
7  therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our 
affliction and distress by your faith: 
 
8  for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
9  For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy 
wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
 
10  night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and 
might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
 
11  ¶ Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
direct our way unto you. 
12  And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward 
another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: 
 
13  to the end he may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness 
before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ 
with all his saints.

A Life Pleasing to God 
1  Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the 
Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and 
to please God, so ye would abound more and more. 
2  For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 
3  For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should 
abstain from fornication:
