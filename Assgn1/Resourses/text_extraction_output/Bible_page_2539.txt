  2540    2 Timothy 3 
20  ¶ But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of 
silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some 
 
to dishonor. 
21  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel 
unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared 
unto every good work. 
22  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, 
 
peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
23  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do 
gender strifes. 
24  And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all 
 
men, apt to teach, patient; 
 
25  in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God 
 
peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of 
the truth; 
 
26  and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, 
who are taken captive by him at his will.

The Character of Men in the Last Days 
1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, 
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
3  without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, 
incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
4  traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers 
of God; 
 
5  having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from 
 
such turn away. 
6  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive 
silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
7  ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the 
truth.
