  2372    Acts 23 
Paul in the Custody of the Chief Captain 
22  ¶ And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up 
their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it 
 
is not fit that he should live. 
23  And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into 
the air, 
24  the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, 
and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might 
 
know wherefore they cried so against him. 
25  And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion 
that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, 
and uncondemned? 
 
26  When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, 
saying, Take heed what thou doest; for this man is a Roman. 
 
27  Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a 
Roman? He said, Yea. 
 
28  And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this 
freedom. And Paul said, But I was free-born. 
29  Then straightway they departed from him which should have 
examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew 
 
that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
Paul before the Council 
30  ¶ On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty 
wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his 
bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to 
appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. 
23 
1  And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, 
I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
